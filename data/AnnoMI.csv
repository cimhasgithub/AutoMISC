0,0,['OQ'],Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down?,therapist
0,1,['N'],Sure.,client
0,2,['GI'],"So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-",therapist
0,3,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
0,4,['GI'],-and you usually have three to four drinks when you do drink.,therapist
0,5,['N'],Usually three drinks and glasses of wine.,client
0,6,['GI'],Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week.,therapist
0,7,['N'],Something like that.,client
0,8,['GI'],"Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that.",therapist
0,9,['N'],Okay.,client
0,10,['OQ'],"Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking.",therapist
0,11,['N'],"Well, I usually drink when I'm at home trying to unwind and I drink while I'm watching a movie. And sometimes, um, I take a bath but I also drink when I take a bath sometimes.",client
0,12,['OQ'],"Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?",therapist
0,13,['N'],Okay.,client
0,14,['GI'],"Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women.",therapist
0,15,['N'],Hmm. Seven?,client
0,16,['GI'],Seven.,therapist
0,17,['N'],Wow. I knew my doctor didn't like me drinking the amount that I did but I didn't know that seven was the limit.,client
0,18,['OQ'],"Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?",therapist
0,19,['N'],Yes. What-what kind of health problems?,client
0,20,['GI'],"Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat.",therapist
0,21,['N'],"Hmm. Well, that's not good news.",client
0,22,['OQ'],"Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced?",therapist
0,23,['N'],"Well, to be honest, I drink sometimes when I'm feeling down and I find it more interesting and not so blur.",client
0,24,['OQ'],Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?,therapist
0,25,['N'],"Well, then I feel blur again.",client
0,26,['GI'],"So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to.",therapist
0,27,['N'],Yes on occasion.,client
0,28,['GI'],And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.,therapist
0,29,['N'],Sometimes I just don't like how much I drink. I sometimes finish a bottle in one night.,client
0,30,['OQ'],So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?,therapist
0,31,['N'],"No, it's not like I get crazy or anything but I just don't like the amount that I'm drinking.",client
0,32,['SR'],"Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink.",therapist
0,33,['N'],"Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking.",client
0,34,['OQ'],Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?,therapist
0,35,['C'],"Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week. That seems like a lot but I would consider cutting back to two drinks a night. I think that would be my goal.",client
0,36,['OQ'],"If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?",therapist
0,37,['C'],I'd say an eight.,client
0,38,['OQ'],Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?,therapist
0,39,['C'],"Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse.",client
0,40,['OQ'],What would help you cut back to two drinks?,therapist
0,41,['C'],Maybe having less wine in the house.,client
0,42,"['OQ', 'SR']",Having less wine in the house will help?,therapist
0,43,['C'],Yes.,client
0,44,['OQ'],What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?,therapist
0,45,['N'],"Well, I like to watch movies, read a book, and take a bath but sometimes I drink when I take a bath.",client
0,46,['SR'],"So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too.",therapist
0,47,['N'],Mm-hmm. Yes.,client
0,48,"['CR', 'NEGO']","Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.",therapist
0,49,['C'],Yes.,client
0,50,['OQ'],Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?,therapist
0,51,['C'],Sure.,client
0,52,['O'],"Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds.",therapist
0,53,['C'],Okay.,client
1,0,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?",therapist
1,1,['N'],Sure.,client
1,2,['SR'],"Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?",therapist
1,3,['S'],"Yeah, but only on the weekend.",client
1,4,['SR'],"Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks.",therapist
1,5,['N'],"Yeah. Uh, maybe a couple more.",client
1,6,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?",therapist
1,7,['S'],"So, uh, are you saying I drink too much?",client
1,8,['OQ'],How would you define drinking too much?,therapist
1,9,['S'],"Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything.",client
1,10,['GI'],"Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk.",therapist
1,11,['S'],So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure?,client
1,12,"['CQ', 'SR']",So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?,therapist
1,13,['S'],I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me.,client
1,14,"['CR', 'GI']","You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people.",therapist
1,15,['S'],"Well, I don't consider my drinking binge drinking.",client
1,16,['CQ'],Why is that?,therapist
1,17,['S'],I don't chug a lot of beers in a row. I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening.,client
1,18,['GI'],"Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion.",therapist
1,19,['S'],But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about?,client
1,20,['GI'],"Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen.",therapist
1,21,['N'],"Well, I didn't know about those things.",client
1,22,['OQ'],"Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?",therapist
1,23,['S'],"Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me.",client
1,24,['OQ'],And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?,therapist
1,25,['C'],"Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about.",client
1,26,['CR'],"So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?",therapist
1,27,['C'],E-exactly.,client
1,28,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?",therapist
1,29,['N'],"Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about.",client
1,30,['OQ'],"Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?",therapist
1,31,['N'],"Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then.",client
1,32,['SR'],"So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?",therapist
1,33,['N'],Yeah.,client
1,34,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you.",therapist
1,35,['N'],Sounds good.,client
1,36,['NEGO'],"Okay, great. See you next time.",therapist
2,0,['OQ'],"Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going?",therapist
2,1,['N'],"Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back.",client
2,2,['OQ'],"Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?",therapist
2,3,['N'],"No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it.",client
2,4,"['OQ', 'SR']","All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds.",therapist
2,5,['C'],"I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up.",client
2,6,"['OQ', 'SR']",But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight.,therapist
2,7,['C'],I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do.,client
2,8,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back.",therapist
2,9,['S'],"Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it.",client
2,10,['OQ'],And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?,therapist
2,11,['N'],"To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner.",client
2,12,"['CQ', 'GI']","John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?",therapist
2,13,['N'],"No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving?",client
2,14,"['GI', 'OQ']","You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?",therapist
2,15,['C'],"Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter.",client
2,16,['OQ'],"Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?",therapist
2,17,['C'],"Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ.",client
2,18,"['GI', 'OQ']","Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in.",therapist
2,19,['C'],"Um, six or seven.",client
2,20,"['OQ', 'SR']","All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?",therapist
2,21,['C'],I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight.,client
2,22,['SR'],"So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?",therapist
2,23,['C'],Yes.,client
2,24,"['OQ', 'SR']","But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?",therapist
2,25,['C'],"Getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it. My wife does the shopping for us, so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice, that would solve it.",client
2,26,"['OPTI', 'OQ']","Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?",therapist
2,27,['C'],"I suppose I could replace it with, um, a low-calorie drink or drink more water.",client
2,28,"['OQ', 'SR']","Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?",therapist
2,29,['C'],"I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with, um, sugar-free drinks.",client
2,30,"['OQ', 'SR']","Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?",therapist
2,31,['C'],A 10.,client
2,32,"['GI', 'OQ']","I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think?",therapist
2,33,['C'],Great. It sounds good to me.,client
2,34,['GI'],Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks.,therapist
2,35,['N'],Okay.,client
3,0,['N'],"Well see, my-my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is. I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't see what the big deal is.",client
3,1,"['CR', 'OQ']","Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?",therapist
3,2,['N'],I-I-I feel fine.,client
3,3,['O'],Okay.,therapist
3,4,['N'],"I mean, my-my work is really man-manual labor-intensive so I'm usually working out in-in the hot sun the majority of the day, so I'm usually sweating out any like bad things I put in my system, so—",client
3,5,['OQ'],"Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?",therapist
3,6,['N'],"Well, a little bit, but nothing too-- you know. I'm not blo- I'm not bloated or anything.",client
3,7,['OQ'],Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?,therapist
3,8,['N'],"Well, yeah, I've been to the doctor about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up to be fine, so—",client
3,9,['CQ'],Okay. But you feel that you feel good?,therapist
3,10,['N'],Yeah.,client
3,11,"['CR', 'OQ']","Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?",therapist
3,12,['N'],"Well, I mean, not really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places kinda makes you feel a little bit better about your situation.",client
3,13,['OQ'],"Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?",therapist
3,14,['N'],Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33],client
3,15,['O'],Okay. Good.,therapist
4,0,['O'],"Hi, Emily.",therapist
4,1,['N'],Hi.,client
4,2,['O'],It's been a while.,therapist
4,3,['N'],"Yeah, it's been a while.",client
4,4,['SR'],This is something new.,therapist
4,5,['N'],"Oh, oh, yeah, the—Yeah",client
4,6,['CQ'],You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?,therapist
4,7,['N'],About a month.,client
4,8,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
4,9,['N'],Yeah.,client
4,10,['OQ'],What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?,therapist
4,11,['N'],"Um, I don't know. I just felt like something different. I was getting bored and, I don't know, it's kind of nice to stand out a bit, I guess.",client
4,12,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
4,13,['N'],"Yeah, change.",client
4,14,['O'],"Yeah, and it looks nice.",therapist
4,15,['N'],Thanks.,client
4,16,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?",therapist
4,17,['N'],"I don't actually, really. I-I mean, I'm sure that it might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much it will impact that much. I've pretty good teeth. I don't know.",client
4,18,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
4,19,['N'],I don't really know [unintelligible 00:01:04],client
4,20,['O'],You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-,therapist
4,21,['N'],[laughs] Thanks.,client
4,22,['O'],-every time you come in.,therapist
4,23,['N'],Yeah.,client
4,24,['GI'],"Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.",therapist
4,25,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
4,26,['GI'],"Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-",therapist
4,27,['N'],"Oh, yeah.",client
4,28,"['GI', 'OQ']",-just from contact with it. I wonder what are your thoughts about that?,therapist
4,29,['C'],"Well, I definitely don't want it mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-",client
4,30,['SR'],"Yes, flossing.",therapist
4,31,['C'],"Um, which I'm not doing but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause-- Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the chipping.",client
4,32,['SR'],There's nothing yet.,therapist
4,33,['N'],I guess I'm not paying attention to it.,client
4,34,['SR'],"Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.",therapist
4,35,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
4,36,['OQ'],"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me?""",therapist
4,37,['C'],"I don't know, I guess if I started to see that it was actually causing a problem, then I might.",client
4,38,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
4,39,['N'],"But for now-- I mean, I just got and-",client
4,40,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
4,41,['S'],-and it looks pretty cool.,client
4,42,['O'],I guess that it does.,therapist
4,43,['N'],"Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah.",client
4,44,['ADVI'],"Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-",therapist
4,45,['N'],Yeah.,client
4,46,['ADVI'],-really watch-,therapist
4,47,['N'],Yeah.,client
4,48,['ADVI'],-the effect? Okay.,therapist
4,49,['C'],"Yeah. I guess if I really start to see a problem-- I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I'm hoping-",client
4,50,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
4,51,['N'],-will kind of stick [unintelligible 00:02:30],client
4,52,['O'],"Emily, you said it so well it-",therapist
4,53,['N'],Yeah.,client
4,54,"['ADVI', 'SR']","-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-",therapist
4,55,['N'],Yeah.,client
4,56,['O'],"-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-",therapist
4,57,['N'],Yeah.,client
4,58,['O'],"-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-",therapist
5,0,['O'],"Hi, Billy.",therapist
5,1,['N'],Hi.,client
5,2,['O'],"Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time.",therapist
5,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,4,['O'],"You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that?",therapist
5,5,['N'],"Yeah, no, it's easy.",client
5,6,['OQ'],"Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting?",therapist
5,7,['N'],Uh. Meeting's definitely helped.,client
5,8,['O'],Yeah?,therapist
5,9,['N'],Yeah. It's helped-,client
5,10,['O'],Yeah?,therapist
5,11,['N'],-heaps.,client
5,12,['CQ'],It's helped heaps?,therapist
5,13,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,14,['OQ'],"Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?",therapist
5,15,['N'],"Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check.",client
5,16,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?",therapist
5,17,['C'],"Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff-",client
5,18,['O'],Mm.,therapist
5,19,['C'],"-and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that.",client
5,20,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,21,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,22,['CR'],"Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal.",therapist
5,23,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,24,['OQ'],"Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?",therapist
5,25,['N'],Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly.,client
5,26,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?",therapist
5,27,['C'],"I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier.",client
5,28,['O'],Mm.,therapist
5,29,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,30,['OQ'],"Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time.",therapist
5,31,['C'],"Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful.",client
5,32,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,33,['N'],[clears throat],client
5,34,['CQ'],"Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?",therapist
5,35,['N'],"[clears throat] Oh, I just said-- I said, ""Uh, could you give me a hand with this?""",client
5,36,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,37,['N'],"And, like, she filled them up for me, and I told her what to write.",client
5,38,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,39,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,40,['CQ'],"Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that [unintelligible 00:27:23] for you?",therapist
5,41,['N'],Just-- I-I asked her to fill that out for me because I said I'd be too messy.,client
5,42,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,43,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,44,['CR'],"So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you.",therapist
5,45,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,46,['OQ'],"And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?",therapist
5,47,['C'],"Like, a big difference, but, like, it's not like I don't try.",client
5,48,['O'],Mm.,therapist
5,49,['N'],"Like, I'm just not really good with it.",client
5,50,['O'],"Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing.",therapist
5,51,['N'],"Yeah. Like [unintelligible 00:28:13] if I'd got into polytech and stuff, so I think that's good.",client
5,52,['O'],Mm.,therapist
5,53,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,54,['CQ'],"So, where are the forms now?",therapist
5,55,['N'],They're still at home.,client
5,56,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,57,['N'],Yeah. If—,client
5,58,['OQ'],"So, what needs to happen next?",therapist
5,59,['C'],Just take them in.,client
5,60,['CQ'],"So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you?",therapist
5,61,['C'],"Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in.",client
5,62,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?",therapist
5,63,['C'],"Uh, probably by the end of this week.",client
5,64,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?",therapist
5,65,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,66,['CQ'],And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?,therapist
5,67,['N'],"I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do.",client
5,68,['O'],"Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-",therapist
5,69,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,70,['CQ'],"-and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?",therapist
5,71,['C'],"Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something.",client
5,72,['O'],Mm. Yeah?,therapist
5,73,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,74,['OQ'],"So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?",therapist
5,75,['C'],Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way.,client
5,76,['SR'],"So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?",therapist
5,77,['C'],Yeah.,client
5,78,['OQ'],"Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?",therapist
5,79,['S'],"Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy.",client
5,80,['SR'],Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend.,therapist
5,81,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,82,['CQ'],"So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or?",therapist
5,83,['S'],"Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight.",client
5,84,['CQ'],It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?,therapist
5,85,['C'],Yeah.,client
5,86,['CQ'],Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?,therapist
5,87,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,88,['SR'],"And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?",therapist
5,89,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,90,['OQ'],Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?,therapist
5,91,['S'],I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates.,client
5,92,['CR'],Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?,therapist
5,93,['C'],"Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do.",client
5,94,['OQ'],Mm. What do you think?,therapist
5,95,['C'],"Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh.",client
5,96,['O'],Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-,therapist
5,97,['N'],Mm.,client
5,98,['SR'],-kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea.,therapist
5,99,['C'],No.,client
5,100,['SR'],"So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?",therapist
5,101,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,102,['CQ'],So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah?,therapist
5,103,['N'],Mm.,client
5,104,['CR'],"And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future.",therapist
5,105,['S'],"Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment.",client
5,106,['OQ'],"Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?",therapist
5,107,['S'],Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking.,client
5,108,['CQ'],Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next-,therapist
5,109,['N'],Mm.,client
5,110,['CQ'],-kind of minute or so-,therapist
5,111,['S'],"No. Just, like, it's not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah.",client
5,112,['CQ'],So it's not your idea. And you also go along with it?,therapist
5,113,['S'],"Yeah. You can't really be like, ""Oh no,"" just give me shit.",client
5,114,['CQ'],Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no?,therapist
5,115,['N'],"Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don't know. And they'd talk me into it probably.",client
5,116,['SR'],Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-,therapist
5,117,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,118,['CR'],-'cause of what they- what they thought of you.,therapist
5,119,['N'],"They'd just think I was joking, yeah.",client
5,120,['O'],"Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna.",therapist
5,121,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,122,['O'],"So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys.",therapist
5,123,['N'],"I don't see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so-",client
5,124,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,125,['S'],"I don't think, like, I am not sure they like it.",client
5,126,['CQ'],Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna?,therapist
5,127,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,128,['CQ'],Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past?,therapist
5,129,['C'],They don't lead me into trouble. But-,client
5,130,['OQ'],Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it.,therapist
5,131,['N'],"Uh, like it's my choice though, they don't make me.",client
5,132,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
5,133,['N'],"Yeah. I know it's just having grown up with, it's just what we've always done.",client
5,134,['SR'],Okay. So that's just what you've always done.,therapist
5,135,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,136,['CR'],But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?,therapist
5,137,['N'],Mm.,client
5,138,['OQ'],Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?,therapist
5,139,['N'],"My life? Well, what do you mean?",client
5,140,['O'],"Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah.",therapist
5,141,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,142,"['OQ', 'SR']",When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?,therapist
5,143,['C'],I don't know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too.,client
5,144,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,145,['C'],"So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff.",client
5,146,['CQ'],"Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?",therapist
5,147,['N'],"Yeah, 'cause then we could hang out together and stuff-",client
5,148,['O'],Mm.,therapist
5,149,['N'],-with our girlfriends and stuff.,client
5,150,['SR'],So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-,therapist
5,151,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,152,['CQ'],-now that you're with Donna?,therapist
5,153,['C'],"Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but-",client
5,154,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
5,155,['N'],"-just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff.",client
5,156,['OQ'],"Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate?",therapist
5,157,['N'],"It's, like, loyal-",client
5,158,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
5,159,['N'],"-yes, someone who's got my back.",client
5,160,"['OQ', 'SR']","So, someone who's loyal, someone who's got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate?",therapist
5,161,['N'],That's about it. It's-- yeah.,client
5,162,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
5,163,['N'],Someone who'll stand up for you.,client
5,164,['SR'],"Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you?",therapist
5,165,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,166,['O'],Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate-,therapist
5,167,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,168,['OQ'],"-for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation?",therapist
5,169,['N'],"I mean, support me.",client
5,170,['OQ'],"Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy?",therapist
5,171,['N'],"Just don't give me shit about, I don't know. Um, yeah, just, if I- if I don't wanna go do something, don't, like, don't give me shit about it.",client
5,172,['O'],"Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds-",therapist
5,173,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,174,['SR'],-like these guys have been around for you-,therapist
5,175,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, they [unintelligible 00:36:38]",client
5,176,['CR'],"-for quite some time, and they're really important to you.",therapist
5,177,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,178,['OQ'],"Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, ""No, I don't wanna do that,"" and they're supportive of you?",therapist
5,179,['N'],Mm.,client
5,180,['OQ'],What do you think it would take?,therapist
5,181,['C'],Just they know that I'm serious.,client
5,182,['OQ'],"Okay. So, how would they know you're serious?",therapist
5,183,['C'],"I guess, like, if they actually know I'm going to polytech and stuff that they might understand.",client
5,184,['O'],Okay.,therapist
5,185,['C'],"But, like I feel guilty if they wanna go and have fun, and I'm not with them.",client
5,186,['O'],Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'.,therapist
5,187,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,188,['SR'],"Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that.",therapist
5,189,['C'],"Yeah. Like, just going out with them or spending some times with them-- time with them, but, like, I really wanna spend time with Donna too-",client
5,190,['O'],Mm.,therapist
5,191,['C'],"-so, it'd be cool if we could spend time together, like, with Donna and my mates.",client
5,192,['CR'],"Okay. So, it's almost as if you feel a bit torn because you wanna be with Donna, but you also wanna be with your-",therapist
5,193,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,194,['CR'],-with your mates?,therapist
5,195,['S'],"Yeah, like-- Well, I know I get into trouble with them, but they're still my mates, and I-",client
5,196,['O'],Mm.,therapist
5,197,['N'],-feel--,client
5,198,['SR'],"Yeah, so they're still important to you?",therapist
5,199,['N'],Yeah.,client
5,200,['SR'],Hmm. I also am hearing that you don't wanna get into trouble anymore.,therapist
5,201,['C'],No.,client
5,202,['O'],Mm. Yeah.,therapist
6,0,['O'],"Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today.",therapist
6,1,['N'],No problem.,client
6,2,['GI'],"I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.",therapist
6,3,['N'],"Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I'd say, but I'm here though.",client
6,4,['SR'],So you made it in here-,therapist
6,5,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
6,6,['OQ'],- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?,therapist
6,7,['S'],"I don't know, something about changing my life even more. You know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else have to do.",client
6,8,"['CQ', 'CR']","So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?",therapist
6,9,['S'],"Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. My wife's still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's with the baby right now. And I'm the only person that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these things that are going on in my life.",client
6,10,['SR'],Mm-hmm. Almost—,therapist
6,11,['N'],"Yeah, it's a lot.",client
6,12,['CR'],Almost overwhelming it sounds like.,therapist
6,13,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. It is.",client
6,14,['CQ'],"Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?",therapist
6,15,['N'],"Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but I guess we got to start somewhere.",client
6,16,['GI'],"Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.",therapist
6,17,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
6,18,['OQ'],"So if you were to-to list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those things be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them.",therapist
6,19,['N'],Okay.,client
6,20,['O'],"It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak.",therapist
6,21,['N'],"Okay. Um, okay, that sounds good. As long as I'm not changing anything and we're just kind of putting, um, I guess, pen to paper or something.",client
6,22,['O'],Yep.,therapist
6,23,['N'],"Um, okay, so my asthma.",client
6,24,['SR'],"Okay, so asthma is one.",therapist
6,25,['N'],Yeah.,client
6,26,['OQ'],What else?,therapist
6,27,['S'],"Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's-that's my dog.",client
6,28,['SR'],"So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's—",therapist
6,29,['N'],"Well, he's-- Yeah, he's saying it's a main-- It's a main contributor to my asthma problems.",client
6,30,['O'],Okay.,therapist
6,31,['S'],"Which I don't- I don't- I don't- I don't buy it and I can't just get rid of him like that, but it's something that's there.",client
6,32,['CR'],That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog.,therapist
6,33,['S'],Yeah. The dog has been there before my wife. I know I've had him longer.,client
6,34,"['CQ', 'CR']",Hmm. So that's a huge stress right now?,therapist
6,35,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah, it's- it's a big stress, it's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things. Also, I guess, cutting down these last cigarettes I've been working on.",client
6,36,"['CQ', 'CR', 'NEGO']","Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?",therapist
6,37,['N'],"Um, finances is a problem right now too.",client
6,38,['SR'],"Okay, so money.",therapist
6,39,['N'],"Time, I got to come to all these appointments and I'm taking time off work, which obviously is the money factor, right?",client
6,40,['SR'],"Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time.",therapist
6,41,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
6,42,['CR'],"Um, and some of these things are kind of related to each other I think we're already seeing.",therapist
6,43,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on. And, um, also my drinking, I got to cut down my drinking too.",client
6,44,['OQ'],"Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that that's concerning you?",therapist
6,45,['S'],"No. It's just overwhelming when you see them everything they're, you know?",client
6,46,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?",therapist
6,47,['N'],"I think- I think the thoughts about the dog has been definitely bothering me, that's been one.",client
6,48,['O'],Okay.,therapist
6,49,['C'],"And, um, my-my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two.",client
6,50,['SR'],"Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-",therapist
6,51,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
6,52,['O'],- sounds like. Okay.,therapist
7,0,['OQ'],So I know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how that happened?,therapist
7,1,['N'],"Um, it's really stupid. Uh, I was at a pub crawl last night and you know how pub crawls are. You have a few drinks and then I thought it was a really good idea to catch up with my friends who are, yeah, they're in front of me. So I just like jumped off the stairs of the bus and I was wearing these like stilettos 'cause it was a 90s-themed pub crawl. Anyway, and then I just like fell on my ankle. It was really embarrassing.",client
7,2,"['CR', 'SR']",Sounds like a wild night.,therapist
7,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
7,4,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
7,5,['N'],It was a lot of fun but I didn't do any dancing after that.,client
7,6,['SR'],"No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week.",therapist
7,7,['N'],"Uh, sure, uh, as long as we don't talk too much about like vodka 'cause I'm still, ugh, a little—",client
7,8,['SR'],You're still feeling the effects of-,therapist
7,9,['N'],Yeah.,client
7,10,['CQ'],"-last night, are you?",therapist
7,11,['N'],A little bit.,client
7,12,['O'],"Oh wow, it was-",therapist
7,13,['N'],Yeah.,client
7,14,['CR'],-really a rough night.,therapist
7,15,['S'],"Well, it's normal.",client
7,16,['OQ'],So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?,therapist
7,17,['S'],"Um, well, me and my friends kinda, uh, we party on the weekend and, you know, we're all university students and so it's just normal, um, to have a few drinks.",client
7,18,['CQ'],So a few drinks is nothing new to you?,therapist
7,19,['N'],No.,client
7,20,['CQ'],And what does a few drinks look like? Is that per night? Is it two drinks?,therapist
7,21,['N'],"Um, per night, uh, like if we go out oh, it's a lot. It's like I can drink probably like seven or eight drinks like if I'm going hard. Um, and then, you know, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or two, so.",client
7,22,['CQ'],All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?,therapist
7,23,['S'],No. I-I don't know. It's normal for university students I feel.,client
7,24,['SR'],"Okay, so at this point, you're not too concerned and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are doing?",therapist
7,25,"['N', 'S']",Yeah.,client
7,26,['CQ'],Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?,therapist
7,27,['N'],"Yeah, sure.",client
7,28,['CQ'],I don't know how you're feeling right now but I'm just wondering if we can take a-just a quick glance at this-,therapist
7,29,['N'],Yeah.,client
7,30,['GI'],"-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day.",therapist
7,31,['N'],Oh really?,client
7,32,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
7,33,['N'],Wow.,client
7,34,['OQ'],Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?,therapist
7,35,['N'],"Uh, uh I would say a little over that.",client
7,36,['O'],"Okay, okay.",therapist
7,37,['N'],Especially with midterms coming up.,client
7,38,['CR'],"Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?",therapist
7,39,['N'],Yeah.,client
7,40,['CQ'],"Right, and is that something that has been, you know, a way of coping for a while?",therapist
7,41,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah, I guess.",client
7,42,['CQ'],Okay. Does that concern you at all?,therapist
7,43,['S'],"Um, I mean, the 10 drinks seems like not a lot, uh, for like-for me and like my tolerance.",client
7,44,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
7,45,['N'],I guess I've kind of built it up over the years.,client
7,46,['O'],Okay.,therapist
7,47,['C'],"Um, so that's a little- a little bit, uh, concerning I guess to me.",client
7,48,['CQ'],Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your alcohol use down within the limits?,therapist
7,49,['C'],"Uh, any reason to? Uh, I guess health-health reasons.",client
7,50,['OQ'],Tell me more about that.,therapist
7,51,['C'],"Um, well, I mean, clearly I don't feel good right now. Um, and it's-- I definitely feel more productive when I don't have a hangover. Uh, so I see a benefit.",client
7,52,['SR'],So you can see some advantages to reducing the amount of drinking-,therapist
7,53,['C'],Yeah.,client
7,54,['CQ'],"-um, that you consume during the week?",therapist
7,55,['C'],Yeah,client
7,56,['CQ'],Is this something you would be willing to explore with me a little further at another time maybe when you're feeling a little bit better? Is this something you'd be willing to come back and talk to me about?,therapist
7,57,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, I think when I'm feeling a little- a little better. Maybe when I haven't gone all out the-the night before and sprained my ankle.",client
7,58,"['NEGO', 'OPTI']","I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-",therapist
7,59,['N'],"Okay, okay.",client
7,60,['CQ'],-kind of explore this a little bit further and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. Is that something that we could do?,therapist
7,61,['N'],"Sure. Yeah, just not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles]",client
7,62,['O'],That's okay with me.,therapist
7,63,['N'],Okay.,client
7,64,['O'],Thank you.,therapist
7,65,['N'],Yeah. Sounds good.,client
8,0,['OQ'],"So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?",therapist
8,1,['S'],"Yeah. Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is 'cause my wife thinks I've got a problem with smoking. I've been smoking all my life and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, uh, so that's why I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and—",client
8,2,['CR'],"So, you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon.",therapist
8,3,['N'],"Yeah. That's an understatement. I mean, I'm supposed to be at work right now, too, right? So-",client
8,4,['CR'],"You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and money being here.",therapist
8,5,['S'],"Yeah, yeah. I'm only here because my wife forced me to come, you know. Like this has come to a head six months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit.",client
8,6,['OQ'],"So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?",therapist
8,7,['C'],"Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about second-hand smoke and—",client
8,8,['SR'],"Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read.",therapist
8,9,['N'],"Yeah, I've got to read this. That's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go out and have-- We used to go out and have a cigarette together at the table. Now I have to go outside in this weather, you know, what's that about? And she used to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than now?",client
8,10,['CR'],"So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.",therapist
8,11,['N'],"And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on me, you know what I mean?",client
8,12,['CQ'],"So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?",therapist
8,13,['C'],"Well, the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and the family. Like my dad's 85, he still smokes. I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes I thought of quitting, but I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can-- I don't know if I can quit.",client
8,14,['CR'],"So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter.",therapist
8,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
8,16,"['CQ', 'CR']","You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?",therapist
8,17,['C'],"Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking.",client
8,18,['CR'],I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.,therapist
8,19,['C'],"Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned, like if this keeps going, like.",client
8,20,"['CR', 'NEGO']","So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking.",therapist
8,21,['N'],"So, I can actually do it that way like gradual taber?",client
8,22,['ADVI'],There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.,therapist
8,23,['N'],"I wish my wife could have come today cause she's feels after like, just stop like right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?",client
8,24,['O'],"If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you.",therapist
8,25,['N'],"Okay. I'll have to talk to her as well because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set something up.",client
8,26,['O'],Okay. That sounds good.,therapist
8,27,['N'],All right.,client
8,28,['O'],Thanks for coming in.,therapist
8,29,['N'],Okay. Thanks.,client
11,0,['O'],What else has brought you here?,therapist
11,1,['N'],They found a little bag of weed.,client
11,2,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
11,3,['S'],It's not a lot though.,client
11,4,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
11,5,['S'],It's not like I was gonna sell it or anything. It's like—,client
11,6,['CQ'],Just enough for your own use?,therapist
11,7,['S'],"Yeah, whatever, you know. It's California, no one cares.",client
11,8,['O'],Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.,therapist
11,9,['N'],How long is this gonna take?,client
11,10,"['CQ', 'GI']","Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which certainly it's just the first of-of some sessions that we'll have together over the next six months. It'd be a natural question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?",therapist
11,11,['N'],"I just wanna get whatever I need to get done, done.",client
11,12,['SR'],Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to get this behind you?,therapist
11,13,['N'],Yeah,client
11,14,['OQ'],".Okay, mm-hmm. Well, I'm wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different ideas on an agenda that we could share as we're working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. Would-would this feel like a natural time to-to move towards figuring out where we might go together?",therapist
12,0,['CQ'],"Sarah, I'm so glad you came in for your well-woman exam today. I think we addressed a lot of your concerns. However, I would like to ask you more about your smoking. Would that be okay?",therapist
12,1,['N'],"Yeah, I guess.",client
12,2,['CQ'],Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.,therapist
12,3,['N'],"Yeah, um, normally, I'm smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six.",client
12,4,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?",therapist
12,5,['N'],Yeah.,client
12,6,['CQ'],Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?,therapist
12,7,['N'],"Um, honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so that I- I've been smoking a little bit more.",client
12,8,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?",therapist
12,9,['N'],"Yeah. Um, I have a two-year-old son as I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm normally kinda waiting until he gets to bed.",client
12,10,['CR'],"Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.",therapist
12,11,['O'],"Yeah, exactly. You know, I told you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. I, um, I work full-time and I just started back at night classes. So, you know, all that combined, you know, I enjoy that time to myself in the evening.",therapist
12,12,['SR'],"Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.",therapist
12,13,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
12,14,['CQ'],So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?,therapist
12,15,['N'],"Um, I mean, maybe I'll have like a drink or two.",client
12,16,['CQ'],Okay. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?,therapist
12,17,['N'],"Um, maybe like two max.",client
12,18,"['CQ', 'SR']",Two max. How many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?,therapist
12,19,['N'],"I don't know. I mean, I don't really get why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here, you know, for a regular visit. I-I am not here to talk about my drinking.",client
12,20,"['CQ', 'CR']","No, I understand- I understand. And I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?",therapist
12,21,['N'],"Yeah, I guess.",client
12,22,['GI'],"Okay. Well, we do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain kinds of cancer; colon cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and, um, also pancreatic cancer. It's also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. So that's a lot of information, but I'm-",therapist
12,23,['N'],Yeah.,client
12,24,['OQ'],"-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah.",therapist
12,25,['S'],"Well, I-I'm just kinda surprised because, I mean, I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low.",client
12,26,['CR'],So you're consciously trying to cut back.,therapist
12,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
12,28,['CQ'],"I have a readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to stop smoking. Where do you see yourself on that scale?",therapist
12,29,['N'],"Um, maybe like a five.",client
12,30,"['OQ', 'SR']",About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?,therapist
12,31,['C'],"Well, I mean, you brought up some kinda scary stuff like, you know, cancer risk or other things like that. And you know, being a mother, I-I don't want something to happen to me obviously.",client
12,32,"['OQ', 'SR']","Right. Well, that's a lot of information to think about. So given, the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you're worried about your family and you certainly have goals you want to succeed at, where are you in your consideration to making a change? In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?",therapist
12,33,['C'],"Well, I mean, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a little bit.",client
12,34,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Okay, great. Let's quantify that a little bit. So how many cigarettes would that be?",therapist
12,35,['C'],"Well, right now, if I'm having like five or six, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day.",client
12,36,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?",therapist
12,37,['N'],Yeah. Sure.,client
12,38,['CQ'],"Okay, good. So we can go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as review your plan. Now, would you like some information on smoking cessation?",therapist
12,39,['N'],"Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful.",client
12,40,['GI'],"Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-",therapist
12,41,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
12,42,['CQ'],"-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?",therapist
12,43,['N'],"Well, what-what for exactly?",client
12,44,['GI'],"Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier.",therapist
12,45,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
12,46,['GI'],"You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley.",therapist
12,47,['N'],"I mean, I would like to talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still not sure with the whole drinking thing.",client
12,48,"['CQ', 'GI']","Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?",therapist
12,49,['N'],I don't think so.,client
12,50,['O'],"Okay. Well, it's very nice to meet you. I'll see you in a month.",therapist
12,51,['N'],Okay.,client
13,0,['GI'],"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines.",therapist
13,1,['S'],"Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them.",client
13,2,['OQ'],Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?,therapist
13,3,['S'],"Uh, yeah, well, I was just- I was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, naturally and stuff in their immune systems.",client
13,4,"['CQ', 'CR']","Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?",therapist
13,5,['S'],"Well, yeah. I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune. Right? So.",client
13,6,"['CQ', 'GI', 'SR']","That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?",therapist
13,7,['N'],"Uh, okay.",client
13,8,['GI'],"Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous.",therapist
13,9,['N'],"Wow, I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I've never heard of polio.",client
13,10,"['OQ', 'SR']","Hmm. Some of these things I've mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those things.  Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?",therapist
13,11,['C'],"Uh, I guess it's okay. I mean, I just I want her to be healthy and safe.",client
13,12,['CR'],It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her.,therapist
13,13,['C'],"Yeah, I just want to do what's right.",client
14,0,['SR'],"So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-",therapist
14,1,['C'],"Yeah, I guess so.",client
14,2,['CR'],"-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.",therapist
14,3,['C'],Yeah.,client
14,4,['OQ'],"So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?",therapist
14,5,['N'],"Right now, I'm probably-",client
14,6,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
14,7,['N'],-gonna say a six.,client
14,8,['SR'],A six.,therapist
14,9,['S'],"But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.",client
14,10,['SR'],"Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.",therapist
14,11,['N'],Right?,client
14,12,['CQ'],Okay?,therapist
14,13,['N'],I guess.,client
14,14,"['OQ', 'SR']","So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?",therapist
14,15,['C'],"Because I've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-",client
14,16,['O'],Okay.,therapist
14,17,['C'],-ever since I started becoming conscious of my body.,client
14,18,['O'],Okay.,therapist
14,19,['C'],"Like ever since I started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-",client
14,20,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
14,21,['C'],"-hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.",client
14,22,['O'],Okay.,therapist
14,23,['N'],"And so I'm just sort of like, well, I'm not.",client
14,24,['O'],Okay.,therapist
14,25,['C'],"But I want to be like-- I don't want to be like stick-thin, but I really want to be like really healthy and really active.",client
14,26,['O'],Okay.,therapist
14,27,['C'],"And like be able to look nice, you know.",client
14,28,['O'],"Okay, all right.",therapist
14,29,['C'],I wanna be able to look nice.,client
14,30,['OQ'],"Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?",therapist
14,31,['N'],I don't even really know-,client
14,32,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
14,33,['C'],"-honestly. Like, I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-",client
14,34,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
14,35,['C'],-like this is something that you want- that you've wanted-,client
14,36,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
14,37,['C'],-for years.,client
14,38,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
14,39,['C'],"Like, you can do it. Because like-",client
14,40,['O'],Okay.,therapist
14,41,['C'],I know I can do it. Like I can do anything.,client
14,42,['O'],All right.,therapist
14,43,['C'],I can do anything-,client
14,44,['O'],All right.,therapist
14,45,['S'],-I know that. But it's hard getting to the point where I-,client
14,46,['O'],Okay.,therapist
14,47,['S'],-do something.,client
14,48,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?",therapist
16,0,['CQ'],"So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?",therapist
16,1,['N'],"Oh, it's a nice place. It's close to work. It's good living with a mate.",client
16,2,['ADVI'],"Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.",therapist
16,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
16,4,['OQ'],What's your thinking around that?,therapist
16,5,['C'],"That's the thing, isn't it? I am-- I don't know if it's the best place for me to be if I'm gonna make those changes.",client
16,6,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
16,7,['S'],And Tristan is a good flatmate.,client
16,8,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
16,9,['C'],"I have no-- We're going in different-different directions now. He doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities I have and stuff, and so-- And I can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because I wanna change mine.",client
16,10,['O'],Right.,therapist
16,11,['N'],"I just-- I don't know how keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though.",client
16,12,['OQ'],"Okay. You're good to explore, but I just want to ask you about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- Tristan know about you changing your life? What does he really know about the changes you wanna make?",therapist
16,13,['C'],"I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine.",client
16,14,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
16,15,['N'],He doesn't have kids.,client
16,16,['O'],Right.,therapist
16,17,['N'],"He doesn't-- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a good mate.",client
16,18,['OQ'],"Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?",therapist
16,19,['N'],"The food would be good. Um, I get- I get support with-- my whānau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing- I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be really good.",client
16,20,['OQ'],"In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your whānau and your children, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?",therapist
16,21,['C'],"I don't wanna hang on to freedom if it this- if it means that I lose my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if I move in with family, that they, even if their intentions are good-",client
16,22,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
16,23,['C'],I don't know. I'll do anything to get my kids back.,client
18,0,['CR'],"So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So?",therapist
18,1,['N'],I don't really know what issues I need to sort.,client
18,2,['O'],Sorry?,therapist
18,3,['N'],I don't really know what issues I need to-,client
18,4,['O'],All right.,therapist
18,5,['N'],-sort. It's just a bit of cash.,client
18,6,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
18,7,['N'],So—,client
18,8,['GI'],"So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out.",therapist
18,9,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
18,10,['OQ'],"Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got?",therapist
18,11,['N'],"Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age.",client
18,12,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
18,13,['S'],"Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries.",client
18,14,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
18,15,['S'],It's not an issue.,client
18,16,['OQ'],"Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened?",therapist
18,17,['C'],"Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night.",client
18,18,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
18,19,['C'],"And some nights you do, so.",client
18,20,['OQ'],Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket,therapist
18,21,['N'],"Well, I don't really keep track.",client
18,22,['CQ'],"Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub?",therapist
18,23,['N'],I don't know. A few times a week.,client
18,24,['O'],Yeah. Yeah.,therapist
18,25,['S'],"I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there.",client
18,26,['CR'],That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you.,therapist
18,27,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
18,28,['CQ'],"Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three?",therapist
18,29,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
18,30,['CQ'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense?",therapist
18,31,['N'],"I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink.",client
18,32,['CQ'],Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50?,therapist
18,33,['N'],Yeah.,client
18,34,['GI'],"'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk]",therapist
18,35,['S'],It's the unlucky ones.,client
18,36,['CQ'],"Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue.",therapist
18,37,['N'],Mm.,client
18,38,['OQ'],"And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um—",therapist
18,39,['S'],"A bit of a rush, I suppose.",client
18,40,['GI'],"A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so.",therapist
18,41,['N'],"Yeah, I suppose.",client
18,42,['OQ'],"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling.",therapist
18,43,['S'],"I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know.",client
18,44,['OQ'],"Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff.",therapist
18,45,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
18,46,['OQ'],"Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you?",therapist
18,47,['N'],"Much the same, bunch of party girls.",client
18,48,['OQ'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies?",therapist
18,49,['N'],"Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me.",client
18,50,['CQ'],"Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend?",therapist
18,51,['N'],Sarah.,client
18,52,['OQ'],"Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say?",therapist
18,53,['N'],I don't know.,client
18,54,['OQ'],What would she say about—,therapist
18,55,['N'],We'd just have a laugh.,client
18,56,['OQ'],"Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon?",therapist
18,57,['N'],"Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am.",client
18,58,['CQ'],"Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it?",therapist
18,59,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
18,60,['CQ'],"You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah?",therapist
18,61,['N'],At times.,client
18,62,['OQ'],"At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling?",therapist
18,63,['N'],"I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped.",client
18,64,['O'],Okay.,therapist
18,65,['N'],"But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me.",client
18,66,['CR'],"Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy.",therapist
18,67,['N'],Mm.,client
18,68,['CR'],"Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does.",therapist
18,69,['C'],Mm.,client
18,70,['CQ'],"So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some—",therapist
18,71,['C'],"Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause-",client
18,72,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
18,73,['N'],"-you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so-",client
18,74,['O'],Mm.,therapist
18,75,['N'],-I don't know.,client
18,76,"['GI', 'OQ']","Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that?",therapist
18,77,['C'],"I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing.",client
18,78,"['CQ', 'GI']","Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped.",therapist
18,79,['C'],Yeah.,client
18,80,['OQ'],"Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch?",therapist
18,81,['N'],"I don't know, you tell me.",client
18,82,['OQ'],How about then your-your kind of hunch about that?,therapist
18,83,['N'],"Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so-",client
18,84,['O'],Mm.,therapist
18,85,['N'],"-you know, it did, so I'm here-",client
18,86,['O'],Yeah-,therapist
18,87,['N'],"-so, I suppose—",client
18,88,['CQ'],"-so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day? What are we talking here?",therapist
18,89,['N'],It's a couple of grand or something.,client
18,90,['SR'],"Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah.",therapist
18,91,['N'],"Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for. [chuckles] I worked [unintelligible 00:10:35] and I was getting paid $18 an hour-",client
18,92,['O'],Mm.,therapist
18,93,['N'],"-$25, you do the math. [chuckles] And that's gonna support me?",client
18,94,"['CQ', 'GI', 'SR']","Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together. So, I'm wondering, how open are you to, you know, seeing this situation from lots of different angles?",therapist
18,95,['N'],I don't know. I'm usually an open person. [chuckles],client
18,96,['O'],Yeah? Yeah.,therapist
18,97,['C'],Just provided it will help me deal with it.,client
18,98,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
18,99,['N'],Yeah.,client
18,100,['OQ'],"Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about?",therapist
18,101,['N'],I don't know. I am just usually pretty open with people. It's a bit different here tonight and-,client
18,102,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
18,103,['N'],-just not knowing what to expect then—,client
18,104,"['CR', 'OQ']","Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far?",therapist
18,105,['N'],"I don't know. I suppose I'm saying that the money did add up, and that was enough for me to end up here, so-",client
18,106,['O'],Mm.,therapist
18,107,['N'],-I suppose I'm here for a reason. [chuckles],client
18,108,['CR'],"Yeah. You know, like-- I-- And, some people wouldn't even, sort of, get in the door or wouldn't be as open as you've been today, okay, to an extent, so, you know, like I said, good on you, yeah. You know, being able to-- It's hard to come to a place like this and start to really open up, so, you know, you've just shown that you can do that. Yeah.",therapist
18,109,['N'],I didn't have a choice. [chuckles],client
18,110,['GI'],"Well, you have a choice about what you open up to me about. Absolutely, you have a choice about that, yeah. That coming, being on sentence, no, you don't have a choice about that, um, well, you have a choice, 'cause, I mean, you can choose not to come, and you'll be breached and get to head back to court.",therapist
18,111,['N'],Mm.,client
18,112,['CR'],"Um, but you do have a choice about how you are here when we meet, and what-what we talk about here. So, um, you know, so you do have lots of choices within that. And, my sense is you're, sort of, you know, a young woman who will make some good choices about that 'cause you're not a bad person, and you know that.",therapist
18,113,['N'],Mm.,client
18,114,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
19,0,['SR'],So you're sick of this?,therapist
19,1,['C'],"Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this.",client
19,2,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
19,3,['C'],"Yeah, it's bad. My friends and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change.",client
19,4,['O'],Okay.,therapist
19,5,['C'],I want it.,client
19,6,['SR'],"So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.",therapist
19,7,['C'],Yeah.,client
19,8,['CR'],"But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.",therapist
19,9,['S'],"Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.",client
19,10,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
19,11,['S'],"And, uh, and it's fun.",client
19,12,['SR'],And it's fun.,therapist
19,13,['N'],You know?,client
19,14,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
19,15,['S'],"Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, but—",client
19,16,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
20,0,['GI'],So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.,therapist
20,1,['N'],Okay.,client
20,2,"['CQ', 'GI']","Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.",therapist
20,3,['S'],"Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.",client
20,4,['CR'],You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.,therapist
20,5,['S'],Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.,client
20,6,"['OQ', 'SR']",Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?,therapist
20,7,['C'],"I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.",client
20,8,['CR'],"So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?",therapist
20,9,['S'],"Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.",client
20,10,['OQ'],What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?,therapist
20,11,['N'],"Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.",client
20,12,['CR'],"Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?",therapist
20,13,['S'],"Yeah, exactly.",client
20,14,['OQ'],How were you successful when you quit before?,therapist
20,15,['N'],"I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-",client
20,16,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
20,17,['N'],"-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."" so.",client
20,18,['CR'],Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?,therapist
20,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
20,20,['CR'],But they don't feel as scary to you now?,therapist
20,21,['C'],"No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.",client
20,22,['CR'],You're doing the best you can do.,therapist
20,23,['N'],Yes.,client
20,24,['CR'],Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?,therapist
20,25,['C'],"Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen.",client
20,26,['CR'],It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?,therapist
20,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
20,28,['CQ'],"If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?",therapist
20,29,['S'],"Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.",client
20,30,['OQ'],"Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?",therapist
20,31,['C'],"I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.",client
20,32,['CR'],"Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?",therapist
20,33,['N'],Yeah.,client
20,34,['OQ'],Where do you think we should go from here?,therapist
20,35,['C'],I don't know. I-I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.,client
20,36,['GI'],"Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try.",therapist
20,37,['N'],I don't like medicine.,client
20,38,['GI'],"Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever.",therapist
20,39,['N'],"That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that.",client
20,40,"['CQ', 'CR']",Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.,therapist
20,41,['N'],That would be really nice.,client
20,42,['GI'],"Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.",therapist
20,43,['N'],I would like that. That would be great.,client
20,44,['O'],Great.,therapist
20,45,['N'],Thank you.,client
20,46,['O'],Sure.,therapist
21,0,['O'],"Hi, Laura.",therapist
21,1,['N'],Hi.,client
21,2,['OQ'],"Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.",therapist
21,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,4,['NEGO'],"So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you.",therapist
21,5,['N'],Okay.,client
21,6,['O'],Does that sound okay?,therapist
21,7,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,8,['OQ'],"All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?",therapist
21,9,['N'],"Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school.",client
21,10,['O'],"Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life?",therapist
21,11,['N'],"Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college.",client
21,12,['O'],Hm.,therapist
21,13,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,14,['O'],That's great.,therapist
21,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,16,['OQ'],Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or?,therapist
21,17,['N'],"Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state.",client
21,18,['O'],Oh.,therapist
21,19,['N'],"So, maybe move away for college.",client
21,20,['O'],Cool.,therapist
21,21,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,22,['SR'],"So, kind of keeping your options open.",therapist
21,23,['N'],"Yeah, definitely.",client
21,24,['OQ'],"Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or?",therapist
21,25,['N'],"Yeah, maybe um, pre-law.",client
21,26,['CR'],"Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting.",therapist
21,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,28,['OQ'],"All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun?",therapist
21,29,['N'],"Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or-",client
21,30,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,31,['N'],"-something like that, yeah.",client
21,32,['CR'],You like to have a good time?,therapist
21,33,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,34,['OQ'],"And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or?",therapist
21,35,['N'],"Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends.",client
21,36,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,37,['N'],"So, I'm like normal.",client
21,38,['O'],All right.,therapist
21,39,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,40,"['CQ', 'CR']","That's a good way to be, right?",therapist
21,41,['N'],Yeah. [chuckles],client
21,42,"['OQ', 'SR']","All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now?",therapist
21,43,['N'],"Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay.",client
21,44,['O'],Okay.,therapist
21,45,['N'],Through college.,client
21,46,"['OPTI', 'OQ']","Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?",therapist

21,58,['CR'],"Great. So, being a good friend and-",therapist
21,59,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,60,"['CR', 'OQ']","-having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too.",therapist

All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol?",therapist
21,67,['S'],"Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most.",client
21,68,['OQ'],Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?,therapist
21,69,['N'],"Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not.",client

21,74,['N'],-kinda hold a drink.,client
21,75,['N'],-have one there and pretending to have it.,client

21,83,['S'],Not really much.,client
21,84,['SR'],"So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol?",therapist
21,85,['N'],Yeah.,client

21,87,['N'],"Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house.",client
21,88,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
21,89,['S'],"Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around-",client
21,90,['O'],Hm.,therapist
21,91,['N'],-or something.,client
21,92,['SR'],"So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends.",therapist

21,94,['OQ'],"Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or-",therapist
21,95,['N'],Um—,client
21,96,['CQ'],-or mostly just-just with the kids?,therapist
21,97,['N'],"Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out.",client
21,98,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. And, what about driving?",therapist
21,99,['N'],"Um, like drunk driving?",client
21,100,['CQ'],Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol?,therapist
21,101,['N'],"Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver.",client
21,102,['CR'],"Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you—",therapist
21,103,['N'],"Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so.",client
21,104,"['OQ', 'SR']",Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous?,therapist
21,105,['N'],"Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation.",client
21,106,['CR'],"So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that-",therapist
21,107,['C'],Yeah.,client
21,108,['CQ'],-you're not putting yourself-,therapist
21,109,['N'],"Yeah, definitely.",client

21,121,['N'],So.,client
21,122,['CR'],"So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or?",therapist

21,124,['OQ'],"Okay. Uh, anything else?",therapist
21,125,['S'],"Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much-",client
21,126,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,127,['N'],"So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you.",client
21,128,['OQ'],"Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol?",therapist
21,129,['C'],"Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody.",client
21,130,['SR'],"Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who-",therapist
21,131,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,132,['SR'],-had some consequences-,therapist
21,133,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,134,['CR'],-and decided that's not for you?,therapist
21,135,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,136,['OQ'],"Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of?",therapist
21,137,['S'],"Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just-",client
21,138,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,139,['N'],"-very, like, obnoxious things.",client
21,140,['GI'],"Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal-",therapist
21,141,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,142,"['GI', 'OQ']","-and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life.",therapist
21,143,['S'],"Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles]",client
21,144,['O'],"Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're—",therapist
21,145,['S'],It's just there.,client
21,146,"['OQ', 'SR']","It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that?",therapist
21,147,['N'],"Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone-",client
21,148,['O'],Okay.,therapist
21,149,['S'],"-alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved.",client
21,150,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?",therapist
21,151,['N'],Yeah.,client
21,152,"['CR', 'OQ']","And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or?",therapist
21,153,['S'],"I guess, I mean, since it's just there.",client
21,154,['O'],Okay.,therapist
21,155,['N'],So-,client
21,156,['O'],Got it.,therapist
21,157,['S'],-it ties in with the whole belonging thing.,client
21,158,['OQ'],"Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?",therapist
21,159,['C'],"Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any-",client
21,160,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,161,['C'],"-in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So.",client
21,162,['OQ'],Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?,therapist
21,163,['C'],"I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that.",client
21,164,"['CQ', 'CR']","Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?",therapist
21,165,['C'],"Yeah, definitely.",client
21,166,['OQ'],"Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?",therapist
21,167,['C'],"Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so-",client
21,168,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,169,['C'],"-maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon.",client
21,170,['SR'],"Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on-",therapist
21,171,['C'],"Yeah, definitely.",client
21,172,['SR'],-your drinking eventually?,therapist
21,173,['C'],For sure.,client
21,174,['OQ'],How might that go?,therapist
21,175,['C'],"Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything.",client
21,176,['SR'],"Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or—",therapist
21,177,['C'],"Definitely, yeah. That's a good word.",client
21,178,['OQ'],"Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing.",therapist
21,179,['N'],Maybe a five or six.,client
21,180,['OQ'],And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?,therapist
21,181,['C'],"Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.",client
21,182,['SR'],"Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something.",therapist
21,183,['C'],"Yeah, yeah. Definitely.",client
21,184,['OQ'],"Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?",therapist
21,185,['C'],"Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se.",client
21,186,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,187,['C'],"I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me.",client
21,188,['OQ'],"So, what number do you think you'd say?",therapist
21,189,['N'],"Um, on a scale of 1 to 10-",client
21,190,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,191,['N'],-if I can quit or not?,client
21,192,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
21,193,['C'],Maybe like an 8 or 9.,client
21,194,['OQ'],"Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?",therapist
21,195,['C'],"Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult",client
21,196,['SR'],"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-",therapist
21,197,['C'],Yes.,client
21,198,"['OQ', 'SR']","-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today?",therapist
21,199,['C'],"Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all.",client
21,200,['CQ'],"Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?",therapist
21,201,['C'],"Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring.",client
21,202,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
21,203,['N'],It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well.,client
21,204,['O'],Okay.,therapist
21,205,['C'],"So, I could just tell them, ""Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.""",client
21,206,['OQ'],What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?,therapist
21,207,['C'],"Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.",client
21,208,['OQ'],Uh-huh. Anything else?,therapist
21,209,['C'],"Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health.",client
21,210,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
21,211,['C'],"So, that would be one.",client
21,212,['CR'],"Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes.",therapist
21,213,['C'],Yeah.,client
21,214,['CQ'],Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?,therapist
21,215,['N'],"Yeah, that would be okay.",client
21,216,['SR'],"All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-",therapist
21,217,['C'],Yeah.,client
21,218,['SR'],"-having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.",therapist
21,219,['C'],Right.,client
21,220,['OQ'],"Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?",therapist
21,221,['C'],"Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?",client
21,222,['GI'],"Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-",therapist
21,223,['C'],"Okay, yeah.",client
21,224,['ADVI'],"-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say-",therapist
21,225,['N'],Oh okay.,client
21,226,['ADVI'],"-without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand-",therapist
21,227,['C'],"Yeah, that's a good idea.",client
21,228,"['CQ', 'GI']","-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?",therapist
21,229,['C'],"Yeah, for sure.",client
21,230,['CQ'],"Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to-",therapist
21,231,['N'],I mean-,client
21,232,['O'],-to stop drinking.,therapist
21,233,['C'],-I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me.,client
21,234,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
21,235,['N'],So.,client
21,236,['CQ'],Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that?,therapist
21,237,['C'],"Yeah. I mean, at least my closest friends, for sure.",client
21,238,['OQ'],"Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can help with?",therapist
21,239,['N'],"No. No, I think I'm okay.",client
21,240,['SR'],"Okay. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-",therapist
21,241,['C'],Okay.,client
21,242,['O'],"-and then, um, if things are going great, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together.",therapist
21,243,['N'],"Okay, great. Thanks.",client
21,244,['CQ'],That sound okay?,therapist
21,245,['C'],Yeah.,client
21,246,['O'],All right. Thanks so much.,therapist
21,247,['N'],No problem.,client
22,0,['CQ'],"You did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what I wanted to go over with you today. I wanted to hear about your values and just talk to you a little bit more about that. Do-do you wanna tell me what some of your top five values are?",therapist
22,1,['N'],"Yes, um, my top value is family happiness, um, that's-",client
22,2,['CQ'],That's number one?,therapist
22,3,['N'],"-that's number one to me, especially now. I usually do this values clarification sheet, like, every two to three months-",client
22,4,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,5,['N'],"-just to see if anything changed, and every time it has changed.",client
22,6,['CQ'],"Oh. So, right now family value is the most important thing to you?",therapist
22,7,['N'],Yes.,client
22,8,['CQ'],Family happiness?,therapist
22,9,['N'],"Yes, it's the most important because it's a little lacking, so I know that that's something that is very important to me.",client
22,10,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",Okay. Would you like to talk more about that?,therapist
22,11,['N'],"Yeah. Um, I can just pretty much say that my family hasn't been on one accord, so, like, if-- I feel like if we all just can fall in the middle, which I know everybody doesn't really follow that track. So, um, I think for my part, 'cause I can't change anybody, is to be more present and, um, just listen and understand my family members, and-and be able to voice what I feel as far as how important family happiness-happiness is to me.",client
22,12,['CR'],"Mm. Because even though it's important to you, maybe they don't know it's important to you.",therapist
22,13,['N'],Yes.,client
22,14,['CQ'],Is that what you're saying? Yes?,therapist
22,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
22,16,['CQ'],And you want them to know?,therapist
22,17,['N'],"And I want them to know how important it is to me, especially now, and I do this, like I said, every two to three months just to see where I am.",client
22,18,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
22,19,['N'],"And, um, these definitely are different from-",client
22,20,['O'],Okay.,therapist
22,21,['N'],-what I usually pick.,client
22,22,['O'],Okay.,therapist
22,23,['N'],"Um, and then the second one I said is religion. Um, it was number one at first, um, but somehow with a big situation that happened in my family you kind of lose sight of your faith a little bit, which is normal. And not a lot of people-- They, uh-- Well, in my church home, i-it just seems like, ""Oh, you lost touch of God, oh my gosh, you're the devil.""",client
22,24,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
22,25,['N'],"You know? And it's kind of like, well we all face those challenges every day, we're not perfect, you know? And I feel like my faith is still there but it's-- You know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters.",client
22,26,['CR'],"Right. So, right now, it really is important to you to put the family values first? And religion is still very important to you, but you feel like maybe you're losing faith a little bit?",therapist
22,27,['N'],"Yeah. I lost faith, and so I'm not afraid to say it.",client
22,28,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
22,29,['N'],You know? And once you say [unintelligible 00:03:12] people that don't really feel like that's—,client
22,30,['CR'],Because you know that other people experience it too.,therapist
22,31,['N'],"Yeah, I know that.",client
22,32,['CR'],"So, you know it's normal.",therapist
22,33,['N'],I know that it's normal.,client
22,34,['CR'],But sometimes it's not something that people talk about.,therapist
22,35,['N'],"Yeah, well, it's a—",client
22,36,['SR'],Especially in the church.,therapist
22,37,['N'],"Yeah, it's like a shock to them when you say something like that. And it's like, ""Well, we all go through things where we're just not sure, and--"" I still have a little bit, I'm not saying that I'm off track, you know? I still have a little bit to go on. And the little bit that I do have are the positive things in my life that I look at and I'm like, ""Okay, well, I'm not in this situation, so I'm thankful,"" and-",client
22,38,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,39,['N'],"-you know, I'd still have faith to keep going on, but sometimes you feel as though, ""Where is God?""",client
22,40,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
22,41,['N'],You know?,client
22,42,['CR'],And it sounds like right now you're at a place of acceptance about that also.,therapist
22,43,['N'],Yes.,client
22,44,['CR'],"Uh, that it's okay with you, and you-you know that it's gonna change because that's been your, uh, experience.",therapist
22,45,['N'],Yes.,client
22,46,['SR'],You've done numerous values clarification handouts and every time they're different-,therapist
22,47,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
22,48,['SR'],-so you know that it's going to change.,therapist
22,49,['N'],Yeah.,client
22,50,['CQ'],And you accept that?,therapist
22,51,['N'],"I've accepted that. At first, I was like, ""Whoa,"" I think I was focused too much on the first time I did it-",client
22,52,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,53,['N'],-then the second time that I did it-- I did five of these total-,client
22,54,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,55,['N'],"-but the second time that I did it I was so focused on, ""What did I read about last time?"" You know?",client
22,56,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
22,57,['N'],"So, and I just went ahead and blanked that out and I just went and I-",client
22,58,['O'],Yes.,therapist
22,59,['N'],"-compared and I was like, ""Oh wow.""",client
22,60,['O'],"I really applaud you for being open-minded enough to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, that you don't have to always have it be the same.",therapist

22,65,['N'],"Things do not stay the same. Um, you know, like, you may be here, you're gonna go there, you're gonna go over there, not necessarily saying you're gonna fall down, but your view on life changes the more experience, the more life, every day-",client
22,66,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
22,67,['N'],"-every day your eyes-- Well, to me, my eyes have gotten broader, and broader, and broader. So—",client
22,68,['O'],Right.,therapist
22,69,['N'],"I don't limit myself to change anymore, I just kind of fill it out, and then [unintelligible 00:05:38] I'm like, ""Okay.""",client
22,70,['O'],All right.,therapist
22,71,['N'],"That's cool, so I'll focus more on that, than on the unnecessary stuff in my life.",client
22,72,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Mm-hmm. Do you feel that there are some parts of your life where you'd like to be more in line with your values, or do you feel like you're really on target with them?",therapist
22,73,['N'],"Um, I mentioned before that it was kind of, like, out of place for me, because when I did this one in particular, um, as-as-- I stated that there were-- The other three were important to me, but I haven't focused on it so I'm like, ""Okay, it's important to me,"" so I lost track of that and the other three—",client
22,74,['CQ'],The other three?,therapist
22,75,['N'],"Um, number three was health.",client
22,76,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,77,['N'],"Number four is inner harmony, and number five is security.",client
22,78,['SR'],"Inner harmony, health, and security-",therapist
22,79,['N'],Yes.,client
22,80,['CQ'],-are the other three?,therapist
22,81,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
22,82,['CQ'],And the top two are family happiness and religion?,therapist
22,83,['N'],And religion.,client
22,84,['OQ'],"Okay, and the three- the three other ones, inner harmony-- Let me see if I can remember them. Inner harmony, health and, what was the other one?",therapist
22,85,['N'],Security.,client
22,86,['SR'],Security.,therapist
22,87,['N'],Yeah.,client
22,88,['SR'],"Inner harmony, health, and security.",therapist
22,89,['N'],Yeah.,client
22,90,"['CQ', 'SR']",You feel like you're not really paying as much attention to them as you would want to?,therapist
22,91,['N'],"Yeah, because when I saw it I was like, ""Okay, yeah, that's one, that's one, and that's one.""",client
22,92,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,93,['N'],But—,client
22,94,['CQ'],Is it because a lot of your time is being taken with the first two or?,therapist
22,95,['N'],"A lot of my time is being taken with, um, number one especially-",client
22,96,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,97,['N'],"-and, uh, I learned about the different way of looking at self-esteem.",client
22,98,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,99,['C'],-and I've been definitely esteeming others.,client
22,100,['O'],Uh.,therapist
22,101,['N'],"So, I've had, um, less time to have some inner harmony.",client
22,102,"['CQ', 'CR']","Oh yeah, right. The family has been so much coming first that you have sort of taken a back seat?",therapist
22,103,['N'],Yes.,client
22,104,['CQ'],You're not even on-- Are you on the schedule at all? Meaning of time in a day dedicated? Is most of it going to your family?,therapist
22,105,['N'],"Most of it goes to everything else, but me.",client
22,106,['O'],Okay.,therapist
22,107,['N'],"And, uh, like, I don't even—",client
22,108,['ADVI'],It's gonna be hard to achieve inner harmony-,therapist
22,109,['N'],Yeah.,client
22,110,['ADVI'],-if you're always running around taking care of everybody.,therapist
22,111,['N'],And I feel like inner harmony first comes with sleep. [laughter] I haven't been able to sleep lately.,client
22,112,['O'],Right.,therapist
22,113,['N'],"But, um-",client
22,114,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
22,115,['C'],"-I think that's the first step, but I just, like-- Oh my gosh, I'm just overwhelmed, um, but I would like to gain that back, inner harmony, inner peace-",client
22,116,['O'],Okay.,therapist
22,117,['N'],"-because when I was, you know, 18 I was just so, like, free-spirited, open-minded. I was living life, now that I look at it, as a fairy tale.",client
22,118,['O'],Mm. Mm-hmm.,therapist
22,119,['N'],"And so I got knocked to reality and reality said, ""This is not a fairy tale."" Um, you're now on board. Like—",client
22,120,['O'],Okay.,therapist
22,121,['N'],"And so I felt like, ""This is not about you, you know, this is about everyone else.""",client
22,122,"['CQ', 'CR']","Mm. So, something dramatic happened?",therapist
22,123,['N'],Yeah.,client
22,124,['CR'],That kind of shocked you out of that fairy tale life-,therapist
22,125,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
22,126,"['CQ', 'SR']",-and into a take care of everyone else thing?,therapist
22,127,['N'],Yeah-,client
22,128,['O'],Okay.,therapist
22,129,['N'],"-definitely, and the shock just keeps getting.",client
22,130,['O'],"Okay. Well, I really enjoyed having the time to be able to sit down and talk to you about your values. I hope that it's been helpful to you, and in the future, if I can support even any way in helping some of those other values get a little bit more attention, we can talk about that next time.",therapist
22,131,['N'],Thank you for listening.,client
22,132,['O'],Okay. All right? You're welcome.,therapist
23,0,['O'],"Hi, Hannah. Nice to meet you.",therapist
23,1,['N'],Hi.,client
23,2,['O'],So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.,therapist
23,3,['N'],"Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess it kind of- it kind of started like five, six years ago.",client
23,4,['O'],Okay.,therapist
23,5,['N'],"Um, it kind of escalated a bit. Um, I've just recently moved out, um, from living with my parents. So just made it a bit worse, I think.",client
23,6,['CQ'],Okay. Is this the first time that you've left home?,therapist
23,7,['N'],"Yeah, I am- Yeah. It's the first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay at home, so.",client
23,8,['CR'],Okay. So it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP.,therapist
23,9,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,10,['OQ'],"So how has that, uh, changed things for you?",therapist
23,11,['N'],"Um, don't know, it's kind of, I haven't really told anyone, so, I mean, it's made it like better in sense. I feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like have to do this. I never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense.",client
23,12,['OQ'],Okay. So how do you feel about being here today?,therapist
23,13,['N'],"It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully, it will help.",client
23,14,['SR'],"Okay. So you'd, you're feeling a little bit anxious about today.",therapist
23,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,16,"['CR', 'OQ']","Okay. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. Um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP. So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out?",therapist
23,17,['N'],"Um, I thought that they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose actually a lot worse. So I'm-I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don't really have any friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight by myself, which I always thought I'd like, but I don't actually like it.",client
23,18,['OQ'],Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?,therapist
23,19,['N'],"Um, I mean, I'm-I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of-- It's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, I just tend to just turn it down. So it was kind of making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff.",client
23,20,['CR'],"Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people.",therapist
23,21,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-",client
23,22,['CR'],"So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to.",therapist
23,23,['N'],"Yeah. Um, yeah.",client
23,24,['SR'],So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.,therapist
23,25,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,26,['SR'],So you would have been about 19.,therapist
23,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,28,['OQ'],And what was happening around that time?,therapist
23,29,['N'],"Uh, I guess I'd finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when I- like my friends went to university, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there.I just stop going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it. I've- I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing, you know, but—",client
23,30,['OQ'],What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?,therapist
23,31,['N'],"I guess when it- I have to kind of be working with other people. Um, I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if I'm like taking places with people that I don't know, I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean, I want to do them, but just is scary. So I just don't do it.",client
23,32,['OQ'],"So I guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your head?",therapist
23,33,['N'],"Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just an idiot. And I mean, they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and-- I mean, I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other people.",client
23,34,"['CR', 'OQ']","Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?",therapist
23,35,['N'],"Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. I should just go home and I just-- I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things and—",client
23,36,['CQ'],Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.,therapist
23,37,['N'],"Um, like a work situation or just--?",client
23,38,['O'],"Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in.",therapist
23,39,['N'],"Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine. I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that. And I guess- they asked me to, um—",client
23,40,['CQ'],It's quite interesting. Was that a fashion shoot or something?,therapist
23,41,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah. It was a fashion thing. I think it was for some kind of-- I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something, but, it was-",client
23,42,['O'],Okay.,therapist
23,43,['N'],"Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really cool, but I find it- found it really hard to try and focus on that 'cause I was so- I was kind of feeling really anxious and—",client
23,44,"['CQ', 'CR']",So it wasn't what you expected?,therapist
23,45,['N'],No. No.,client
23,46,['CQ'],So how long ago was that?,therapist
23,47,['N'],That was two weeks ago.,client
23,48,['SR'],Okay. So it was quite recent.,therapist
23,49,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,50,['OQ'],"So on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation?",therapist
23,51,['N'],"I just felt really- just really kind of hot. I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out. And I was kind of trying really, really hard to just focus, and just, you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything, but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like, when they'd say 'action' and they're trying to get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there and—",client
23,52,['CR'],"I can tell you're getting kind of anxious, even just thinking about that day.",therapist
23,53,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,54,['SR'],"Okay. So you're describing quite a lot there to me. So you're saying that you, you kind of got hot and sweaty, you said that you- you held the camera.",therapist
23,55,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,56,['OQ'],"W-what was, do you mean you kind of try to hide behind it or?",therapist
23,57,['N'],"I was just trying to focus on it. I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly, it would just-- I don't know. I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just focus.",client
23,58,['SR'],So you're holding the camera very tightly.,therapist
23,59,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,60,['OQ'],W-why was that? Why was that helpful?,therapist
23,61,['N'],"Cause I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if I can just-- I don't know. It sounds weird, but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it. 'Cause my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads, like, and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see, and I just thought if I just managed to hold onto it, it wouldn't be as noticeable, but—",client
23,62,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. So, okay. So it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head. Um, you said that you're worried that everyone's looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind?",therapist
23,63,['N'],"Just-- I was just, just stupid and it was just really-- just felt really like kind of- like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I-- Like- I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just, they could tell. And then just thinking of what was she doing?",client
23,64,['OQ'],They could tell what—,therapist
23,65,['N'],I was just really like sweaty and just—,client
23,66,['SR'],"Oh, it was all-all that they could see that-that was-",therapist
23,67,['N'],Yeah.,client
23,68,['O'],Okay.,therapist
23,69,['N'],"Yeah, um, I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers, so they can't tell but, I mean, my hands, like, they were so shaken. I was really red and just was-- Just wishing that I just wasn't there.",client
23,70,['OQ'],"So, I mean, you've already described it to me a little bit, but if you think about how you looked that day, how'd-how'd you say, how'd you think you looked?",therapist
23,71,['N'],"I think just very stupid and, like, I think my face was really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew that I'd- I was probably sweating and shaking, like my hands were definitely really really shaking. Um, and af-- it was, like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely see.",client
23,72,['OQ'],Okay and what-what did you do about-- How did you try and conceal that or hide that?,therapist
23,73,['N'],"Um, well, I again was trying to grip the camera, just look down, just trying not to do anything weird or-- 'Cause, I mean, they could probably tell I was being weird anyway, but hopefully if-- I just- I just tried really hard to just focus and look down, not trying, like not kind-- look at anyone else and just, yeah, just kind of trying get on with it as best as I could, but—",client
23,74,['SR'],So you avoided looking at people. It sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway.,therapist
23,75,['N'],"Yeah, no, I-I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just 'cause otherwise I- I'll just be really sweaty and like, people would definitely be able to see, so.",client
23,76,['OQ'],Okay and how did it end?,therapist
23,77,['N'],"Um, well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so, and then, um, people were going, um, just a-after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it. I'd just- I went home straight away, just got on my car and went home. I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would've seen me being weird and I just wanted to get-get home straight away.",client
23,78,['O'],Okay.,therapist
24,0,['CQ'],"Hey, can I help you?",therapist
24,1,['S'],"Yeah, I hope so. Um, my workplace has just gone smoke-free. I-I'm not-not very happy about it. I'm gonna keep smoking, but I was wondering if there's anything that-that can help me like get through the day. It's like, you know, go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work.",client
24,2,"['CQ', 'SR']","So your workplaces went smoke-free and you're not too pleased, huh?",therapist
24,3,['S'],"No. I'm not gonna quit smoking. I mean, I like it. It helps me relax. So, I mean, I don't see what the big deal is.",client
24,4,['OQ'],Okay. Tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day. It'll help with the—,therapist
24,5,['S'],"I mean, I smoke a little less than a pack a day. It's not too bad. Um, I've probably smoked for the last five years, but I-I-I mean, could quit if I wanted to, but I don't really want to right now.",client
24,6,['CR'],"Okay. So you feel like, right now, smoking's a pretty important part of your life. It's not something you're ready to change, but if the time came when you did decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that.",therapist
24,7,['C'],Sure. I can quit.,client
24,8,['OQ'],Okay. What makes you so confident?,therapist
24,9,['S'],"Well, I mean, I don't see why I couldn't, I-- although I have not ever tried to quit, it's just something that I do for fun, you know, on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work.",client
24,10,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna quit.",therapist
24,11,['S'],"I am probably a two. I-I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today, I- I'm totally not gonna quit smoking.",client
24,12,['OQ'],Okay. What made you say two instead of one?,therapist
24,13,['C'],"Well, I mean, anything's possible. I mean, I-I guess I could maybe be convinced. Yeah. Is there some-- I mean, are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking?",client
24,14,['OPTI'],"Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke.",therapist
24,15,['S'],"Okay. Well, that’s good information. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything today. I just need to know my options, but that's encouraging. If I decided to quit smoking, I-I do have at least tools to help me.",client
24,16,['OQ'],"Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?",therapist
24,17,['S'],"I don't know. I guess if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to like quit with me, that would probably help too, but I-- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future.",client
24,18,['OQ'],"Sure. I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free, if there will be some people at work who planning to quit.",therapist
24,19,['C'],That's a good point. I hadn't really thought about that. That-that's a good idea. Yeah.,client
24,20,['NEGO'],"Okay. Well, it sounds like you're really here just for information today. I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you.",therapist
24,21,['N'],"Okay. Well, thanks a lot.",client
25,0,['OQ'],"So, Liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?",therapist
25,1,['C'],"Um, I really want to start working out again. Definitely wanna get back in it, have a routine, and just be healthy.",client
25,2,['OQ'],"Okay, and-and why would you want to make this change?",therapist
25,3,['C'],"Um, I'm sick of feeling the way I do. I feel kinda sluggish. Especially with the winter coming, I think I want to have more energy.",client
25,4,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
25,5,['C'],"Um, I don't like the way my clothes fit or don't fit me.",client
25,6,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
25,7,['C'],"Just, I don't feel comfortable.",client
25,8,['SR'],"Yeah. So, you're not feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, your clothes fit.",therapist
25,9,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
25,10,['OQ'],"What are some of the reasons why, um, it would be good for you to kinda make this change?",therapist
25,11,['C'],"Um, I know exercise is-- in the past, has always made me feel good. I felt good about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel good. I want to be a good example for my kids. I want them to feel like that's a part of life-",client
25,12,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
25,13,['C'],"-exercising. So, I want-- I really just want to go get back in a routine.",client
25,14,['SR'],"So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?",therapist
25,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
25,16,['OQ'],"So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?",therapist
25,17,['C'],"Um, I don't know. I'd probably have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a good time for me to be able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and I'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, evening, maybe the weekends.",client
25,18,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
25,19,['C'],"Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule.",client
25,20,['SR'],"So, it's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your family routine.",therapist
25,21,['C'],"Right, yeah.",client
25,22,['CQ'],"So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?",therapist

25,24,['OQ'],"Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?",therapist
25,25,['C'],Because I'm really sick of being overweight.,client
25,26,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
25,27,['C'],"Not ha-- I just don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, it's just getting there.",client
25,28,['SR'],"So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're not feeling healthy, and you know that you've got other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them to know that this is gonna be just a part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesn't interfere too much with your family.",therapist
25,29,['N'],"Exactly, yeah.",client
25,30,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","So, knowing this, what do you think you'll do next?",therapist
25,31,['C'],"Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna go for walks or runs, um, maybe look for a gym close to the house so that I know I can go there quickly or maybe that has daycare, um, yeah, maybe I'll just start to look for that, and find ways I can do it first.",client
25,32,['SR'],That's great. It sounds like you've got some options and leads on how- on how to get that done.,therapist
25,33,['N'],Yeah.,client

26,5,['N'],"I don't know. Some of-- One of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. I don't- I don't know what it is. Something about me not making my bed, something about my attitude. I don't know, I just want my call, man.",client
26,6,"['CR', 'OQ']","Okay. yeah, it was weird when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you'd been like, uh, model-model resident, uh, always making their bed, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? It must be pretty hard.",therapist
26,7,['N'],"I just wanna contact my mom, that's it.",client
26,8,"['CR', 'OQ']","Mm-hmm. Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her.

26,9,['N'],My dad's birthday is tomorrow.,client
26,10,['O'],Okay.,therapist
26,11,['N'],And I just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom. That's it.,client
26,12,"['CQ', 'CR', 'GI']","Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in. So is that something might be going on with you?",therapist
28,0,['O'],"Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today.",therapist

28,11,['C'],Right.,client

28,14,['CR'],"Okay. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah.",therapist
28,15,['C'],"Right right, yeah.",client
28,16,['SR'],"So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say—",therapist

28,59,['S'],"-because, um, you know, um, being at my age I'm going through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think, as far as I'm concerned.",client

28,98,"['GI', 'OQ']","You know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of different things.

And-",therapist

28,116,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist

28,121,['S'],"-and a cigarette, um, for me takes five minutes to smoke.",client

29,0,['OQ'],"So you shared that you're, um, here today because you're having some dissatisfaction with your body and your confidence and your mood and your energy. And you're looking for, um, some different patterns to kind of turn things around for yourself. And what I like to do as I get to know clients is-is let them know a little bit about my philosophies, about health and wellbeing. Um, but first, I'd love to hear what are your philosophies about health and wellbeing?",therapist
29,1,['N'],"Um, I definitely, uh, you know, I-I strive to be physically healthy, but I also have in my life seeing how that impacts me mentally. Um, so I think if I'm- if I'm able to do the things that I wanna do and, um, you know, that I'm feeling good about where I'm at mentally, then that's kind of my end goal, always. Um, yeah, so this body dissatisfaction piece has really just kinda thrown a wrench in that and it's been enough of a challenge that I thought I should seek out someone who can really help me through that piece.",client
29,2,['CQ'],"Yeah. Well, I'm so glad that you reached out for help, um, and just know that you're not alone. And-and so, yeah, is that okay if I share a little bit about, um, how I tend to work with clients on that topic?",therapist
29,3,['N'],"Yes, please.",client
29,4,['GI'],"Yeah. Well, um, first of all, I really am passionate about looking at the whole picture, um, physical health and emotional wellbeing and what I found in working with clients in the past is when, um, we make a focus of weight loss, sometimes, uh, physical health improves, but at the cost of emotional wellbeing.",therapist
29,5,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
29,6,['GI'],"Um, many people find that when then- when they are restricting their intake or starting some, uh, ac-activity patterns that are really rigorous, that, um, a piece of their mental health suffers because they start to obsess, um, more than they'd like to be about those things. So, my approach with clients is just a more holistic approach. Looking at certainly some behavior changes that you could make to be more physically active, improve your energy levels.",therapist
29,7,"['GI', 'OQ']","Um, and also look at activities that enhance your mood. We can also take a look at some dietary patterns and see if-if there are ways you could tweak how you're fueling your body throughout the day, but at the same time, sort of letting go of what happens on the scale. Letting go of, um, the final, you know, weight outcome of that, and really focusing instead on healing your relationship with food and also adopting sustainable physical activity patterns. What do you make of all that?",therapist
29,8,['N'],"So, like, for example, having like a-a set out meal plan, um, you know, where I'm eating certain food groups or certain macronutrients, for example, that wouldn't necessarily follow that same approach.",client
29,9,['GI'],"Yeah, I-I found in the past when working with clients that creating a prescriptive meal plan, um, tends to work for a few days, but then clients usually get really tired of the foods on there. Um, and so instead, I'm really more interested in equipping you to learn how to space your meals and snacks out in a way that makes your body feel energized. Um, and then I can also support you, you know, in looking at the grocery shopping patterns and the meal planning patterns that come alongside all of that. Um, so really teaching you how to do more of your own meal planning, um, to fuel your body in a way that gives you energy, but also in a way where you're really still enjoying food.",therapist
29,10,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
29,11,['O'],"Food is meant to be enjoyed, and it's a source of pleasure. So I'd want to help you certainly look for ways to add more fruits and vegetables and-and things that nourish your body, but also look for ways to add pleasure-",therapist
29,12,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
29,13,['O'],-to your meals and snacks.,therapist
29,14,['N'],"Okay, yeah.",client
29,15,['OQ'],Think about all of that.,therapist
29,16,['C'],"Well, I think it makes sense, especially like-like you said, to be sustainable. Um, yeah, I definitely wouldn't wanna try something where I'm going to crash and burn for days in.",client
29,17,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
29,18,['C'],"Um, when you talk about activity and you mentioned like really, um, like rigorous activity types, um, like I go to a gym and I enjoy going to the gym when I was active.",client
29,19,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
29,20,['N'],"Um, would that be kind of against that philosophy too or I guess, can you explain that a bit more?",client
29,21,['O'],"Yeah, I'm all about trying to help you figure out what types of physical activity bring you the most joy because those are the things that you'll make time for.",therapist
29,22,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
29,23,['OPTI'],"So if-if the gym is what brings you the most joy, then we can work with that, but if you, um, start to think about it and discover there other activities that you're more excited to attend and you're more, um, you're looking at rear-rearranging your schedule too because you really want to be there-",therapist
29,24,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
29,25,['OPTI'],"-um, then we can pursue those things. So it's really just about what brings you joy in terms of how you move your body and I'm just here to help you figure that out.",therapist
29,26,['C'],"Cool, so both with the foods and the activity, we would be working to find things that I like to do-",client
29,27,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
29,28,['C'],"-that I could do for longer periods versus more of like you said, the prescriptive approach.",client
29,29,['SR'],"Exactly. Yeah. So helping you find changes that feel sustainable because they bring you both nourishment health, but also pleasure.",therapist
29,30,['C'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, I think that-that all sounds good. Um, you know, I still would want to lose weight.",client
29,31,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
29,32,['N'],"Um, and I know you said weight loss isn't really the goal, so I-",client
29,33,['O'],Sure.,therapist
29,34,['N'],"-I just want to be upfront about that part with me and maybe that changes or maybe it doesn't, but what do you think about that.",client
29,35,['GI'],"Absolutely, I appreciate you sharing that piece with me and you absolutely get to have that desire. And, um, we certainly are bombarded all day long with messages about how a body is supposed to look and so we all, um, certainly have moments of feeling dissatisfied with how our bodies look. And so you're absolutely, um, welcome to hold that and we can have space for that and you can certainly talk about that in these sessions. And I'll check in with you as we're going through the process of behavior change, um, to see how your body confidence is, um, as we talk more.",therapist
29,36,['N'],"Great. Yeah, now that sounds good.",client

30,0,['OQ'],"Hey, Mary. I wanted to bring up to you, um, that your battery died last night. So, can you tell me what happened?",therapist
30,1,['S'],"I don't know, and I still don't wanna charge it.",client

30,3,['S'],"No. I got a lot of stuff to do, I don't need to charge it.",client
30,4,['SR'],"So, it's not really a priority for you right now, to be charging it?",therapist
30,5,['S'],No.,client
30,6,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. Um, and do you understand then the con-consequences of-of what that would be?",therapist
30,7,['S'],I guess so. I don't know. I-I-I honestly don't care what the consequences are.,client
30,8,['CQ'],"Okay. Um, would it be okay if I do share you what will happen if you don't charge your battery.",therapist
30,9,['N'],Sure. I'll listen.,client
30,10,['GI'],"Um, you will be getting violations for that, and then if you get so many violations, I mean, we'd have to write a warrant for your arrest, which is looking more of, um, detention time.",therapist
30,11,['S'],Whatever.,client
30,12,['CQ'],And that's still doesn't seem to bother you.,therapist
30,13,['S'],No. I just-- I don't care.,client
30,14,['O'],Okay.,therapist
30,15,['S'],It really [unintelligible 00:00:58]-- I don't care.,client
30,16,['CQ'],"Um, so I know that you, you know, you know the consequences of it, and yet you're sharing with me it's just not a priority for you at this time.",therapist
30,17,['S'],Nope.,client
30,18,['ADVI'],"Okay. You know, that is your choice. I mean, I-I-I can't make those choices for you, it is something that you decide to do. Um, so with that being said then, these will be the consequences. I'll have to read the-the violation for you.",therapist
30,19,['S'],"Yeah, whatever. I Know you got to do your job, but I don't care.",client
30,20,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, any questions about that? Any questions about kind of the next steps from here?",therapist
30,21,['S'],"I mean, whatever happens happens. I'll deal with it when it happens.",client
30,22,['CQ'],"So, your confidence that you'll be able to deal with possibly going back to detention?",therapist
30,23,['N'],"I mean, I'll just deal with it when it comes.",client
30,24,['OQ'],"Okay, and it sounds like you know that it's probably coming then?",therapist
30,25,['N'],"Yeah, I guess so.",client
30,26,['GI'],"Okay. Well, you know I will be back later. If any questions would arise, we can always talk about that then.

31,5,['S'],"Yeah, that'd be okay, yeah, you know, I'm not so certain I'm even gonna take the medicine cause, you know, he mentioned muscle weakness, uh, you know, I-I know I got high cholesterol, uh, and that I'm running the risk of stroke and heart attack down line but yeah, he mentioned muscle weakness and I've been thinking about that and, uh, you know I'm a truck driver and I got a haul the heavy boxes out of the truck on a dolly, and I can't afford that right now. Just that-that muscle weakness, uh, that-that bothers me.",client
31,6,['CR'],"So-so on the one hand, the doctor talked to you about high cholesterol, down the line possibly causing a stroke or heart attack-",therapist
31,7,['N'],"Oh, yeah.",client
31,8,['CR'],"-and that would be pretty serious. On the other hand, uh, when you found out that this drug might cause muscle weakness, that really alarmed you.",therapist
31,9,['S'],"Yeah, that's the problem, that's what I face now with my job.",client
31,10,['SR'],Especially with your job and-,therapist
31,11,['N'],Yeah.,client
31,12,['CR'],-preventing you from doing your livelihood.,therapist
31,13,['S'],Mm-hmm.,client
31,14,['CQ'],"Okay, um, would you mind if I talk to you, if-if I- if I gave you a little bit of information about the muscle weakness, and you tell me what you think?",therapist
31,15,['N'],That'd be fine.,client
31,16,['GI'],"Okay. The muscle weakness with this drug is very rare, uh, usually doesn't even happen, okay? Uh, if it happens it usually happens within the first month of taking the medicine, you'll notice it in terms of weakness in the arms, uh, or some muscle pain, it's not usual. If this should happen, uh, if you let the doctor or me know right away, we can get you off the medicine, it's completely reversible. It's, the muscle weakness will go away within a couple of days, right.",therapist
31,17,['N'],Oh.,client
31,18,['GI'],"Now, you don't wanna let that go on for months at a time, that's when it can become serious.",therapist
31,19,['N'],Okay.,client
31,20,['O'],"But otherwise, again it's rare, and it's completely reversible if you let us know.",therapist
31,21,['C'],"Well, I guess it doesn't worry me quite as much if it's reversible like that. You know, I was thinking this was gonna be a big-time, but, uh, uh, yeah, I guess, it sounds manageable.",client
31,22,['OQ'],"Okay, and, uh, so talk to me a little bit more about what the doctors told you about-about your risks of stroke or heart attack while you're ta- while you have high cholesterol.",therapist
31,23,['N'],"Oh, he just said that the risks are-are up, I think he called it elevated but, uh, you know, uh, that I'm at a higher risk of having a stroke or a heart attack down the line, uh, you know, that's down the line.",client
31,24,['OQ'],"Okay, well how important would it be for you to-to, uh, do whatever you can to reduce your risks of stroke or heart attack down the line?",therapist
31,25,['C'],"Well, you know, my wife and I wanna retire in about four to five years and we wanna be really active visiting all sorts of places, The Fjords, Norway, things like that so I-I guess having a stroke or a heart attack would really be bad for that so and, you know, we-we-we wanna live our dreams actively.",client
31,26,['GI'],"Yeah, and-and one of the- certainly one of the risks of stroke is paralysis, and if you wanna be active that could be-",therapist
31,27,['N'],Whoa.,client
31,28,['GI'],-really a problem.,therapist
31,29,['C'],"Yeah, no-no we-we wanna able to be very active.",client
31,30,"['GI', 'OQ']","Okay, well this medicine can really help lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack so that five years so now when you do retire you can enjoy it without any disability, uh, what are your thoughts about that?",therapist
31,31,['C'],"Well, uh, I guess that's the-the way to go then cause I-I don't wanna be, you know, crippled by a stroke or a heart attack-",client
31,32,['O'],Sure.,therapist
31,33,['C'],-so take- taking the medicine sounds like the-the end of the game right now.,client
31,34,['GI'],"Mm-hmm, yeah it would, I-I-I think that would, uh, go a long way toward reducing those risks.",therapist
31,35,['N'],Yeah.,client
31,36,['CR'],"Okay, um, so if so where we are right now if I understand is you're feeling more comfortable about the concern about muscle weakness?",therapist
31,37,['C'],Oh yeah.,client
31,38,['CR'],"Uh, you seem fairly committed to taking the medicine to reduce your risk so that you can enjoy your retirement.",therapist
31,39,['C'],Yeah.,client
31,40,['GI'],"Uh, and so at this point, you're gonna get the medication and-",therapist
31,41,['N'],And the medicine can get my cholesterol down?,client
31,42,['O'],"Definitely, can lower your cholesterol to 50%.",therapist
31,43,['N'],"Wow, okay.",client
31,44,['GI'],So it's pretty effective.,therapist
31,45,['C'],"Yeah, I'll take the medicine.",client
31,46,['GI'],"Okay, um, and at some other point we can talk about some other things that you may be able to do including diet, changes in your eating habits, it can lower your cholesterol even more.",therapist
31,47,['N'],Okay.,client
31,48,['O'],Okay?,therapist
31,49,['N'],That'd be fine.,client

34,13,['C'],"-and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.",client

34,15,['N'],"A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.",client

34,22,['CR'],"So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.",therapist
34,23,['C'],Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.,client
34,24,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?",therapist
34,25,['S'],"Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.",client
34,26,['SR'],"So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.",therapist
34,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
34,28,['CR'],And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.,therapist
34,29,['C'],"Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.",client
34,30,['OQ'],"So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.",therapist
34,31,['C'],It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.,client
34,32,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?",therapist
34,33,['S'],"Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.",client
34,34,['CR'],"So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-",therapist
34,35,['S'],"And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.",client

34,40,['CR'],You care about them.,therapist
34,41,['N'],Yeah.,client
34,42,['CR'],"It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—",therapist

34,54,['OQ'],"Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?",therapist
34,55,['C'],"Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.",client
34,56,['CR'],"You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.",therapist
34,57,['S'],"Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am.",client
34,58,['CR'],"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.",therapist

34,64,['CQ'],"When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?",therapist
34,65,['C'],I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.,client
34,66,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?",therapist
34,67,['C'],Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.,client
34,68,['OQ'],"This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?",therapist
34,69,['C'],"I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.",client
34,70,['CQ'],"So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?",therapist

34,75,['C'],"Definitely my parents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently.

34,84,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
34,85,['S'],"And having to talk to those friends, like right now I don't want to do that. It's- it puts them in a weird place.",client
34,86,['CR'],Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.,therapist
34,87,['N'],Yeah.,client
34,88,['CR'],And you don't have equipment.,therapist
34,89,['S'],It feels like I have to lec- I don't wanna have to lecture them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.,client
34,90,['CR'],You're concerned that they're gonna kind of treat you like a child.,therapist
34,91,['N'],My parents or my friends?,client
34,92,['O'],"Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends.",therapist
34,93,['N'],"Yeah, lecture my-- Yeah.",client
34,94,['CR'],You're wondering if they're gonna kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-,therapist
34,95,['S'],"Yeah, and I don't wanna be like that.",client
34,96,['CR'],You just wanna be like peers talking.,therapist
34,97,['N'],Yeah.,client
34,98,['CR'],And you want them to support you.,therapist
34,99,['N'],I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-,client
34,100,['O'],"You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.",therapist
34,101,['C'],"Yeah, like if there's a- if there's a balance between maybe not the paths, but the worlds, if there's a balance between that-",client
34,102,['CR'],Mm. You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds.,therapist
34,103,['N'],Yeah.,client
34,104,['CR'],"I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I don't want the party scene that goes with that.",therapist
34,105,['N'],"Yeah, like I-I know I just can't cut off my friends altogether.",client
34,106,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?",therapist
34,107,['C'],"Um yeah, like I'm so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I completely screwed this up, like, is it already too late?",client
34,108,"['CQ', 'GI', 'SR']","You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point.",therapist
34,109,['C'],"Mm-hmm, I have to do.",client
34,110,['CR'],"Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen.",therapist
34,111,['N'],Yeah.,client
34,112,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?,therapist
34,113,['C'],I don't think so. I think just knowing that it's not too late already is enough kick in the pants to get started.,client
34,114,['CR'],You kind of got a reality check today.,therapist
34,115,['N'],A little bit.,client
34,116,['O'],"You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart.",therapist
35,0,['GI'],"Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.",therapist
35,1,['N'],"Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.",client
35,2,['O'],"Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today.",therapist
35,3,['N'],Thanks for having me.,client
35,4,['OQ'],Yeah. Tell me a little bit about yourself.,therapist
35,5,['C'],"So I am, um, 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.",client
35,6,['SR'],"Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?",therapist
35,7,['C'],"Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating.",client
35,8,['CR'],"Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?",therapist
35,9,['C'],Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.,client
35,10,['OQ'],"Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active.",therapist
35,11,['C'],"Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time.",client
35,12,['CR'],"You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going.",therapist
35,13,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?",client
35,14,"['OQ', 'SR']","So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?",therapist
35,15,['C'],"Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.",client
35,16,['CR'],"Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently.",therapist
35,17,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
35,18,['SR'],I want to be more physically active than I've been.,therapist
35,19,['C'],"Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity.",client
35,20,['SR'],Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.,therapist
35,21,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
35,22,['OQ'],Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?,therapist
35,23,['C'],"Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done.",client
35,24,['CR'],"Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff.",therapist
35,25,['C'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.",client
35,26,['CR'],"Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster.",therapist
35,27,['C'],"Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better.",client
35,28,['OQ'],Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?,therapist
35,29,['C'],"Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it.",client
35,30,['CR'],"Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past.",therapist
35,31,['C'],"Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So that also kind of does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself.",client
35,32,['CR'],"Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself.",therapist
35,33,['C'],Mm-hmm. Yeah.,client
35,34,['O'],Great.,therapist
36,0,['OQ'],Barbara Roberts?,therapist
36,1,['N'],Yes. Morning.,client
36,2,['O'],"Hello, there.",therapist
36,3,['N'],Hello.,client
36,4,['OQ'],"My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you?",therapist
36,5,['N'],"Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you.",client
36,6,['OQ'],"Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?",therapist
36,7,['N'],"Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor.",client
36,8,['OQ'],Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today?,therapist
36,9,['N'],"Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help.",client
36,10,['OQ'],All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?,therapist
36,11,['N'],"Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind.",client
36,12,['SR'],"All right. So, quite a few symptoms there-",therapist
36,13,['N'],Mm.,client
36,14,['O'],- and some of them sound-,therapist
36,15,['N'],Yes.,client
36,16,['SR'],- quite troublesome to you.,therapist
36,17,['N'],Yes.,client
36,18,['OQ'],Okay. And how long has this been going on?,therapist
36,19,['N'],"Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then.",client
36,20,"['OQ', 'SR']",Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?,therapist
36,21,['N'],Yes. Yes.,client
36,22,['OQ'],Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?,therapist
36,23,['N'],"Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning.",client
36,24,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,25,['N'],"Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines-",client
36,26,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,27,['N'],"- for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium.",client
36,28,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,29,['N'],"I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah.",client
36,30,['O'],"Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the-",therapist
36,31,['N'],Hmm.,client
36,32,['O'],- the herbal shop-,therapist
36,33,['N'],Hmm.,client
36,34,['OQ'],- how are you taking them?,therapist
36,35,['N'],"Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day-",client
36,36,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,37,['N'],"- so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and-",client
36,38,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,39,['N'],- other tablets for other things.,client
36,40,['SR'],"So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis-",therapist
36,41,['N'],Hmm.,client
36,42,['O'],- what you're gonna take-,therapist
36,43,['N'],Hmm.,client
36,44,['OQ'],- depending on what your stomach's doing?,therapist
36,45,['N'],Yeah.,client
36,46,['OQ'],Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems?,therapist
36,47,['N'],"Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called?",client
36,48,['O'],A gastroscopy.,therapist
36,49,['N'],That's it. Yes.,client
36,50,['OQ'],You got the tube down-down from the top?,therapist
36,51,['N'],Yes. Yeah.,client
36,52,['O'],Okay.,therapist
36,53,['N'],"Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema.",client
36,54,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,55,['N'],That was very uncomfortable.,client
36,56,['O'],Okay.,therapist
36,57,['N'],"Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything-",client
36,58,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,59,['N'],-and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now-,client
36,60,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,61,['N'],- as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor.,client
36,62,['SR'],Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that.,therapist
36,63,['N'],"Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's-",client
36,64,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,65,['N'],- decided that I've had enough tests.,client
36,66,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,67,['N'],"And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet-",client
36,68,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,69,['N'],- there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.,client
36,70,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,71,['N'],"Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private.",client
36,72,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,73,['N'],I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it.,client
36,74,"['OQ', 'SR']","Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?",therapist
36,75,['N'],"No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure.",client
36,76,['SR'],Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years.,therapist

36,78,['SR'],You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach.,therapist
36,79,['N'],Mm.,client

36,83,['N'],Yeah.,client
36,84,['SR'],Is that- is that about-,therapist
36,85,['N'],"I'd say so, yes.",client
36,86,['SR'],- if I got the story right.,therapist
36,87,['N'],Yes.,client
36,88,['OQ'],"Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life?",therapist
36,89,['N'],"Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work.",client
36,90,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,91,['N'],I just couldn't sit all day comfortably.,client
36,92,['O'],Right.,therapist

36,95,['N'],"Um, I miss that.",client
36,96,['O'],Right.,therapist

36,98,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,99,['N'],To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing.,client
36,100,['SR'],Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.,therapist

36,102,['O'],Right. Okay.,therapist
36,103,['N'],"Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class-",client
36,104,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,105,['N'],"- that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that.",client

36,107,['N'],"Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals.",client

36,114,['SR'],- quite a lot because of these symptoms.,therapist
36,115,['N'],Yes.,client

36,121,['N'],"Well, I potter around the house-",client
36,122,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist

36,126,['O'],They certainly do.,therapist
36,127,['N'],"Um, I read a bit-",client

36,131,['N'],Yeah.,client
36,132,['OQ'],"Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?",therapist
36,133,['N'],"Um, well, last year, um, my son got married-",client
36,134,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,135,['N'],"- and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it.",client
36,136,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,137,['N'],"That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it-",client
36,138,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,139,['N'],- and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding.,client
36,140,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,141,['N'],But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah.,client
36,142,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,143,['N'],That was a good time.,client
36,144,['OQ'],Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then?,therapist
36,145,['N'],I hardly noticed them.,client
36,146,['O'],Right. Okay.,therapist
36,147,['N'],"Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up.",client
36,148,['O'],Right. Right.,therapist
36,149,['N'],Which was good.,client
36,150,['O'],Right. That's interesting.,therapist
36,151,['N'],Mm.,client
36,152,['OQ'],And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad?,therapist
36,153,['N'],"Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment.",client
36,154,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,155,['N'],"It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He-",client

36,157,['N'],"- he travels with his job, and he-",client
36,158,['O'],Right.,therapist

36,160,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
36,161,['N'],"Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say.",client
36,162,"['OQ', 'SR']",Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay.,therapist
36,163,['N'],"Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there.",client
36,164,['O'],Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years.,therapist
36,165,['N'],Mm.,client
36,166,['OQ'],What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you?,therapist

36,171,['N'],Mm.,client
36,172,['OQ'],And what do you think?,therapist
36,173,['N'],"Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain-",client

36,178,['OQ'],And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it?,therapist
36,179,['N'],"Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up-",client
36,180,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,181,['N'],"- in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then-",client

36,189,['N'],- the-the doctor didn't investigate.,client

36,191,['N'],"But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football-",client
36,192,['O'],"Oh, dear.",therapist
36,193,['N'],- and it was- it was too late to operate then.,client
36,194,['O'],Right. Right.,therapist
36,195,['N'],"So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on.",client
36,196,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,197,['N'],"And, uh, yeah, I worry about that.",client
36,198,"['OQ', 'SR']","So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night?",therapist
36,199,['N'],"Oh, yes.",client
36,200,"['OQ', 'SR']",To see if you can feel anything?,therapist
36,201,['N'],Yes.,client

36,205,['N'],Mm.,client

36,210,['SR'],"- some prescribed, some-",therapist
36,211,['N'],Mm.,client
36,212,['SR'],- from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations-,therapist
36,213,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
36,214,['SR'],"- but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a-",therapist

36,216,['SR'],- a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the-,therapist
36,217,['N'],Yes.,client
36,218,['SR'],- story right?,therapist
36,219,['N'],Yes. Yeah.,client
36,220,['O'],Okay.,therapist
36,221,['N'],I'd say so.,client
36,222,['OQ'],"Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?",therapist
36,223,['N'],"Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here-",client
36,224,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
36,225,['N'],"- and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem-",client
36,226,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,227,['N'],"- um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments.",client
36,228,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,229,['N'],So perhaps you could send me for some different tests.,client
36,230,"['OQ', 'SR']",Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests?,therapist
36,231,['N'],Mm.,client
36,232,['O'],Okay.,therapist
36,233,['N'],"Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might-",client
36,234,['O'],Right.,therapist
36,235,['N'],- might reveal.,client
36,236,['O'],"Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.",therapist
36,237,['N'],"So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this?",client
36,238,['O'],"Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of-",therapist
36,239,['N'],Mm.,client
36,240,['O'],-your life and causing you a lot-,therapist
36,241,['N'],Mm.,client
36,242,['O'],-of disability.,therapist
36,243,['N'],Mm.,client
36,244,['O'],I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body.,therapist
36,245,['N'],Mm.,client
36,246,['GI'],"Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy-",therapist
36,247,['N'],Mm.,client
36,248,['O'],"- and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less.",therapist
36,249,['N'],Mm.,client
36,250,"['CR', 'OQ']","And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?",therapist
36,251,['S'],"Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain.",client
36,252,['CR'],"Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you-",therapist
36,253,['N'],No.,client
36,254,['O'],- I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.,therapist
36,255,['N'],What-what sort of approach?,client
36,256,['O'],"Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down.",therapist
36,257,['N'],Mm.,client
36,258,['SR'],And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you-,therapist
36,259,['N'],No.,client
36,260,"['OQ', 'SR']",- used to get pleasure out of. Is that right?,therapist
36,261,['N'],"Well, I just can't do them.",client
36,262,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
36,263,['N'],I can't- I can't do them anymore.,client
36,264,['CR'],"Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling-",therapist
36,265,['N'],Mm.,client
36,266,"['CR', 'OQ']",- unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you.,therapist

36,268,['O'],Mm.,therapist
36,269,['N'],I don't know.,client
36,270,"['CR', 'NEGO']","Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up-",therapist
36,271,['N'],Mm.,client
36,272,['NEGO'],"- with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally-",therapist
36,273,['N'],Mm.,client
36,274,['NEGO'],- improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking.,therapist
36,275,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
36,276,['CR'],"And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess.",therapist
36,277,['N'],Hmm. Yeah.,client
36,278,['NEGO'],"What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference?",therapist
36,279,['S'],"Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know.",client

36,281,['S'],They-they left her and-,client
36,282,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist

36,285,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
36,286,['NEGO'],"- in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be-",therapist
36,287,['N'],Mm.,client
36,288,['NEGO'],- pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing.,therapist
36,289,['N'],Mm.,client
36,290,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",How would that sound?,therapist
36,291,['C'],"So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you?",client
36,292,['NEGO'],I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it-,therapist
36,293,['N'],Mm.,client
36,294,['NEGO'],"- and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach.",therapist
36,295,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
36,296,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara?",therapist
36,297,['C'],"Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week.",client
36,298,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
36,299,['C'],And come and see you again-,client
36,300,['O'],Yes.,therapist

36,302,['O'],Yes. I think so.,therapist
36,303,['C'],Okay.,client
36,304,['O'],I think that would be a good- a good start.,therapist
36,305,['C'],All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking.,client
36,306,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
36,307,['C'],I won't bring all the bottles down.,client
36,308,['O'],Okay. All right.,therapist
36,309,['C'],Okay. All right. I'll do that.,client
36,310,['OQ'],"So, shall I see you again next week?",therapist
36,311,['C'],I'll make an appointment for next week. Yes.,client

37,3,['N'],"Yeah, yeah fine.",client
37,4,['OQ'],"All right. So where we left last time, you were going away to think about a few things and to, um, develop some sort of plan of action. How'd it go? What were you up to?",therapist
37,5,['N'],"Actually, it's been pretty good. I, um, I talked to my mom, which, uh-",client
37,6,['O'],Right.,therapist
37,7,['C'],"-which is a big deal. And, uh, she was excellent. Um, I knew she would be. Um, and, uh, I've made an appointment for the, uh, for Stopping Violence and [unintelligible 00:16:15]",client

37,9,['C'],"Um, I've cut down on the drink. I haven't stopped drinking, but, uh-- Yeah, so, uh, it's okay.",client
37,10,['SR'],Things are looking pretty good.,therapist
37,11,['N'],Yeah.,client
37,12,['O'],"So you've rung your mom, had a chat to her.",therapist
37,13,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
37,14,['CQ'],Any other whānau members? You talked about your brothers and sisters last time.,therapist
37,15,['N'],"Uh, I didn't speak to my brothers and sisters this time, I just spoke to my mom, but, uh, she, uh, she suggested that I go and stay with my, uh, auntie and my uncle. Uh—",client

37,23,['C'],"Well, I'm not sure if I want to live with my auntie and uncle. [chuckles] Um, I think, yeah, I'll probably need to. I think probably living with, uh, with my mate in his flat is probably not that helpful.",client
37,24,['OQ'],"Okay. Just sort of interested, when you rang your mom and, um, told her what's happening, how difficult was it to talk about the issue of violence and being violent towards your partner?",therapist
37,25,['C'],"It was terrible. It was really hard. Uh, I think probably the hardest person to talk to about it, my mom. My, um, my old man, um-- Yeah, it was hard.",client
37,26,"['CQ', 'SR']","We-we talked about, uh, last time that this is hard stuff and that, um, we are prepared to kind of do the hard yard. So you've gone away, you've talked to your folks, put it out there about your issue of violence? Um, I'm thinking about, uh, with-with Tristan and the whole alcohol issue there. So it sounds like to me if you've- you've started to put quite a bit of stuff in place.",therapist
37,27,['N'],I try.,client
37,28,['OQ'],"Yeah. What does it tell me about you as a man, as a father, as someone who wants to get moving?",therapist
37,29,['C'],"Well, I hope it tells you that, um, that I'm a good bloke. That I'm a good dad. That I really- that I'm really serious. I am really serious.",client
37,30,['CQ'],"Grand. You talked a little bit about, uh, you'd really like to get back with Kristie?",therapist
37,31,['N'],Yeah.,client
37,32,['CQ'],And-and-and your kids and developing that whānau. Have you had an opportunity to get in touch with her and—,therapist
37,33,['N'],"Uh, yeah, I talked to her about it. We talked a little bit. Um, and she's not completely convinced.",client
37,34,['O'],Right.,therapist
37,35,['C'],"Um, but we'll see how it goes.",client
37,36,['OQ'],"Okay. So what do you think you're gonna need to do to show her and others, uh, to convince them that you are serious?",therapist
37,37,['C'],"I need to, um, I need to see all these things that I've started to put into action, I need to see them through to the end.",client
37,38,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
37,39,['C'],"Well. I need to- I need to, uh, to show her that she can trust me. That I'm serious about it.",client
37,40,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
38,0,['OQ'],"Hi, Sarah, it's great to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you mind filling me in a little bit about that?",therapist
38,1,['S'],"Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and I ge-I guess she's worried with how much I'm smoking and drinking right now. I mean, I-I did agree I would work on the smoking and try to cut back on that. But, as far as the drinking, I-I don't really think I drink that much.",client
38,2,['CR'],"So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about your drinking.",therapist
38,3,['S'],"Right, I mean, I don't drink that much and, honestly, it-it's just a good way to relax.",client
38,4,['CR'],It's a nice sort of form of stress relief.,therapist
38,5,['S'],"Yeah, exactly. You know, it's kind of like that me time at the end of the day.",client
38,6,['CR'],Sort of escape from your hectic schedule.,therapist
38,7,['S'],"Yeah. You know, I have a two-year-old son, and then, I work full-time. And, I also started going back to school. So, you know, just trying to juggle all that stuff. You know, it's tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the day, I just- I wanna relax and enjoy myself.",client
38,8,"['CQ', 'SR']","So, you're working, and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?",therapist
38,9,['N'],"Yeah, and for work, you know, I'm a server. So, I'm on my feet all day, you know, and it's-it's really tiring.",client
38,10,['CR'],It's pretty exhausting work.,therapist
38,11,['N'],"Yeah, you know, it's hard trying to please customers all day. And then, at the same time, I'm-I'm worrying, am I making enough money to support my son, you know?",client
38,12,['CR'],"So, you're not only doing really tiring work and going to school, but you're also worrying about your finances.",therapist
38,13,['N'],"Yeah, and then, you know, with going back to school, you know, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything. So, you know, i-it's just a lot right now.",client
38,14,['CR'],"Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.",therapist
38,15,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
38,16,['OQ'],"So, tell me a little bit more about your drinking. Tell me a little bit about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern.",therapist
38,17,['S'],"Well, that's the thing. I-I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don't drink that much, you know. I've-I've gone up to maybe two drinks a day max, you know.",client
38,18,"['OQ', 'SR']","So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?",therapist
38,19,['N'],Not much.,client
38,20,['CQ'],"Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?",therapist
38,21,['N'],Sure.,client
38,22,"['GI', 'OQ']","Okay. Well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. Like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological problems. I don't know what you think about all that?",therapist
38,23,['S'],"I don't know, i-it just surprises me because, I mean, two drinks a day, that-that doesn't seem like a problem or risky, you know. And, I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them. So, i-it just surprises me.",client
38,24,['CR'],"It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family.",therapist
38,25,['S'],"No. And then, I don't know, I-I'm just getting kind of annoyed, honestly, because, you know, I did agree I would try to work on my smoking, you know. But, with this whole drinking thing, it's like everything that I enjoy, you know, is being taken away from me right now. And so, if I give up drinking, like, what am I going to have to enjoy myself, you know.",client
38,26,['CR'],"Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward.",therapist
38,27,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
38,28,['CQ'],"And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit over time?",therapist
38,29,['N'],"Yeah, I mean, I guess it has. Probably just with being so stressed out every day, you know. I mean, I'm in my second semester of school right now, and so, adding that to everything, uh, it's a lot. And, you know, I'm trying to figure out child carry. Um, normally, my mom will watch my son, but, lately, she can't always. And so, I'm always kind of worrying like, will she be able to, you know. So, i-it's just stressful.",client
38,30,['CR'],"Yeah, and so it sounds like you've noticed that the more stressed you're feeling, the more you're drinking.",therapist
38,31,['N'],"Yeah, I-I guess that's right.",client
38,32,['CR'],"So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-",therapist
38,33,['N'],Uh-huh.,client
38,34,['CR'],"-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. And also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.",therapist
38,35,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,36,['CQ'],"So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?",therapist
38,37,['C'],"No. I guess, you know, the one- the one thing I can think of is, I mean, there will be evenings when I just kind of want to get my son to bed a little earlier, just so that I can have that alone time to unwind, you know, maybe-maybe smoke, have a couple drinks. Um, but, I do feel guilty about that sometimes, because, I should enjoy spending time with my son, but, instead, you know, I'm just wanting to be by myself and relax, you know. So—",client
38,38,['CR'],"So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a little bit in the evenings.",therapist
38,39,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,40,"['CQ', 'CR']",And it's perhaps taking you away from things that are more important to you?,therapist
38,41,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,42,"['CQ', 'CR']",And it doesn't feel good?,therapist
38,43,['N'],No.,client
38,44,['CR'],"Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are, perhaps, more important.",therapist
38,45,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,46,['CR'],And you've perhaps never seen it in that light before.,therapist
38,47,['C'],"No. And, i-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it like this. And, so, you know, I-I do feel kind of worried.",client
38,48,['CR'],I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change.,therapist
38,49,['N'],"Yeah. I mean, i-it's part of my routine right now, and, you know, I-I don't want to sacrifice something I enjoy, but, you know, I'm trying really hard, you know, to be a good mom. I'm-I'm trying to, you know, go-go back to school. I'm trying to work. So, I don't know how I can do all of that if I don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax, you know?",client
38,50,['CR'],"So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now.",therapist
38,51,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,52,['CR'],"But on the other hand, it does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with.",therapist
38,53,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,54,['OQ'],"So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much.",therapist
38,55,['C'],"Well, you know, if there was some way that I could relieve some of my stress, I think I would feel better, and, you know, maybe at night, I wouldn't feel like I had to unwind in the same way.",client
38,56,"['CR', 'OQ']","So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?",therapist
38,57,['N'],"Um, you know, probably my biggest problem is just childcare. You know, my mom normally watches my son, but she's been kind of backing out lately. And so, I'm worrying, am I going to have to call into work today, am-am I going to have to miss class? You know, so, you know, worrying about that really stresses me out, you know.",client
38,58,['CR'],"So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.",therapist
38,59,['N'],"Yeah, definitely.",client
38,60,['CR'],"And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.",therapist
38,61,['N'],"Yeah. I mean, she watches him so much. I think she's just probably getting stressed out too. And, I feel bad because, you know, it's not her son, so i-it shouldn't be her problem, but, I need something that I can rely on better.",client
38,62,['CR'],"So, one thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much.",therapist
38,63,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,64,['OQ'],Anything else?,therapist
38,65,['N'],"Well, I mean, most of my problems always go back to money. You know, i-if I had more money, I could afford daycare, I could work less hours, you know? So, yeah. It's-it's normally related to money.",client
38,66,"['CR', 'OQ']","Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with everything.",therapist
38,67,['OQ'],"Um, we started off talking about how your drinking has sort of drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, but it sounds like you feel like that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to do. But on the other hand, we've talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that or pursue that right now. I'm just kind of wondering where you are.",therapist
38,68,['C'],"Yeah. I mean, I'm ready to consider changing my drinking, but, as far as actually doing it, I-I don't know. I mean, I have a lot of problems that I'm trying to work out right now.",client
38,69,['OQ'],"So, um, it would perhaps be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?",therapist
38,70,['N'],"Childcare, probably.",client
38,71,"['CQ', 'CR']","Okay. Yeah. It sounds like from everything you're saying, that keeps coming up as one of the main issues. Um, so there may be some resources I can point you towards, but I'm- guess I'm wondering, have you looked into alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?",therapist
38,72,['N'],"Not really. I mean, I just normally see if my mom can watch my son, so, you know, I haven't really looked around.",client
38,73,['CQ'],"Okay. Well, one thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?",therapist
38,74,['N'],"Yeah, definitely.",client
38,75,['O'],"Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-",therapist
38,76,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
38,77,['OQ'],"-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?",therapist
38,78,['N'],"Yeah, I-I think I would. I mean, it's-it's been nice to just talk about everything that's going on.",client
38,79,['O'],"Yeah. So, these are not problems that are going to go away in a week. It's going to take some time to resolve. Okay, great. So, um, it sounds like we have a couple of things, uh, to pursue.",therapist
38,80,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
38,81,['OQ'],Anything-anything else?,therapist
38,82,['N'],Mm-mm,client
38,83,['CQ'],Would you be interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?,therapist
38,84,['C'],"Well, I mean, I could at least try to going back to one drink a night instead of two.",client
38,85,['CR'],Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes.,therapist
38,86,['C'],"Yeah. I mean, I-I don't know how it's going to go, especially with trying to cut back on smoking already, but, I mean, I can try.",client
38,87,['SR'],"Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways.",therapist
38,88,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,89,['OQ'],"Okay. So, it sounds like we have two avenues to pursue, anything else?",therapist
38,90,['N'],I don't think so.,client
38,91,['CQ'],"Okay. Well, that sounds good. So, why don't we meet again in a couple of weeks and you kind of update me on how cutting back on your drinking has gone, and also, what it was like when you met with a social worker? Sound good?",therapist
38,92,['N'],Yeah.,client
38,93,['O'],"Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time.",therapist
38,94,['N'],Okay. Thanks.,client
39,0,['CQ'],"Um, so you've talked a bit about like the emphysema. Um, what did the doctors say to you when you were diagnosed? I mean the obvious, right?",therapist
39,1,['N'],"Every time I go-- Excuse me. -to any doctor, you know, you need to quit smoking and—",client
39,2,['CR'],Mm-hmm. Finger comes out.,therapist
39,3,['S'],"Uh-huh and I kind of go, let's move on, you know because I've heard the lecture. Um, and I really don't put much credence into what they say. I did have- I did have a neighbor who was smoked for many, many years and, um, she had the Oxygen-- Oxygen tank that she would have to sleep at night with the oxygen on and even that didn't deter me from that smoking. I don't really know. It's like, um, a power greater than myself. This is controlling me like this, you know, the angels on this side, the devil's on the other.",client
39,4,['CR'],Mm-hmm. And there was a war going on?,therapist
39,5,['C'],"Mm-hmm, yeah. And common sense somewhere in the middle.",client
39,6,['CR'],"Yeah. Well, and your daughter.",therapist
39,7,['N'],Right.,client
39,8,"['CQ', 'CR']","And the social stigma, because you don't want your daughter to think of you like that, whatever that- that as a smoker, you know. You know there're people who make the assumption and it- it sounds like those are more important to you than the medical things, and who cares why it's important?",therapist
39,9,['N'],Right.,client
39,10,"['OQ', 'SR']",It doesn't matter. So what- what ideas do you have about what might be most helpful for you in quitting smoking?,therapist
39,11,['C'],"Well, you know, I was thinking along the lines of meditation. Um, you know, I- I do practice yoga, um, not consistently, but on and off. Um, and when I was in the hospital, I had to do that breathing apparatus and they didn't want to let me go now, like, you know- you know what, I'm not doing that it's already blurry then to this thing, to see the level, um, some pretty obstinate about it and yet I want to do it, you know?",client
39,12,['SR'],"So that was helpful for you that it's a, um, I can't remember. I know what you're trying to get a little ball.",therapist
39,13,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
39,14,['GI'],It shows you your lung capacity.,therapist
39,15,['N'],Right. Which I barely have any.,client
39,16,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it?",therapist
39,17,['N'],Right- right.,client
39,18,['O'],Okay.,therapist
39,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
39,20,['O'],"So, I don't even know where you can get those. I think—",therapist
39,21,['N'],"Oh, I already have one.",client
39,22,['CQ'],"Oh, you have one?",therapist
39,23,['N'],"Yeah, [laughs].",client
39,24,['O'],"Oh, okay- okay.",therapist
39,25,['N'],It came home with me.,client
39,26,['CQ'],"Oh, did you?",therapist
39,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
39,28,['O'],Okay. All right.,therapist
39,29,['N'],It's stuff that I learnt in class.,client
39,30,['CQ'],"It's so interesting because there's immediate feedback. I mean, that's immediate feedback. Um, so we're- we're talking about quitting or here quitting completely. What thoughts do you have? You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]-",therapist
39,31,['N'],"That'd be great, yeah, please.",client
39,32,['ADVI'],"So, um, since you like meditation so much, it's highly likely that you'd be a great candidate for hypnotherapy.",therapist
39,33,['C'],That's- that's something I'd be really interested in.,client
39,34,['O'],"Yeah, okay.",therapist
39,35,['C'],"Yeah. I mean, I- I, um, I've always liked therapy itself, and I- I've heard, I don't know if it's accurate, but if you have the willingness that is you're ease- more easily hypnotized, I don't know is it true?",client
39,36,['OQ'],"Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you?",therapist
39,37,['N'],"Well, I mean exercise, but really, you know, I have the mindset, you know, like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to get up and I'm going to do this, but I really am not a follow-through type of person with this.",client
39,38,['O'],Okay. Okay.,therapist
39,39,['C'],"Because you know I've never been really athletic. I mean, so it's kind of like, I know that when you substitute something for something else, other than chocolate, which is my best friend too, [laughs].",client
39,40,['SR'],Might become a better friend when you quit.,therapist
39,41,['N'],Yeah.,client
39,42,['CQ'],"Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin?",therapist
39,43,['N'],"You know, I've heard of Welbutrin.",client
39,44,['O'],Okay.,therapist
39,45,['N'],"My girlfriend quit smoking. She quit drinking. She quit doing everything with this Wellbutrin. Now I- I- I am on some medications, like some, like I think that's an antidepressant.",client
39,46,['O'],"Yes, it is.",therapist
39,47,['C'],"Okay. Um, I'd be open to that and then I'm not sure-- I'm not familiar with the other thing that you had suggested. Um, I don't know what that is.",client
39,48,['GI'],"It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them.",therapist
39,49,['GI'],"The other thing is its a slight stimulatory effect and when people go off nicotine which is a stimulant the-they tend to get pretty tired overheard-- you know it's the opposite of however the nicotine makes them feel. And the Wellbutrin kind of with stimul-- you know stimulatory enough. [crosstalk] [unintelligible 00:05:56] And I-- the last I've read, and I've not kept real current about it, but I'm wondering about the-- what your thoughts are if any about the-- any of the nicotine replacements like the gum patch, the inhaler.",therapist
39,50,['S'],"Um, you know I'd be-- I've heard a little bit about them, but I mean I do know some people, but they're not exactly reliable, um, as far as you know really having a desire and sticking to it that they smoke on the patch and-and then it causes this you know extreme, you know? Like you're getting double the nicotine or whatever so it's almost like they're getting a buzz from it you know so that's my fear and the cost of the patch because it's not covered you know through your, um, your- your insurance and the Nicorette same thing it's very expensive you know. And I'm not really a gum sure but here I am because—",client
39,51,['O'],Chewing gum.,therapist
39,52,['C'],"[laughs] but I mean I'd be interested I wish they'd make it more affordable for people or you know they haven't covered by insurance because you know the risk of it you know that the premiums for insurance- insurance for people who smoke are so high you would think that they would have like, um, what do they call that? Preventive. Um, I wish I never would have started and I'm proud of my daughter you know because I started smoking a little bit earlier than her age, and I'm proud that she is at this point not smoking this manifestation she might pick it up but it's- it's like-",client
39,53,['CR'],That strong spirit of you got instilled with her.,therapist
39,54,['C'],"Yeah-yeah, maybe I'm the best example of why she doesn't want to [laughs] you know",client
39,55,['CQ'],Could be?,therapist
39,56,['C'],Whatever you know and her friends. I think a lot of her friend's parents don't smoke and I'm constantly running like outside to smoke and-and-,client
39,57,['CR'],It is becoming a pain in the butt,therapist
39,58,['C'],It is. It really is. It's a monkey on my back,client
39,59,['O'],Mm-hmm,therapist
39,60,['S'],"And um for me smoking is like a calming effect, you know. And some people it's a stimulant you know and then for me, it's like, I look forward to relaxing on my couch after a long day and then watching my you know news or whatever the heck I'm watching or reading and having my cigarette, um, I'll tell you-",client
39,61,['SR'],Like it's a little treat.,therapist
39,62,['S'],"Right. Exactly or you know like I'll do some work, and then I'm like okay you know as my ex-husband says Union break and it's a cigarette break. [laughs]",client
39,63,['O'],I've never heard of Union break. I love it how you said. I love it.,therapist
39,64,['N'],Yeah. Absolutely it's not my quote but he actually he would mind.,client
39,65,['O'],I love it. Union break.,therapist
39,66,['N'],Yeah,client
39,67,['O'],It's great,therapist
39,68,['N'],"Yeah, you know how those union workers have to have you know, Union break.",client
39,69,['GI'],"Union break. Yeah. le-leverage, and you know so it's something else you might know about nicotine is, um is that actually depending on how you smoke it, it can- it can be stimulant when you want it to be a stimulant if you smoke it in short, shallow puffs and then it can be a depressant like after a meal and you take longer inhalations, and it really tends to act on your central nervous system as a depressant. So it kind of does whatever you want at any given moment and yet there is this price that you pay",therapist
39,70,['C'],"Yeah, financially too, which is [inaudible 00:09:27]",client
39,71,['CQ'],"Financially. Right, getting back to the finances and you know, you know, you know I'm thinking your daughter what a pain but it's become the finances the emphysema. I'm really-- because I would think that in 10 years, how much are you smoking now?",therapist
39,72,['N'],"Well, uh",client
40,0,['N'],Pretty good. It's been three months now.,client
40,1,['O'],Nice.,therapist
40,2,['N'],"Um, and—",client
40,3,['CQ'],"Since the-- since you used, uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?",therapist
40,4,['N'],Right.,client
40,5,['O'],Okay.,therapist
40,6,['C'],"Right. It's been three months, and I've been doing pretty well.",client
40,7,['O'],Good.,therapist
40,8,['N'],"Um, and I met a couple new friends.",client
40,9,['O'],Nice.,therapist
40,10,['N'],So—,client
40,11,['SR'],"So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so--",therapist
40,12,['C'],Right.,client
40,13,['OQ'],And how is that going for you?,therapist
40,14,['C'],Right. It's been good. I haven't answered the phone when he's called-,client
40,15,['O'],Okay.,therapist
40,16,['C'],"-and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone. Um, so it's been good for me to just reach out and like, meet a couple of new people, um, in the neigh-neighborhood that I'm living in.",client
40,17,['CR'],"So it sounds like you've made some good changes. The change in your environment, and some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new friends.",therapist
40,18,['C'],"Yeah, the new friends, and I've been using the, you know, the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get-- start to feel a little stressed out, and I've been- I've been using those and it helps me. I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and kind of gets me through that time.",client
40,19,['O'],So it sounds like--,therapist
41,0,['O'],"So, thank you for coming in today.",therapist
41,1,['N'],Yes.,client
41,2,['OQ'],How are you feeling today?,therapist
41,3,['N'],I feel great actually.,client
41,4,['O'],Yeah? Good.,therapist
41,5,['N'],Yeah.,client
41,6,['O'],Good.,therapist
41,7,['N'],I feel good.,client
41,8,['OQ'],"And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-",therapist
41,9,['N'],Yeah.,client
41,10,['OQ'],-and what are your top five?,therapist
41,11,['C'],"Yes. It was a good, uh, experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and, uh, the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one.",client
41,12,['CQ'],Really?,therapist
41,13,['N'],"Yeah. And, um—",client
41,14,['OQ'],Do you have any idea why that is?,therapist
41,15,['C'],"I do have an idea, I think, why that is. Um, I think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family, is that I have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other people first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was, uh, kind of sad in a way, at the time that I realized it. Uh, I didn't realize how severe it actually was, but I was kind of glad that I realized it because I feel like it's never too late to change-",client
41,16,['O'],True.,therapist
41,17,['C'],"-and I feel like I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better person for other people as well.",client
41,18,['CR'],Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much?,therapist
41,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
41,20,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
41,21,['C'],"Because I get stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts.",client
41,22,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
41,23,['C'],And I can't be the best- the best me possible.,client
41,24,['CQ'],For someone else?,therapist
41,25,['C'],Yeah.,client
41,26,['CQ'],For your family?,therapist
41,27,['C'],"For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah.",client
41,28,['CR'],"You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself?",therapist
41,29,['C'],"I-it's almost-- Like, I think that some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other people think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values dictate my actions, I was letting what I thought other people wanted me to do to dictate my actions.",client
41,30,['O'],Wow.,therapist
41,31,['C'],"And that's something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing it.",client
41,32,['CR'],There's so much of your-- Part of your paradigm?,therapist
41,33,['C'],"Yes, yes.",client
41,34,['OQ'],"So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware",therapist
41,35,['C'],"Not aware at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt-- I feel like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parent, and I could give myself the things that weren't given to me, now. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself an opinion. I can live like that, if I want to. Nobody's stopping me from it, only me.",client
41,36,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
41,37,['C'],"So, that's what I want to do.",client
41,38,['C'],Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty for saying that.,client
41,39,['CQ'],The very first time that you can remember?,therapist
41,40,['C'],"I would say so, yeah. I don't know if I've ever said that in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles]",client
41,41,['SR'],That's not a selfish thing.,therapist
41,42,['N'],No-,client
41,43,['O'],Right.,therapist
41,44,['C'],"-it's not, it's really not.",client
41,45,['O'],"Cool, that's great.",therapist
41,46,['N'],Yeah.,client
41,47,['OQ'],"Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel?",therapist
41,48,['C'],"Well, it makes me feel jubilant. It makes me feel joyful. It makes me feel hopeful. It makes me feel like I count, like I matter. Uh, it makes me feel like I'm going to be able to do what I want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the things that kind of happened along the way I really didn't notice, is that, um-- Like, let's say for example I like being a teacher or I like being a teacher or I like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all the shoulds and all of the sense of responsibility and all of the caring about what people think, I started to lose joy doing things I actually enjoy doing.",client
41,49,['CR'],Because you're- felt so obligated.,therapist
41,50,['C'],"Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really really a sense of like you know passion you know. My passion is gone completely. I don't know I'm just happy to, I feel like I got back in touch with myself. It's like I was like lost for a while and now I'm like back again, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do this or like why this is important to me because it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, uh, balanced.",client
41,51,['CQ'],"Yeah, is that on your top five also",therapist
41,52,['C'],"No, but um, the other ones I have on there, uh are, number two, inner harmony. For the same reason, like I feel like I need to harmonious within myself before I can be harmonious with other people.",client
41,53,['CR'],You get peace with yourself?,therapist
41,54,['C'],"Yes, and then I put family happiness.",client
41,55,['O'],That's very good.,therapist
41,56,['C'],"Yes, because I think that when I'm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. When I am unhappy with myself, I bring my unhappiness to my family.",client
41,57,['O'],Sure.,therapist
41,58,['N'],"Uh, yeah, when I don't have self-respect and I am only giving my family a say on who I am and what I should do, I'm angry at them, I quarrel them.",client
41,59,['CR'],You feel resentful.,therapist
41,60,['C'],"I resent them, I really do, when I am in the mode. But when I just say, ""Hey, I'm a person of this family and I deserve this much time and energy and attention and just more than anybody else,"" I don't care, you do what I do I do what I do life goes on [chuckles].",client
41,61,['O'],Right.,therapist
41,62,['N'],"And then I have health and achievement, and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier like I think I can show up and be a teacher and be a counselor in many different, uh, capacities. I could be your- I could be- I could be a teacher and I could be a really bad teacher. I could still be a teacher you know, I could show up an I could just do a really poor job and I could go home and I probably could keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right?",client
41,63,['O'],Right.,therapist
41,64,['C'],But I don't feel good about that.,client
41,65,['CR'],You don't feel fulfilled.,therapist
41,66,['N'],No.,client
41,67,['SR'],Like you've done anything helpful.,therapist
41,68,['N'],"Right, right.",client
41,69,['SR'],It's because you showed up and you gave out,therapist
41,70,['C'],"It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see it going together with the helping. It's not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or do what I think I should do but to really give something needy, something substantive, something real.",client
41,71,['CR'],Meaningful.,therapist
41,72,['C'],"Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's small.",client
41,73,['SR'],"Sometimes it's the small things that really count, too.",therapist
41,74,['N'],Yeah.,client
41,75,['SR'],"So all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you are right now.",therapist
41,76,['C'],Yeah. Yeah.,client
41,77,['OQ'],That's great and is there anything else on the list you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top five that you had or something similar?,therapist
41,78,['C'],"Well, one of the things about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I have done this list, uh, creativity and freedom have been really high up there. And it didn't even make it to my top five. It was in my top 12.",client
41,79,['O'],Uh-uh.,therapist
41,80,['N'],"But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and self-respect. Part of what- part of what binds me, part of what takes my freedom away is when I just explain all over the place and I don't give any attention to myself. Part of what steals my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in stress and I am not- I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative if you can't even hear yourself?",client
41,81,['SR'],All the chattering.,therapist
41,82,['C'],"Yeah, exactly, to me the creativity comes from the silence, comes from the quiet. It's literally-- I can just be in silence for even if for a few moments. It's amazing the ideas that come to me so quickly and so easily that would take me hours to figure out if I'm stressing.",client
41,83,['O'],Thank you so much for sharing.,therapist
41,84,['C'],"Thank you, thank you for listening.",client
42,0,['N'],"I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off.",client
42,1,['CR'],"Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?",therapist
42,2,['C'],"No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening.",client
42,3,['SR'],"Right. So you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's not showing results on the scale?",therapist
42,4,['N'],Yes.,client
42,5,['CR'],And you're not feeling so good about that?,therapist
42,6,['C'],"No, and even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support in it anyway.",client
42,7,['CR'],"Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?",therapist
42,8,['N'],Yes.,client
42,9,['CR'],At home or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?,therapist
42,10,['N'],"No, and specifically my father, he just-- Not only does he not want to support me with it but at the same time, he feels like I need to be gaining my weight back.",client
42,11,['O'],"Oh, okay.",therapist
42,12,['N'],So I—,client
42,13,['OQ'],Tell me about that.,therapist
42,14,['N'],"It's as though by me losing weight, it's like I'm somehow disconnecting from my family, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to fit into like this perfect American picture and I just want to be healthy, I just want to have a good body and he doesn't think of it that way.",client
43,0,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. So, there is something I'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what's one thing about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?",therapist
43,1,['C'],"Um, well, you know, I have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it. Um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, I don't want to feel that way.",client
43,2,['SR'],"Yeah. This anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam.",therapist
43,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
43,4,['SR'],"And so, it's easier for you to just not do it.",therapist
43,5,['N'],"Exactly. So, I just avoid it and put it off.",client
43,6,['OQ'],"Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?",therapist
43,7,['N'],"Um, maybe like a four or five.",client
43,8,['OQ'],"Okay. So, four or five. How combat, like, not like a two or three.",therapist
43,9,['C'],"I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me.",client
43,10,['SR'],"Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam.",therapist
43,11,['N'],Yeah.,client
43,12,['SR'],And before you've been putting it off.,therapist
43,13,['N'],"Yes. And I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So, um, now I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming.",client
43,14,['SR'],"Okay. So, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it.",therapist
43,15,['N'],Yes.,client
43,16,['OQ'],"And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?",therapist
43,17,['C'],"Um, well I think it's this kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I can figure out, if I don't pass, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and I think about it every single day. And I'm just sick of thinking about it.",client
43,18,['O'],So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.,therapist
43,19,['N'],"Yeah. But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, you know, like people are going to ask me how I did and if I don't pass it I'm gonna have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. Um, so that makes me really anxious.",client
43,20,['SR'],Yeah. You kind of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.,therapist
43,21,['N'],Right.,client
43,22,['OQ'],I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?,therapist
43,23,['N'],"Uh, I would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I did not want to do it. I was trying to find every way that I can get out of during this recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very anxious, um, I think other people don't always believe in me.",client
43,24,['N'],"And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust in myself. And to know that I did a good job.",client
43,25,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
43,26,['N'],"Um, it made me feel good.",client
43,27,['CR'],"So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you really, you liked that feeling.",therapist
43,28,['N'],"Yeah, I did.",client
43,29,['O'],"Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it.",therapist
43,30,['N'],Yeah.,client
43,31,['OQ'],"Um, how do you think you could relate that to what you're dealing with now?",therapist
43,32,['C'],"I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests. And so, um, but that if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a good job like the-- you know, I mean, I would like to have that feeling again.",client
43,33,['O'],Mm-hmm,therapist
43,34,['N'],You know.,client
43,35,['SR'],So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again,therapist
43,36,['N'],Right,client
43,37,['O'],"And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself.",therapist
43,38,['N'],Yeah.,client
43,39,['OQ'],"So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?",therapist
43,40,['C'],"Well, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up a little bit.",client
43,41,['O'],Mm-hmm,therapist
43,42,['C'],"And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can't.",client
43,43,"['CR', 'OQ']",So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?,therapist
43,44,['C'],Yeah. Mm-hmm.,client
43,45,"['OQ', 'SR']","So to summarize, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over the past couple years. Yet, this time around, you seem more confident to just get it done. And you've even mentioned times in the past where you were feeling anxious and you were successful about it and that you felt proud about yourself. And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?",therapist
43,46,['C'],Yeah.,client
43,47,['O'],"Okay. Well, thank you, Tanya.",therapist
43,48,['N'],Thank you.,client
43,49,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
45,0,['OQ'],"Hi, Mary, how was your day?",therapist
45,1,['N'],Fine. Where do you want me to sign?,client
45,2,['CR'],"Well, you can sign right there. Seems like you're not in the mood to talk today.",therapist
45,3,['N'],Not really.,client
45,4,['GI'],"Okay. You know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well.",therapist
45,5,['N'],"Yeah, whatever. I just, yeah.",client
45,6,['CQ'],It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?,therapist
45,7,['N'],"It's just like the same thing every day like, I don't really know why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are asking me all these questions?",client
45,8,['SR'],"So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house.",therapist
45,9,['N'],Yup.,client
45,10,['CQ'],Okay. Would it be okay with you if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?,therapist
45,11,['N'],I guess so.,client
45,12,['GI'],"You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff.",therapist
45,13,['N'],So you just wanna know my business?,client
45,14,['SR'],It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure.,therapist
45,15,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,16,['O'],"I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible.",therapist
45,17,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,18,['GI'],So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.,therapist
45,19,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,20,['CR'],Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.,therapist
45,21,['N'],Yeah. I mean I guess I'll be here if I have to be but I can't make any promises that I won't leave.,client
45,22,['CQ'],So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?,therapist
45,23,['N'],"No, 'cause this just kinda feels like why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?",client
45,24,['CR'],"Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well.",therapist
45,25,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,26,['CR'],I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.,therapist
45,27,['N'],It's just like a lot.,client
45,28,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
45,29,['N'],And you feel like there's all these rules.,client
45,30,['SR'],Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.,therapist
45,31,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,32,['O'],"Um, and I know some clients have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they really valued that until it was gone.",therapist
45,33,['C'],"Right, I think that's the only thing that I wish I had now.",client
45,34,['CQ'],Your freedom?,therapist
45,35,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,36,['OQ'],What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?,therapist
45,37,['C'],I guess like your sign your papers.,client
45,38,['ADVI'],"Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do.",therapist
45,39,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,40,['OQ'],What are some other ways you feel like you can get your freedom back?,therapist
45,41,['C'],Not do this again so that I don't ever have to be here and be stuck in my house and all of these people coming to visit me and know my business.,client
45,42,['CQ'],"So that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you do not like when we stop by?",therapist
45,43,['N'],Yup.,client
45,44,['O'],"That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that.",therapist
45,45,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
45,46,['O'],"Okay. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with me?",therapist
45,47,['N'],Not really.,client
45,48,['GI'],"Okay, well just so you know, again, I do have to come back so I'll see you later today then.",therapist
45,49,['N'],All right.,client
45,50,['O'],All right.,therapist
45,51,['N'],Bye.,client
46,0,['CQ'],"So, Jacob, everything looks very normal on your physical exam. Do you have any questions for me?",therapist
46,1,['N'],No.,client
46,2,['O'],"Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?",therapist
46,3,['N'],Sure.,client
46,4,"['CQ', 'GI']",Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?,therapist
46,5,['N'],Yeah.,client
46,6,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. So, let's take a look. So I see that you have marked that you sometimes use alcohol, and that you have used alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about your alcohol use?",therapist
46,7,['S'],"It's not a big deal. Sometimes with my friends, we'll drink a few beers and when we're hanging out or when we're at a party, and sometimes rum and cokes.",client
46,8,['CQ'],"Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?",therapist
46,9,['S'],"Um, three or four, probably. I don't keep track.",client
46,10,['CQ'],Okay. And how often?,therapist
46,11,['N'],"Um, probably about once or twice a month.",client
46,12,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. So, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?",therapist
46,13,['N'],Probably since last October.,client
46,14,"['OQ', 'SR']","So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?",therapist
46,15,['N'],What do I like about it?,client
46,16,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
46,17,['S'],"Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's house, and we're drinking with other people that we don't know. It tastes good.",client
46,18,['SR'],"Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste.",therapist
46,19,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
46,20,['CQ'],"Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?",therapist
46,21,['C'],"Um, I don't like when I get sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-",client
46,22,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
46,23,['C'],"-when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that.",client
46,24,['CQ'],"Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?",therapist
46,25,['N'],"No, but that happened to someone I know, though.",client
46,26,['CQ'],"Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?",therapist
46,27,['C'],"Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting up.",client
46,28,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
46,29,['C'],"Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover.",client
46,30,['CQ'],Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?,therapist
46,31,['C'],"No, but I got grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles]",client
46,32,['CQ'],"So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?",therapist
46,33,['S'],"Yeah, but I only missed school once.",client
46,34,['GI'],"Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?",therapist
46,35,['N'],Yeah.,client
46,36,['GI'],"That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol.",therapist
46,37,['N'],Okay.,client
46,38,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?",therapist
46,39,['N'],"Um, probably a five.",client
46,40,['OQ'],"A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?",therapist
46,41,['C'],"Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble.",client
46,42,['OQ'],Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into trouble?,therapist
46,43,['C'],"Um, not drink.",client
46,44,['CQ'],[chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?,therapist
46,45,['S'],"No, not really.",client
46,46,['NEGO'],Okay. What some people your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like.,therapist
46,47,['C'],I could probably do that.,client
46,48,['CQ'],"So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?",therapist
46,49,['N'],I don't know.,client
46,50,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",Do you think you could go two months without drinking?,therapist
46,51,['C'],"Yeah, probably.",client
46,52,['OQ'],Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?,therapist
46,53,['C'],"Um, I could probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke.",client
46,54,['CQ'],Anything else to make things easier for you?,therapist
46,55,['C'],I can probably hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or inviting them to parties and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at parties.,client
46,56,['CQ'],"Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?",therapist
46,57,['C'],"Yeah. The-- My friends who don't drink would probably be happy that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd support me.",client
46,58,"['CQ', 'SR']","Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?",therapist
46,59,['N'],Okay.,client
47,0,['OQ'],"Hey, Mary, how are you?",therapist
47,1,['N'],Fine.,client
47,2,"['GI', 'OQ']","Um, I noticed some yelling going on in the house, what's going on?",therapist
47,3,['N'],It's not really any of your business.,client
47,4,['CR'],So nothing you want to talk about right now?,therapist
47,5,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
47,6,['CR'],My guess is you're probably involved in that.,therapist
47,7,['N'],Hmm.,client
47,8,"['CR', 'GI']","Okay, I understand that sometimes if you're feeling angry or upset about something, the last thing you want to do is share with your caseworker at that time, but, um, you know I am here for you, and if there's anything you ever want to talk about or share with me, that is something that I would love to-to here, and I'll just see sit here and listen if that's something that you would find helpful.",therapist
47,9,['N'],Okay.,client
47,10,"['CR', 'OPTI']","Okay. You know what? I-it seems like things have been really a struggle for you lately, and I have noticed that you haven't been in the best mood, so I'm really- I am concerned about you, but again, it's your choice if that's something that you feel like you want to share with me.",therapist
47,11,['N'],Okay.,client
47,12,['GI'],"All right, well, you know I will be by later today. If, um, you have any questions or if you want to talk, um, otherwise, again, I'll stop by and call you later.",therapist
47,13,['N'],Okay.,client
47,14,['O'],"All right, take care, bye.",therapist
48,0,['N'],"You know that my friends were happy, um, that I'm like this cool person who moved from in the middle of nowhere, has a strange accent that-",client
48,1,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
48,2,['N'],"-they like all my stories, they are really receptive-",client
48,3,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
48,4,['N'],-but they don't know that I have one diabetes story.,client
48,5,['O'],Okay.,therapist
48,6,['N'],That one I haven't shared yet.,client
48,7,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
48,8,['N'],"So, I guess I'll make it short to exactly the incident 'cause I know we can't avoid it now. Uh, yeah, well, that one what happened was I-I was invited to my first party in this crew-",client
48,9,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
48,10,['N'],-which I was super excited about.,client
48,11,['O'],Sure.,therapist
48,12,['N'],"But, it was an evening party and we all wore really nice dresses-",client
48,13,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
48,14,['N'],"-the short ones, the really huggy ones. [chuckles]",client
48,15,['O'],Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,therapist
48,16,['C'],"So I actually decided, and I know this wasn't the smartest decision of mine, but I did not wear my insulin pump.",client
48,17,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
48,18,['C'],Which was the reason why I didn't want quite to address 'cause I know better. I-,client
48,19,['CR'],You probably think that I'm going to get on your case about that or something.,therapist
48,20,['N'],"Yes, I know, I know, I know.",client
48,21,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
48,22,['C'],Like the learning is done but-,client
48,23,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
48,24,['N'],-but yes I guess it's unavoidable that we address it. [laughter],client
48,25,['CR'],"Yeah and I-- Yeah, you really-- You're already like, you're taking a look at this and sure don't need me like-- Obviously, you don't want to be doing that in the first place, but—",therapist
48,26,['C'],Yeah.,client
48,27,"['CR', 'OQ']","Yeah, clearly, you made a decision because you didn't want to stand out in some way I'm guessing. So, let's-let's talk more about that. Tell me where would you like to take this?",therapist
49,0,['OQ'],"All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-",therapist
49,1,['N'],Mm.,client
49,2,['OQ'],-what was different this time and your thoughts about coming?,therapist
49,3,['N'],"I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here.",client
49,4,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
49,5,['C'],"I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles]",client
49,6,['CQ'],"Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time?",therapist
49,7,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,8,['GI'],"Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, ""Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together-",therapist
49,9,['N'],Mm.,client
49,10,['GI'],"-and, uh--"" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really.",therapist
49,11,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,12,['SR'],"So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family.",therapist
49,13,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,14,['CQ'],"Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?",therapist
49,15,['N'],"Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles]",client
49,16,['O'],Yeah. Yeah.,therapist
49,17,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,18,['O'],Yeah. Yeah.,therapist
49,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,20,"['GI', 'OQ']","Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, ""Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past?",therapist
49,21,['N'],"Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles]",client
49,22,['OQ'],"Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together?",therapist
49,23,['N'],"Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget.",client
49,24,['O'],Yeah?,therapist
49,25,['N'],That's why I am still a bit—,client
49,26,['O'],"Yeah, that's okay.",therapist
49,27,['N'],[chuckles],client
49,28,['CQ'],"So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if—",therapist
49,29,['N'],When I'm feeling uncomfortable?,client
49,30,['GI'],"Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful.",therapist
49,31,['N'],Okay.,client
49,32,['CQ'],Yeah?,therapist
49,33,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,34,['SR'],"Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.",therapist
49,35,['N'],Mm.,client
49,36,['CQ'],"So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort?",therapist
49,37,['C'],[sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt.,client
49,38,['O'],"Yeah, okay.",therapist
49,39,['C'],"Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so-",client
49,40,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
49,41,['C'],"-I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself.",client
49,42,['CQ'],"Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah.",therapist
49,43,['C'],About 80. [chuckles],client
49,44,['CQ'],"About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?",therapist
49,45,['C'],"I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident.",client
49,46,['CQ'],"Yeah? But, what would-",therapist
49,47,['N'],Yes.,client
49,48,['CQ'],-your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit?,therapist
49,49,['N'],"What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles]",client
49,50,['GI'],"Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out.",therapist
49,51,['S'],"It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?",client
49,52,['O'],Mm.,therapist
49,53,['S'],When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter-,client
49,54,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
49,55,['S'],"-so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles]",client
49,56,['CQ'],"Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?",therapist
49,57,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,58,['CQ'],"Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with—",therapist
49,59,['S'],"Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles]",client
49,60,['SR'],"Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford-",therapist
49,61,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,62,['CQ'],"-'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think?",therapist
49,63,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,64,['CQ'],"Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?",therapist
49,65,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,66,['O'],Yeah? Yeah.,therapist
49,67,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,68,['CQ'],"There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that?",therapist
49,69,['C'],"I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but—",client
49,70,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
49,71,['C'],Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles],client
49,72,['O'],Mm.,therapist
49,73,['C'],"I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards-",client
49,74,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
49,75,['C'],-so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon.,client
49,76,['OQ'],"Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?",therapist
49,77,['N'],Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles],client
49,78,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
49,79,['N'],"I don't know. Kids maybe, but-",client
49,80,['O'],Okay.,therapist
49,81,['C'],"-I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate.",client
49,82,['CR'],"Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps.",therapist
49,83,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,84,"['CQ', 'CR']","Yeah? Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time-",therapist
49,85,['N'],[chuckles],client
49,86,['CR'],"-wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?"" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point.",therapist
49,87,['N'],Mm.,client
49,88,['CQ'],"And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah?",therapist
49,89,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,90,['CQ'],"When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?",therapist
49,91,['C'],"Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles]",client
49,92,['O'],I don't know.,therapist
49,93,['S'],I don't know. It's been fun up to now-,client
49,94,['OQ'],What's your hunch? Yeah.,therapist
49,95,['N'],"-but I really do wanna travel, so.",client
49,96,['CQ'],"Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what—",therapist
49,97,['N'],"Um, Egypt, always been, yeah.",client
49,98,['CQ'],Egypt?,therapist
49,99,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,100,['OQ'],"Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh?",therapist
49,101,['N'],"Oh, I just think it's just fascinating.",client
49,102,['CQ'],Yeah?,therapist
49,103,['N'],"Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and-",client
49,104,['O'],Oh.,therapist
49,105,['N'],-somewhere I've always wanted to go.,client
49,106,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
49,107,['N'],"It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles].",client
49,108,['O'],"No, that's true.",therapist
49,109,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,110,['O'],But for obvious times.,therapist
49,111,['N'],Yep.,client
49,112,['O'],It could be very different.,therapist
49,113,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,114,['CQ'],"Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go?",therapist
49,115,['N'],"Oh, since I was young, early teens.",client
49,116,['CQ'],"Oh, yeah?",therapist
49,117,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,118,['OQ'],"Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream?",therapist
49,119,['C'],"Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles]",client
49,120,['O'],"Yeah. Well, yeah.",therapist
49,121,['N'],Mm.,client
49,122,['O'],"There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow.",therapist
49,123,['N'],Mm.,client
49,124,['OQ'],Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront?,therapist
49,125,['C'],"I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle.",client
49,126,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
49,127,['N'],Yeah. It will be a big change.,client
49,128,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that?",therapist
49,129,['C'],"Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy.",client
49,130,['OQ'],"No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you?",therapist
49,131,['C'],"Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so.",client
49,132,['O'],Okay.,therapist
49,133,['C'],"You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles]",client
49,134,['CQ'],"Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment.",therapist
49,135,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,136,['GI'],"We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe-",therapist
49,137,['N'],Mm. [chuckles],client
49,138,"['CQ', 'GI']","-it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah?",therapist
49,139,['N'],Mm.,client
49,140,['OQ'],Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that?,therapist
49,141,['N'],"Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know.",client
49,142,['O'],Mm.,therapist
49,143,['C'],"Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself.",client
49,144,['ADVI'],"Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy.",therapist
49,145,['C'],What? Cutting off some of my friendships?,client
49,146,['ADVI'],"Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt.",therapist
49,147,['N'],Mm.,client
49,148,['CQ'],"Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it?",therapist
49,149,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,150,['CQ'],"It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?",therapist
49,151,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,152,['O'],Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?,therapist
49,153,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,154,['OQ'],"So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits.",therapist
49,155,['N'],Mm.,client
49,156,['CQ'],"Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-",therapist
49,157,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,158,['CQ'],"-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?",therapist
49,159,['N'],Mm. Yeah.,client
49,160,['O'],"Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it.",therapist
49,161,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,162,['GI'],"Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that.",therapist
49,163,['N'],Yeah.,client
49,164,['OQ'],Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet?,therapist
49,165,['C'],Find the scissors. [laughs],client
49,166,['SR'],"Yeah, find the scissors.",therapist
49,167,['C'],Cut out the girls.,client
49,168,['O'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",therapist
49,169,['N'],"Then, um, I don't know if the debts are still gonna be there or not but I-I've gotta find-",client
49,170,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
49,171,['C'],-a way to pay them off and-,client
49,172,['CR'],Truly.,therapist
49,173,['N'],-I don't know how I'm gonna do that.,client
49,174,['ADVI'],"Yeah. Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful.",therapist
49,175,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
49,176,['GI'],"Yeah, and of the things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a great service here, um, and something that you can get to.",therapist
49,177,['N'],Mm.,client
49,178,['ADVI'],So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.,therapist
49,179,['N'],"Mm-hmm, that will be good.",client
49,180,['O'],Okay.,therapist
49,181,['N'],Yeah.,client
50,0,['S'],"So, uh, I guess the issue is that, um, you know, my doctor seems to think that my-my blood pressure's a little high, but I really don't think that there's a problem. And you know, I eat really well. Um. And, you know, she suggested that, um, I watch my caffeine but really, caffeine is not a problem for me.",client
50,1,"['CQ', 'CR']","Okay. Um, but we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. So it's a little bit of, I'm not sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?",therapist
50,2,['S'],"Well, you know, sometimes it makes me a little jittery and, you know, I have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers, but-- And-and working, um, in the hospital, they don't really look so highly on-on going the bathroom frequently. But you know, it-it keeps me awake, it keeps me aware, it-it makes me more able to like, you know, do my job better. And so I really don't see that it's a-it's a real issue.",client
50,3,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
50,4,['N'],"Um, you know, and-and-- I mean, maybe my blood pressure is a little high, but—",client
50,5,['CR'],"Yeah. So let me see if I had this. So y- so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda on your game?",therapist
50,6,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
50,7,['CR'],"Um, and then there's some negatives with, um, you know, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your boss may not want you, you know, checking out-",therapist
50,8,['N'],Right.,client
50,9,['SR'],"-on the hospital floor, you know, for frequently.",therapist
50,10,['N'],"Gotta stay on, yeah.",client
50,11,['CQ'],"Yeah, yeah, and then the blood pressure thing. Does that sound about right?",therapist
50,12,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and sometimes, like I said, it does kind of make me a little jittery and, um, I don't know. I-I-I'm not- I'm not as happy and relaxed as I normally am. But you know, I-I really like it, and-and like I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and-and I'm-- I-I feel like I'm much more observant.",client
50,13,['CQ'],Yeah. How about frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?,therapist
50,14,['N'],Yeah. I have about four cups a day.,client
50,15,['CR'],Okay. Okay. And that feels about right to you?,therapist
50,16,['N'],"Yeah. I mean, I've-- I mean, it's the co-workers that-that work at night. Gosh, they bring in a carafe.",client
50,17,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
50,18,['N'],"And, uh, I-I can only imagine-",client
50,19,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
50,20,['N'],-what-what their bodies are like.,client
50,21,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? Would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic?",therapist
50,22,['N'],"Reducing it, like-- what do you mean?",client
50,23,['GI'],The number. Just the number.,therapist
50,24,['N'],"Yeah, yeah but, I mean, how-how much are we talking?",client
50,25,['GI'],"I don't-- you tell me. I mean, um, you're-you're drinking four a day.",therapist
50,26,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
50,27,['O'],Um--,therapist
50,28,['S'],"You're probably-- you know, because I-I gotta have that morning cup, I really-- you know I really like waking up and-and that whole ritual. The, um-- you know, making the coffee and-",client
50,29,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
50,30,['S'],-I just really like the flavors.,client
50,31,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
50,32,['S'],"So I-I definitely don't want to give that up, but—",client
50,33,['O'],I gotcha. Okay.,therapist
50,34,['N'],Uh—,client
50,35,['CR'],So that one's important.,therapist
50,36,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
50,37,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
50,38,['S'],"And then, of course, you know, working a 12-hour shift, I-I really think that, you know, the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is-is a really good idea too.",client
50,39,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
50,40,['C'],I could probably get up the mid-morning.,client
50,41,['GI'],I think that's great.,therapist
50,42,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",client
50,43,['CR'],I think so. So you've identified one of the four that might-- you might be willing to-to try-,therapist
50,44,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
50,45,"['CR', 'OQ']",-for a while to-to let go of. What do you- what do you think of that?,therapist
50,46,['C'],I think that does sound all right.,client
50,47,['O'],Okay.,therapist
50,48,['N'],Yeah.,client
50,49,['O'],Good.,therapist
50,50,['C'],I think I could do that.,client
51,0,['OQ'],Tell me what you know about the flu shot?,therapist
51,1,['S'],"Uh, well, I know the flu can be pretty bad, but I'm in pretty good health, so I don't really feel like I need it. Uh, it's kind of just more for old people, right?",client
51,2,"['CQ', 'CR']","Mm, um, so you're thinking it's really just for people who are-are vulnerable to illness?",therapist
51,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
51,4,['CQ'],Would it be okay if I shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?,therapist
51,5,['N'],Okay.,client
51,6,['GI'],"So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.",therapist
51,7,['N'],Okay.,client
51,8,['OQ'],"So having shared that information with you, how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?",therapist
51,9,['N'],"Well, my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu very well-",client
51,10,['O'],Mm.,therapist
51,11,['N'],-and my co-worker is pregnant too.,client
51,12,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
51,13,['C'],"So-so, yeah, I guess, I should, uh, get it for their sake.",client
51,14,['CR'],"Okay, so you've got some people in your life who are vulnerable to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them.",therapist
51,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
52,0,['SR'],"Hi, Nick. Thank you for completing the CRAFFT questionnaire. I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself.",therapist
52,1,['N'],You're welcome.,client
52,2,"['OQ', 'SR']","sI see from the questionnaire, did you have got in trouble while using alcohol? Can you tell me more about that?",therapist
52,3,['S'],"Well, a friend and I would snuck out one night to go to the park, and we got a couple of beers from his house, but the cop came by, and so we threw them in the bushes. He was originally gonna give us a curfew ticket but ended up not to. Luckily, he didn't see the beer.",client
52,4,['CR'],That must be really scary.,therapist
52,5,['N'],"Yeah, it was. If my mom would have found out, she would've killed me.",client
52,6,['OQ'],"I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink?",therapist
52,7,['N'],"Well, I've only tried drinking once or twice.",client
52,8,"['CQ', 'SR']","I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right?",therapist
52,9,['N'],"Yeah, that's right.",client
52,10,['CQ'],"As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay?",therapist
52,11,['S'],"Well, I'm not sure if this information is for me, since I've only been drinking once or twice.",client
52,12,"['OQ', 'SR']","I understand. You're just experimenting with alcohol. Then, how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are?",therapist
52,13,['C'],"Well, all I really know is that it's not good for you.",client
52,14,['CQ'],Are you surprised what that might be true?,therapist
52,15,['S'],"Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too.",client
52,16,"['GI', 'OQ']","Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information?",therapist
52,17,['C'],I really didn't think about how this would affect me playing sports.,client
52,18,['CR'],"Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really wanted to play soccer, and you have great goals about that.",therapist
52,19,['N'],"Yeah, I would like to play soccer in college.",client
52,20,['CR'],That's a great goal to have for yourself.,therapist
52,21,['N'],"Yeah, I would also like to get scholarships.",client
52,22,['SR'],Scholarship will really help you achieving your goals.,therapist
52,23,['N'],Yeah.,client
52,24,['OQ'],I would like to share with you these materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about these risks. What do you think about that?,therapist
52,25,['C'],"Well, I will take a look at it, and I'll definitely read it, and I don't wanna become addicted, and I would like to continue to play sports as long as possible.",client
52,26,['CR'],"It sounds like you're in the right track, looks like you care about your health, and you care about your goals in life. I'm here to answer any questions.",therapist
52,27,['N'],Thanks for all the information.,client
52,28,['O'],You're welcome.,therapist
54,0,['O'],"Oh, hello Scott.",therapist
54,1,['N'],Hi.,client
54,2,['CR'],"Um, we were talking a little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.",therapist
54,3,['C'],I do.,client
54,4,['OQ'],What's going on with that?,therapist
54,5,['C'],"Well, I just can't seem to get back in the gym. I don't wanna-- I-I used to work out quite a bit, and in the last, I dunno, couple of years I've just-- I stopped going. I got busy, and now I'm out of the habit, and I-I really, I dunno, I feel like I need to get back.",client
54,6,['ADVI'],"Well, I mean, I think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to help you get there.",therapist
54,7,['N'],Okay. Um. All right. Um—,client
54,8,['CQ'],What gym do you belong to?,therapist
54,9,['N'],"Uh, I belong to the-the Sport Fitness Center.",client
54,10,['CQ'],Okay. And-and how far away is it from your house?,therapist
54,11,['N'],Just a couple of miles.,client
54,12,"['OPTI', 'SR']","Just a couple of miles. Mm. So you-- you know, you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] too.",therapist
54,13,['N'],"If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?",client
54,14,['ADVI'],"Well, I don't know about that. Um. That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk]",therapist
54,15,['N'],[inaudible 00:01:33] training.,client
54,16,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
54,17,['C'],It-it-it would be important.,client
54,18,['OQ'],"Yeah. So why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? You want to look different, or--?",therapist
54,19,['C'],"Well, I-I-I-I would feel better. My-- I'd-I'd be able to wear more my clothes. I've been growing around the middle and I'd like to, uh, you know, go back to where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know.",client
54,20,['O'],Okay.,therapist
54,21,['C'],I-I'm more comfortable-- I feel better. I think that's the main thing.,client
54,22,"['GI', 'SR']","Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but—",therapist
54,23,['C'],"Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-- I-I am- I'm not getting any younger than I [unintelligible 00:02:18]",client
54,24,"['CR', 'NEGO']","Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before.",therapist
54,25,['C'],Yeah.,client
54,26,['ADVI'],Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it.,therapist
54,27,['C'],I've gotta make time.,client
54,28,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
54,29,['C'],I've gotta make time.,client
54,30,['NEGO'],"Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do.",therapist
54,31,['N'],Yeah. Okay.,client
54,32,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
54,33,['N'],All right.,client
54,34,['ADVI'],"So when I see you next time, you know, that's what I'd like you to do is to, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, um-- You know, 'cause, uh, getting healthier is more important than sleep, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked about.",therapist
54,35,['N'],Okay.,client
54,36,['O'],Okay?,therapist
54,37,['N'],Okay.,client
54,38,['O'],"All right, so I'll see you next week.",therapist
54,39,['N'],Okay. Very good. Thanks.,client
54,40,['O'],All right. All right. Bye.,therapist
55,0,['CQ'],"Miguel, before we end the call, I did want to go over the answers you gave me on the questionnaire about drug use. Is it okay if we go over that right now?",therapist
55,1,['N'],"Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's fine.",client
55,2,"['CQ', 'OQ']","Thanks. When I looked at your form, it looks like you use heroin weekly and you injected. What part of your body do you normally inject in?",therapist
55,3,['N'],"Uh, mostly in my left arm.",client
55,4,['CQ'],"Do you mind if I take a look at your arm, please?",therapist
55,5,['N'],"Uh, no. That's okay. How's that?",client
55,6,['CQ'],"Okay. Well, I don't see any redness. Um, can you go ahead and touch that Miguel, and tell me if it feels warm to you or if it hurts?",therapist
55,7,['N'],"Uh, nope. It feels okay.",client
55,8,"['CQ', 'GI']","Thanks. Just so you know, when I talk to patients about drug use, my job is to be helpful. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what you should do. What I can do is share some information and be a resource. Does that make sense?",therapist
55,9,['N'],"Uh, yeah, that's fine.",client
55,10,['OQ'],Right. What else can you tell me about your heroin use?,therapist
55,11,['N'],"Uh, I don't know. Um, I use maybe a few times a week.",client
55,12,['SR'],A couple of times a week. And where do you get your syringes?,therapist
55,13,['N'],"Syringes? Uh, sometimes I'll buy them at Walgreens. Most times I'll just get them from the needle exchange.",client
55,14,['CQ'],"Uh, what one do you remember?",therapist
55,15,['N'],"Uh, Northeast Glisan.",client
55,16,['CQ'],Okay. How often do you use new deals when you inject?,therapist
55,17,['N'],"Yeah, I use new needles every time, I never share.",client
55,18,['CR'],"Yeah, it sounds like your health is important to you.",therapist
55,19,['N'],"Yeah, that's right.",client
55,20,['SR'],And you showed up today to take care of your migraines.,therapist
55,21,['N'],"Mm-hmm, yap.",client
55,22,['CQ'],"So, uh, you wrote on here that you've experienced withdrawal symptoms when you've stopped using in the past, is that right?",therapist
55,23,['N'],"Uh, yeah. Yeah, if it's, uh, you know, if it's been a couple of days like I can go two days, three days tops before I start to feel really sick.",client
55,24,['OQ'],What does that feel like?,therapist
55,25,['N'],"Uh, geez. Yeah, I mean, it's the obvious stuff like my stomach feels sick, I get the body aches, uh, cold, hot, chills. Uh, everything hurts. Everything is in extremes. My emotions are in extremes. Uh, yeah, it sucks. I don't want to do anything. I just want to stay home and just stay in bed.",client
55,26,['OQ'],That sounds awful. What do you do when that happens?,therapist
55,27,"['N', 'S']","Yeah, I mean, I start to use, I get loaded.",client
55,28,['OQ'],Okay. How else does injecting heroin impact your life?,therapist
55,29,['S'],"Uh, you know, I get loaded and I-I can- I can function. I can go to work and, you know, do normal things, you know. Uh, I mean, there's been maybe just a couple of times where I wasn't feeling all that well, and I, uh, I was late a couple of times to work or it might overslept from the night before or whatever, but it's about it. Uh, I just want to avoid getting sick right now. That's my main priority.",client
55,30,['OQ'],"Yeah. You want to stay healthy. I'm curious, what do you like about using heroin?",therapist
55,31,['S'],"Um, well, you know, I like the way it feels. Um, you know what I mean? When I shoot up my anxiety, goes away, my depression goes away. Uh, things that usually make life really difficult, uh, get a lot easier.",client
55,32,['OQ'],And what about your use do you not like?,therapist
55,33,['C'],"Uh, yeah. I mean, I think everybody who uses at least has some concern of overdosing on some level. Right? Uh, so that's something I'm concerned about is accidentally overdosing. And, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't want to get an infection in my arm, you know, just the usual things. I have a hard time hitting veins sometimes, and I gotta dig around a little bit and I would get worried about, you know, hitting something that I shouldn't or, you know, getting infections.",client
55,34,['CR'],"Mm-hmm. So on one hand, using heroin feels like an escape from things you don't want to think about. On the other hand, it puts you at risk for an overdose in infections.",therapist
55,35,['N'],"Yeah, that's right.",client
55,36,['OQ'],"So weighing what you like and don't like about your use, where do you want to go from here? What do you want to do differently?",therapist
55,37,['N'],I don't know.,client
55,38,['OPTI'],"Well, some patients who inject heroin are interested in a medication called Suboxone. It reduces cravings, withdrawal symptoms without making you high. Some patients want information on how to inject drugs more safely or where to get new syringes. Other patients want to carry Naloxone which is a drug that can prevent one from overdosing.",therapist
55,39,['N'],"Uh, are you talking about Narcan? Is that the same thing?",client
55,40,['O'],Yes.,therapist
55,41,['N'],"Yeah, I got some of that already. I got it from the needle exchange.",client
55,42,['CQ'],Where do you keep it?,therapist
55,43,['N'],"Uh, at home mostly.",client
55,44,['CQ'],In case you see someone overdosing?,therapist
55,45,['N'],"I mean, that's a concern, of course, right? Uh, I'm on the app just in case somebody nearby is OD-ing and I can get pinged. But no, mostly I just keep it in case I overdose, uh, and, uh, I'm realizing now I have it but I haven't told my roommate about it so—",client
55,46,['SR'],Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing.,therapist
55,47,['N'],"Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.",client
55,48,['OQ'],Anything else you want to do about your use?,therapist
55,49,['C'],"I would really like a little bit of information on, uh, injecting in my arm.",client
55,50,['GI'],Okay. I can email you some information on how to inject in a way that reduces the chance of infection and we also have behavioral health specialists in our clinic who can go over how to reduce harm with you. I bet the syringe exchange has similar resources too.,therapist
55,51,['N'],Okay.,client
55,52,['SR'],So it sounds like you have two goals right now. You want to tell your housemate about where you keep the Narcan in case you overdose and you want some information on how to inject safely?,therapist
55,53,['N'],Mm-hmm. Yeah.,client
55,54,['CQ'],"How confident are you to do these two things? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 meaning not ready at all and 10 meaning very ready, what number would you pick?",therapist
55,55,['C'],I'd probably say 10.,client
55,56,['OQ'],Okay. You're very ready. Why do you think you picked a 10 instead of a lower number like 8?,therapist
55,57,['C'],"Well, uh, I don't want to have an overdose and I don't want to get an infection. Seems like easy things to do.",client
55,58,['OQ'],What kind of plan could you put in place to make sure you meet these goals?,therapist
55,59,['C'],"Um, well, I can talk to my housemate tomorrow night. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't work tomorrow night so he'll be around.",client
55,60,['OQ'],That's great. And how do you want to get the information on injecting?,therapist
55,61,['C'],"Uh, if you could email me that right now, that'd be great.",client
55,62,['O'],Okay. I'd like to hear how your plan worked out for you if you're willing to come back for another appointment. I look forward to hearing about what worked for you and what was challenging say in four weeks.,therapist
55,63,['N'],"Uh, yeah, yeah. It's fine. Let's do that.",client
55,64,['O'],Great. I'll see you then.,therapist
56,0,['OQ'],"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home.",therapist
56,1,['N'],Pretty good.,client
56,2,['O'],Yeah?,therapist
56,3,['N'],"Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there.",client
56,4,['OQ'],Yeah. What are you really glad about?,therapist
56,5,['N'],"Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home.",client
56,6,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
56,7,['N'],"Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home.",client
56,8,['OQ'],"I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?",therapist
56,9,"['N', 'S']","Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually.",client
56,10,['OQ'],"So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down.",therapist
56,11,['S'],"Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that.",client
56,12,['CR'],Mm. So you've been working really hard-,therapist
56,13,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,14,"['CR', 'SR']","-through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home.",therapist
56,15,['N'],Yes.,client
56,16,"['CR', 'SR']",And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things.,therapist
56,17,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,18,['SR'],"And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?",therapist
56,19,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
56,20,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
56,21,['S'],"So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding.",client
56,22,"['CR', 'SR']","Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work.",therapist
56,23,['N'],"Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah.",client
56,24,['OQ'],What are you concerned about?,therapist
56,25,['S'],That I'll- that I'll fall again.,client
56,26,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
56,27,['S'],"I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will.",client
56,28,['SR'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself.",therapist
56,29,['N'],No.,client
56,30,['OQ'],And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall.,therapist
56,31,['S'],"No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much.",client
56,32,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
56,33,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,34,['OQ'],"Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something-",therapist
56,35,['S'],"Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home.",client
56,36,['CR'],And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.,therapist
56,37,"['N', 'S']","Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down-",client
56,38,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
56,39,['S'],"Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard.",client
56,40,['O'],Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.,therapist
56,41,['S'],"And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi.",client
56,42,['CR'],"Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which-",therapist
56,43,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,44,"['CR', 'SR']",-might have probably helped you break your fall this time.,therapist
56,45,['N'],"Right, right.",client
56,46,['CQ'],"Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that?",therapist
56,47,['N'],"She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself.",client
56,48,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
56,49,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,50,['CR'],"Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- ""Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.""",therapist
56,51,['S'],"That's a strong word, isn't it, ""betrayed"". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know.",client
56,52,['O'],Right.,therapist
56,53,['N'],"But, um-",client
56,54,['CR'],"So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home-",therapist
56,55,['N'],Right.,client
56,56,['CR'],-and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.,therapist
56,57,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,58,['OQ'],Wh-what do you think about that?,therapist
56,59,['N'],"Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling-",client
56,60,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
56,61,['S'],"-really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that.",client
56,62,['O'],"Yeah, right.",therapist
56,63,['N'],"So, um, 'cause I am alone.",client
56,64,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
56,65,['N'],So—,client
56,66,"['CR', 'SR']",So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and--,therapist
56,67,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,68,['OQ'],"What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have?",therapist
56,69,['N'],"Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if-",client
56,70,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
56,71,['N'],-if something does happen?,client
56,72,['GI'],"Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button.",therapist
56,73,['N'],I think I saw something like that on TV.,client
56,74,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
56,75,['N'],Is it- does it really work?,client
56,76,['GI'],It does really work.,therapist
56,77,['N'],"'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk]",client
56,78,['O'],Right. Right.,therapist

56,89,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,90,['OQ'],"So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider.",therapist
56,91,['C'],That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that.,client
56,92,['O'],Mm.,therapist
56,93,['C'],I definitely wanna do that.,client
56,94,['OQ'],Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe?,therapist
56,95,['C'],"Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and-",client

56,109,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,110,['GI'],"Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home-",therapist
56,111,['N'],Right.,client
56,112,['OQ'],"-and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you?",therapist
56,113,['C'],"Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi?",client

56,116,"['ADVI', 'OPTI']",-and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support.,therapist
56,117,['C'],"Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving?",client
56,118,['CR'],"Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe.",therapist
56,119,['N'],Yeah.,client
56,120,['GI'],"And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be.",therapist

56,147,['N'],Really?,client
56,148,['CR'],"Yes. And actually, you-you have really demonstrated to me anyway, a lot of strength and courage because you have continued to persevere and work through this and not everybody does.

58,5,['N'],"Well, I'm, uh, I-I used to work out pretty good. I-I would go to the gym several times a week. I had kind of a schedule, um—",client
58,6,['SR'],That's really a lot. Very good.,therapist

58,8,['O'],Wow.,therapist
58,9,['S'],"Well, and I-- But I was working at a different company, where I had a little bit different schedule, a little more free time than I have now, so I just don't have the time like I used to.",client
58,10,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
58,11,['C'],"And I-- And really, it's kind of an excuse, I guess, cause I-I could probably make the time, but it's-it's easier to just keep working or-",client
58,12,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
58,13,['N'],-just being in bed or whatever.,client
58,14,['SR'],"But that goal of the half-marathon, you know, it's really important that you were willing to put all the time into getting ready for it, which, from what I've heard from other people, is almost like a job in and of itself.",therapist
58,15,['C'],"I-it was. A-and it was huge for me cause I'd never really been a runner, you know, but it-it was very motivating, and-and—",client
58,16,['OQ'],What'd you like about it?,therapist
58,17,['C'],"I don't know. I guess there's kind of an adrenaline rush to it. Kinda almost like, you know, uh, kind of a high, I guess.",client
58,18,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
58,19,['C'],"So yeah-- That's-- I-I really enjoyed it. And I-I liked the feeling that I was doing something good for myself. I liked that, too. I-it kind of-- It so-- It gave me a little bit of self-esteem, I guess.",client
58,20,['SR'],"I-it a-almost, um, feels like you identified as being a runner, like an athlete?",therapist
58,21,['N'],I-I subscribed to the magazine a while.,client
58,22,['CQ'],Do you really?,therapist
58,23,['C'],I did.,client
58,24,['O'],[unintelligible 00:01:40],therapist

58,27,['N'],-I did burn for a time.,client
58,28,['SR'],Got into the culture?,therapist
58,29,['C'],"I got into the whole culture. I was-- I-I felt as good as I’ve felt in many, many years. And now I’ve kind of let that all slide, and-- Well, I had a foot injury, too, which kind of started the whole problem.",client
58,30,['O'],"Okay, alright. Cause it’s tough, it's really, it is. I mean I’ve, um, I’m sure you’ve been told before by whomever, uh, diagnosed your foot injury, but if not, let me know if it gets so tough on your body [unintelligible 00:02:10] let me know. So--",therapist
58,31,['C'],"It-it is. And I-- it-it may be why I can’t really run again, but I can certainly, you know, ride a stationary bike-",client
58,32,['O'],Okay.,therapist
58,33,['C'],"-and do all the other things in a gym that you can do when you’re not running, so, it just nakes you to [unintelligible 00:02:23]",client
58,34,"['OQ', 'SR']","Oh, and yet and at the same time you know your body well enough, and you-you’re willing to pay attention to your doctor’s advice about the running, right now, for you, not the best thing.

58,35,['C'],"Um, well, um, I like-- The bike is pretty good. Uh, even the uh, you know, the kind of a rolling machine is okay. And the uh, the elliptical. Any of that’s fine. I-I really don’t, uh-- I don’t dislike any of it. Kind of once you get into the rhythm, yeah, it’s fine",client
58,36,['CQ'],"If you were to pick one of those, which one do you enjoy the most, um, would be most likely to do?",therapist
58,37,['C'],Probably the elliptical.,client
58,38,['O'],The elliptical. Okay. Yeah. [unintelligible 00:03:07] like kind of almost like running.,therapist
58,39,['C'],"Well, it is.",client
58,40,['O'],[chuckles].,therapist
58,41,['C'],"It is without any of the impact, so it is true.",client
58,42,['O'],"Okay. And-and what do you- do you-- Some folks, you know, [unintelligible 00:03:18] put on music, kind of- kind of.",therapist
58,43,['N'],"Yeah, I do headphones.",client
58,44,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
58,45,['N'],"I got my headphones, and I got my, uh, kind of [unintelligible 00:03:24], if you know what I mean",client
58,46,['SR'],"Okay. Get your rocking out, running on the elliptical playlist.",therapist
58,47,['N'],Yeah,client
58,48,['CQ'],"And, um, so you were-- You said that you’ve been going several times a week, which is really an extraordinary number, I-I think it’s four, five times a week?",therapist
58,49,['C'],"Yeah. I was going literally every other day, you know. And then, some days I would, you know, I’d run, and I’d go to the gym the next day, so I would-- I was very-- I don’t really feel it necessary to get back to that level, but I need to do something cause I’m doing nothing right now.",client
58,50,['SR'],Nothing. Okay.,therapist
58,51,['N'],"I should-- Or next to nothing. I walk to the grocery store or whatever’s handy when I have time, but yeah.",client
58,52,['OQ'],"So what ideas do you have about initially just getting started, and what-what would you do [unintelligible 00:04:13] ?",therapist
58,53,['C'],"Well, if I could just get myself over there once, 'cause usually that’s the hardest thing. It’s just going there. So I think that's-- You know, I’ve thought about it a little bit, I think I just need to make that first trip over there and just kind of to take it easy that first time. Just show up 'cause I think that’s really what I need to do. I justt need to go over there.",client
58,54,['OQ'],What would help you do that?,therapist
58,55,['C'],"Um, knowing that my schedule isn’t gonna be too crazy that day where I could spare an hour or so, and-and just go do it.",client
58,56,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
58,57,['N'],And then I-- [unintelligible 00:04:41] kinda nice [unintelligible 00:4:42] gonna be troublesome.,client
58,58,['O'],[unintelligible 00:04:45]?,therapist
58,59,['C'],"Um, I don’t know. I think- I think the time has just been the biggest thing, you know, and-and I-I guess the motivation really hasn’t been there. I mean, you know, it’s not like- I don’t really have a goal. I don’t really have a, you know I don't, other than maybe reducing my waistline, you know, I don't really have a-a set number like I'm gonna run a marathon and you know.",client
58,60,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
58,61,['C'],"You know, so I think the just running off the playlist. I-I guess maybe if I made a goal would helped too.",client
58,62,['SR'],"Mm-hmm- mm-hmm. So that-that-that half marathon was, uh, a very specific concrete thing and you could envision yourself, and you're ready for it and the day of and all that kinda stuff.",therapist
58,63,['N'],Yeah.,client
58,64,['O'],Um.,therapist
58,65,['C'],Plus there's people who have done that countless times and you can go read what their-,client
58,66,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
58,67,['C'],-regimen was so you get feedback too. And then [unintelligible 00:05:37] did this from this day and so on.,client
58,68,['SR'],"So sometimes-- almost sounds like, um, your feedback would be, uh, useful to you. Like some immediate feedback in terms of like, um, like [inaudible 00:05:53]",therapist
58,69,['C'],Yeah. Maybe.,client
58,70,['O'],[inaudible 00:05:55],therapist
58,71,['C'],That might not be be a bad idea. [inaudible 00:05:59],client
58,72,['O'],[inaudible 00:06:01],therapist
58,73,['ADVI'],"-somebody there and, you know, hooking up with somebody.",therapist
58,74,['C'],I think that'd be great. I-I never have really found anybody that like to exercise with the pace that I wanted to. They were all either going way too fast or not even moving at all.,client
58,75,['O'],Okay.,therapist
58,76,['S'],So it's kinda hard to meet up with somebody that can kind of maybe kind of give you a push [unintelligible 00:06:38]-,client
58,77,['O'],Okay.,therapist
58,78,['N'],-might be a challenge.,client
58,79,"['CQ', 'SR']","There might be something [unintelligible 00:06:43] because you're such a social guy. And so to be able to be exercising and be talking and enjoying yourself- you like the music too, right?",therapist
58,80,['N'],"Yeah, that's right, well I-",client
58,81,['ADVI'],"And if you arrange to meet somebody there, you're very good at, uh, you know, uh, keeping the agreement.",therapist
58,82,['C'],"Okay, that's a great idea I hadn't thought of that-that's- I hadn't really, uh, I-I kinda dismissed that early on, I hadn't really even considered that, yeah.",client
58,83,['SR'],"And in for right now it just be, you'll be happy with getting there one time.",therapist
58,84,['C'],"If I could get there-- I know if I could get there-- if I could pick, you know, uh, these are the days I'm going to go to the gym and I know these things last time.",client
58,85,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
58,86,['C'],"So if I- if I could-- I mean, I wanna get there three times a week.",client
58,87,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
58,88,['C'],"I wanna get there on Saturdays or Sundays and Tuesdays and Fridays, or something like that, then I could probably [unintelligible 00:07:34]",client
58,89,['SR'],And days that you know of on your less rigorous schedule that you're more likely to succeed [unintelligible 00:07:40] I really like how you're picking like three days a week instead of some days a week.,therapist
58,90,['N'],"Right, yeah. Well, it's just not-",client
58,91,['SR'],Very clear you understand the whole idea of giving yourself a day off in between.,therapist
58,92,['N'],"Oh yeah, yeah, it doesn't do any good to just try to injure your- injure yourself especially when you're a bit normal like me.",client
58,93,['SR'],"Okay, yeah, I know that, yeah, yeah. Okay, so. So, um, so are you sure you wanna try to start out with the- that initial [unintelligible 00:08:07]",therapist
58,94,['N'],You gotta get over there.,client
58,95,['SR'],"When you find someone to go with, great, if not, you get your own [unintelligible 00:08:12] your own music and uh, I'll be- I'll be trying just to-to see um, what is like for you, having actually done that [unintelligible 00:08:20]",therapist
58,96,['N'],Very good.,client

60,14,['N'],"I like that piece of jewelry, can I? [laughs]",client
60,15,['SR'],"Right, yeah, but with cigarettes, there is a sharing. You don't see that with any other drugs?",therapist
60,16,['N'],"Right. Right, yeah. You can't have my stash. [laughs]",client
60,17,"['OQ', 'SR']","You can't, no, not one of mine. So, um when are you thinking you might want to do this?",therapist

60,27,['OPTI'],"Okay. Yeah, no, all those things are good. I mean, I think you know, the will- picking a quit date has been found to be really effective. And, um, uh, I know you had talked earlier and then we'll end in just a couple minutes, but about, you know, like, the willingness or the readiness and most-- a lot of people, a lot of my clients have shared with me that when they woke up that morning, they truly had no idea that was going to be their last cigarette.",therapist
60,28,['N'],"Oh, really? So they didn't have an exact date, they just decided.",client
60,29,['GI'],"No. Or- or some of them didn't have an exact date, but m-more importantly, was they-they just didn't know that was the day.",therapist

60,38,['C'],-that's cool I'll have to find out about that.,client

60,41,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
60,42,['N'],"That seems to be like, uh, a false setting up, you know, like, come on.",client
60,43,['GI'],"Actually, you would be amazed how many people do it.",therapist
60,44,['N'],Really?,client
60,45,['GI'],"Yeah, yeah, they really do, and smokers. Yeah, and drinkers, they do, yes. Yeah.",therapist
60,46,['N'],"Or, like, you know, setting up-- but what is that that they say? Um, you know, like, it's- it's the terminology, you know, with all the anxiety and letting go, you know, like I'm gonna [crosstalk].",client
60,47,['SR'],Like a new beginning.,therapist
60,48,['N'],"Yeah. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.",client
60,49,['CR'],"So, for you, it's your, you know, it sounds like you really want to be prepared.",therapist
60,50,['N'],"Right, right.",client
60,51,['SR'],"And yet, on some level, you know, that it's gonna be a lot of hard work for you because of, you know, you've already known how anxious you get about a stash-",therapist
60,52,['N'],Right.,client
60,53,['ADVI'],"So if you have a stash Nicorette gum if you decide to use it, I mean, you'd have to have other stashes, you know.",therapist
60,54,['S'],"Yeah, and you know, another thing, uh, uh, you know, it's so so bang, but the weight gain is like—",client
60,55,"['CQ', 'SR']",That worries you?,therapist
60,56,['N'],Uh-huh.,client
60,57,['GI'],"Yeah. So, so if-if your doctor says it's okay with the Wellbutrin, one-- uh, we see very little if any weight gain-",therapist
60,58,['N'],"Oh, really?",client
60,59,['SR'],"-with the Wellbutrin, yes.",therapist
60,60,['N'],"Oh, that's awesome, to know too.",client
60,61,['GI'],"Yeah. And, um, the same with the Nicorette gum, because it- nicotine is an appetite suppressant.",therapist
60,62,['N'],"Right, right. Just like [inaudible 00:04:06] Or your chocolate and all that.",client
60,63,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
60,64,['N'],So just switching my addiction. [laughs],client
60,65,"['ADVI', 'SR']","If you will. And that's if you decide you want to try a replacement therapy and that's what we call it and it-it kind of sounds from what you've described with your fear about you know, what it would be like of the withdrawal and everything like that. W-why you don't have to do it that way, you don't have to go cold-cold turkey.",therapist
60,66,['S'],"Yeah, God, I don't think I could.",client
60,67,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
60,68,['S'],"You know, I mean like I said three days was like-",client
60,69,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
60,70,['S'],"-three years, and all I could think about I was like obsessing about it.",client
60,71,['ADVI'],"Yes. Yeah, yeah. So I think that- I think, I'm just a really big advocate of w-whatever is gonna enhance the quality and the length of your life. And if somebody becomes addicted to nicotine go- gum, God bless them. They're still gonna live longer, you know what I mean?",therapist
60,72,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
60,73,['O'],So—,therapist
60,74,['N'],Yeah. That's true.,client
60,75,['NEGO'],"So, we'll do that so we'll-we'll talk about the hypnosis a little bit more, you know, you'll talk to your doc. Um, you'll do your research, you know, about programs and stuff, I'll give you any information I have and we'll take it from there. But it's sounding like the quit date might be coming up fairly-- like within the next two, three months.",therapist
60,76,['N'],Okay.,client
60,77,['SR'],"I, uh, mean that's up to you.",therapist
60,78,['N'],Yeah. And I mean and that's-that's a reasonable thing- [crosstalk],client
60,79,['CR'],You get to decide.,therapist
60,80,['C'],"-I don't feel like I'm like you know, it's gonna be-- I think gradually getting my- wrapping my brain around it will help, you know, before I just do, you know.",client
60,81,"['OPTI', 'OQ']",Yeah. Is it appealing the thought of quitting with a group at the same time?,therapist
60,82,['N'],"You know, I always love, um, I've been in other group therapies-",client
60,83,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
60,84,['N'],-and the feedback is really nice and the support-,client
60,85,['O'],"Okay, yeah.",therapist
60,86,['N'],-system is really good.,client
60,87,"['NEGO', 'SR']","Okay. So, that really sounds like something we can do.",therapist
60,88,['N'],Yeah.,client
60,89,['GI'],"So, that would be can- the Cancer Society. So, we can look into that.",therapist
60,90,['N'],"All right, great. Good. Great.",client
60,91,"['OPTI', 'SR']","All right. Well, I appreciate you coming in. We'll set up another appointment and, um, get our resources together. We'll take it from there and—",therapist
60,92,['N'],And thank you for all the information. I appreciate it.,client

60,94,['N'],Thank you.,client
61,0,['O'],"Hi Mrs. Smith, my name is Terri, I'm one of the nurses who works with Dr. Fields.",therapist
61,1,['N'],"Well, I remember you. Yeah, we met once before.",client
61,2,['O'],"Yes, I think when you were in last time.",therapist
61,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,4,"['OQ', 'SR']","And I know that, uh, Dr. Fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class to see how that would go, and I wanted to-to check in with you and see how tai chi went.",therapist
61,5,['N'],"Well, I went once.",client
61,6,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,7,['S'],"Yeah and, um, it was very-very beautiful to see and the instructor was very nice, but I felt kind of self-conscious because I'm still in my walker.",client
61,8,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,9,['S'],"And I had to sit in the chair. I couldn't, you know, do what they were doing.",client
61,10,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
61,11,['S'],"So, it's-- it was-- I simply felt self-conscious.",client
61,12,['SR'],"Uh-huh. So, you thought it was beautiful and you liked the instructor, but you were a little self-conscious because you were in a chair?",therapist
61,13,['S'],A lot self-conscious.,client
61,14,['SR'],"A lot self-conscious, uh-huh.",therapist
61,15,['S'],Yeah.,client
61,16,['OQ'],"What were you hoping to achieve with the, um, by going to tai chi?",therapist
61,17,['N'],"Well, like Dr. Fields told me, it helps with balance, and I'm still having the wobblies. So, I was really hoping that I could get to the point where I could benefit from what they had to offer. Um, yeah, mostly my balance, mostly my balance.",client
61,18,['CR'],"Uh-huh. So, you're hoping that it would help with balance, but you didn't see the- maybe the results you were looking for?",therapist
61,19,['N'],Not yet.,client
61,20,['SR'],Not yet.,therapist
61,21,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,22,['OQ'],Uh-huh. What is your overall goal? What are you working towards?,therapist
61,23,['C'],I wanna go home.,client
61,24,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,25,['C'],"Yes, I really do.",client
61,26,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm, and what is it that's important to you about getting home?",therapist
61,27,['C'],[sighs] Everything. I want to be with my little dog.,client
61,28,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
61,29,['N'],"He's really so cute, and I miss my garden.",client
61,30,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
61,31,['C'],"And I just miss being independent, going to sleep when I want to sleep and getting up when I want to get up and-and, uh, cooking for myself. The independence. Sure I miss being independent.",client
61,32,['SR'],"Uh-huh. So, you're wanting to get home to your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?",therapist
61,33,['C'],Yes.,client
61,34,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
61,35,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,36,['OQ'],What do you think you need to do in order to be able to achieve that goal of getting home?,therapist
61,37,['N'],"Well, they told me that I need to be able to walk down the hallway and back, even with the walker, being secure and not with the wobblies.",client
61,38,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,39,['S'],And I haven't gotten there yet.,client
61,40,['CQ'],And do you agree that that's what you need to do in order to be able to get home?,therapist
61,41,['C'],Yeah.,client
61,42,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,43,['S'],I-I don't want to fall.,client
61,44,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,45,['N'],"I-I've had friends that had that happen. So, um, I-I agree a little, with some hesitation, but I do agree.",client
61,46,['OQ'],"Uh-huh, and tell me how your physical therapy is going?",therapist
61,47,['C'],"Oh, it's better.",client
61,48,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
61,49,['N'],It still hurts. It- it's-- I'm getting better. I'm-I'm getting better. It's not quite as painful.,client
61,50,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
61,51,['N'],"Yeah, so-",client
61,52,['SR'],"So, it sounds like, um, you can see that you're making some progress in physical therapy-",therapist
61,53,['C'],Yes.,client
61,54,['SR'],-and that you were hoping that the tai chi would help you with the wobblies. Uh-huh?,therapist
61,55,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,56,['CQ'],"And so, are you wanting to go back to tai chi?",therapist
61,57,['C'],"[sighs] Um, yes-yes I-I do because I-- my friend, I think I told you, really, really loves it and I just, I wish I could go back, and yes I do. I'm not making much sense, but I do.",client
61,58,['O'],"Uh-huh. I think it's important, um, that you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether or not tai chi works for you.",therapist
61,59,['N'],"Oh, I don't really know yet after just one time.",client
61,60,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,61,['N'],"Yeah. It's-it's-- I can't make that-- It wouldn't be fair for me to say it does or doesn't. It didn't that one time, but you know.",client
61,62,['CR'],"So, you haven't seen the results that you want yet-",therapist
61,63,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,64,['SR'],-but because Dr. Fields has recommended it and your friend has-,therapist
61,65,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,66,['CR'],-and it sounds like you like the instructor-,therapist
61,67,['N'],"Yeah, I do.",client
61,68,['CR'],-it sounds like you'd like to try and give it another chance?,therapist
61,69,['C'],"Yeah, I would.",client
61,70,['OQ'],"So, what has to happen in order for you to get to tai chi again?",therapist
61,71,['S'],"Well, I'd have to make the arrangements again, that was a little complicated, and, um, I'd have to get my head straight about feeling self-conscious, because I-I know that nobody's really looking at me, but I have to convince myself.",client
61,72,['O'],Uh-huh. Yeah.,therapist
61,73,['S'],"Yeah, and the arrangement, arrangements a little complicated.",client
61,74,['OQ'],"Uh-huh. So, how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being very confident that you can make the arrangements in order to get to tai chi.",therapist
61,75,['N'],That I can make the arrangement?,client
61,76,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
61,77,['N'],Five.,client
61,78,['SR'],Five.,therapist
61,79,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,80,['O'],"Uh-huh, so-",therapist
61,81,['S'],"I-I mean, I know I can, but it's really difficult.",client
61,82,['OQ'],"Uh-huh. What is it that makes it a five instead of a one, no confidence?",therapist
61,83,['C'],That I'm doing it by myself.,client
61,84,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
61,85,['C'],And I would really fe-- If I could have some sup-- Like if somebody could help me do it.,client
61,86,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,87,['S'],"My-my daughter can't visit that often and, um-",client
61,88,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,89,['N'],Yeah.,client
61,90,"['CQ', 'CR']","So, in order for you to feel more confident, you would like some help in making those arrangements?",therapist
61,91,['C'],I would.,client
61,92,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,93,['C'],I would.,client
61,94,['SR'],And is that something that your daughter can do for you?,therapist
61,95,['N'],"Well, she's-- she could, but I'd have to wait at least a week.",client
61,96,['CQ'],"Okay. Um, so is that something that you'd like us to help you with?",therapist
61,97,['C'],I would.,client
61,98,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
61,99,['C'],"Yeah, yeah. Is that possible?",client
61,100,['GI'],Sure we can make those arrangements with the rehab center. They have a van-,therapist
61,101,['N'],Uh-huh.,client
61,102,['GI'],-and-and they've done this for other patients so we can certainly make those arrangements if you'd like.,therapist
61,103,['C'],"That would- that would be good. And then as far as feeling self-confident, I'd have to do that myself.",client
61,104,['CQ'],"Okay. So, are there any other barriers or obstacles in the way to you getting to tai chi?",therapist
61,105,['C'],"Um, I can't think of any.",client
61,106,['O'],Okay.,therapist
61,107,['N'],That's-that's the main thing-,client
61,108,['O'],All right.,therapist
61,109,['N'],-the arrangements.,client
61,110,['CR'],"Well, it sounds like you can see that you're making some progress in your physical therapy.",therapist
61,111,['C'],Yes.,client
61,112,['SR'],"And that you're wanting to give tai chi another chance, and that if we can help make arrangements for you to get there with the van to the rehab center, that you'll give it another chance.",therapist
61,113,['C'],That's-- Yeah.,client
61,114,['O'],Okay.,therapist
61,115,['C'],That's true.,client
61,116,['O'],"Well, um, before you leave today, we'll go ahead and, um, I'll call the rehab center and make those arrangements.",therapist
61,117,['N'],You would?,client
61,118,['O'],Sure. I'm-I'm happy to do that.,therapist
61,119,['C'],That would really help.,client
61,120,['O'],"And then when you come back in, I know you've got another follow up appointment with Dr. Fields, I'd like to check back with you then and see how class went the second time.",therapist
61,121,['N'],Okay.,client
61,122,['O'],All right.,therapist
61,123,['N'],Yeah. Thank you.,client
61,124,['O'],"Well, thank you very much for coming in today Mrs. Smith and I look forward to hearing about the progress that you're making.",therapist
61,125,['N'],Okay.,client
62,0,['OQ'],-- doing today?,therapist
62,1,['N'],"I'm good, thanks.",client
62,2,['OQ'],Good. Why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since I saw you last?,therapist
62,3,['N'],"Um, I guess everything's fine. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do or something. I don't know.",client
62,4,['O'],Okay.,therapist
62,5,['N'],I'm not sure of that.,client
62,6,['SR'],"So she talked to you a little bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the details.",therapist
62,7,['N'],"Yeah, I know that she said I have to get so many hours in, but I don't- I don't know. I kind of was half-listening.",client
62,8,['OQ'],Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conversation with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?,therapist
62,9,['N'],"I know that I have to get it done by the end of my probation, except I forgot like how many hours or if I'm supposed to find it or someone else is gonna find it for me or I-I told you I'm confused.",client
62,10,['SR'],"Okay, gotcha. So, you know, that it needs to get done-",therapist
62,11,['SR'],"Yes.-you know, you have till the end of your probation-",therapist
62,12,['N'],Yes.,client
62,13,['SR'],-but you're a little fuzzy on the details.,therapist
62,14,['N'],"Exactly, yeah.",client
62,15,['O'],"Okay. Um, so maybe if it's okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a little bit more.",therapist
62,16,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
62,17,['O'],Is that all right?,therapist
62,18,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
62,19,"['CQ', 'OPTI']","Okay, great. Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?",therapist
62,20,['N'],"Um, yeah, I just, so I still have to find the community service hours myself?",client
62,21,['GI'],So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.,therapist
62,22,['N'],Okay.,client
62,23,['GI'],"So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-",therapist
62,24,['N'],Okay.,client
62,25,['GI'],"-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call.",therapist
62,26,['N'],Okay.,client
62,27,['GI'],"And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together.",therapist
62,28,['N'],"Okay, so I would do that. And then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in in like a weekend or how does that work?",client
62,29,['ADVI'],"Well, I mean, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time.",therapist
62,30,['N'],[unintelligible 00:02:20],client
62,31,['CR'],I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-,therapist
62,32,['N'],"Oh, yeah.",client
62,33,"['CQ', 'GI']","-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that sound like something that might be helpful for you?",therapist
62,34,['N'],"Yeah, I think, just to keep track of it better.",client
62,35,['O'],Okay.,therapist
62,36,['C'],I think it's a good idea.,client
62,37,['GI'],"And then, you know, it might be, I definitely think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could easily get done in a week.",therapist
62,38,['N'],Okay.,client
62,39,['O'],What other questions do you have for me about community service?,therapist
62,40,['C'],"I think that's it. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do it myself and that 25 hours has to be done. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done.",client
62,41,['O'],"Yup, absolutely.",therapist
62,42,['N'],Okay.,client
62,43,['GI'],"But you know that if you have any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we're here for- to be a support for you.",therapist
62,44,['N'],"All right, thank you.",client
62,45,['O'],You're welcome.,therapist
63,0,"['CQ', 'SR']","So Tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?",therapist
63,1,['N'],Definitely.,client
63,2,"['CQ', 'SR']",And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?,therapist
63,3,['N'],Okay.,client
63,4,"['OQ', 'SR']","Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?",therapist
63,5,['N'],I do some meth.,client
63,6,['OQ'],"Snort it, smoke it?",therapist
63,7,['N'],"Snort it, always snort it.",client
63,8,['SR'],Don't inject it?,therapist
63,9,['N'],Mm-mm.,client
63,10,['OQ'],Use any other drugs?,therapist
63,11,['N'],"Just, you know, some alcohol.",client
63,12,['CQ'],"And, uh, um, you do this how often?",therapist
63,13,['N'],Meth?,client
63,14,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
63,15,['N'],"Um, two, three times a month.",client
63,16,['SR'],So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?,therapist
63,17,['N'],Right.,client
63,18,"['CQ', 'SR']",Only snort it?,therapist
63,19,['N'],Right.,client
63,20,"['CQ', 'GI']","Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?",therapist
63,21,['C'],"Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high.",client
63,22,['SR'],So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?,therapist
63,23,['C'],"Definitely, yeah.",client
63,24,['CR'],And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?,therapist
63,25,['C'],Yeah.,client
63,26,['OQ'],Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?,therapist
63,27,['C'],"No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.",client
63,28,['ADVI'],"Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.",therapist
63,29,['S'],"I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.",client
63,30,['CR'],"So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?",therapist
63,31,['C'],"Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.",client
63,32,['OQ'],"Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-",therapist
63,33,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
63,34,['OQ'],-with zero being not ready at all-,therapist
63,35,['N'],Mm.,client
63,36,['OQ'],"-and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?",therapist
63,37,['S'],"Uh, three.",client
63,38,['OQ'],Why not a one or a two?,therapist
63,39,['C'],"I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two.",client
63,40,['OQ'],Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?,therapist
63,41,['C'],"Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes.",client
63,42,['CR'],"Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV.",therapist
63,43,['C'],Yeah.,client
63,44,['OQ'],"Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?",therapist
63,45,['C'],"Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life.",client
63,46,['OQ'],How could you get a different social life?,therapist
63,47,['S'],"It's the hard thing, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it.",client
63,48,['OQ'],Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?,therapist
63,49,['N'],My sister.,client
63,50,['CQ'],Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?,therapist
63,51,['C'],"I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help.",client
63,52,['CR'],"So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine.",therapist
63,53,['N'],Yes.,client
63,54,['SR'],And there's some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your sister and getting some support.,therapist
63,55,['C'],Yes.,client
63,56,['ADVI'],"Well, great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you.",therapist
63,57,['N'],Okay.,client
63,58,['CQ'],I could see you again in a month. Would that work out for you?,therapist
63,59,['N'],"Yeah, sure.",client
64,0,['O'],"Well, welcome, Ricky.",therapist
64,1,['N'],Thank you.,client
64,2,['O'],Nice to meet you.,therapist
64,3,['N'],"Yeah, you too.",client
64,4,['CQ'],And you found us okay?,therapist
64,5,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",client
64,6,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,7,['N'],Yeah. Yeah. pretty straightforward-,client
64,8,['O'],Yeah,therapist
64,9,['N'],-always good.,client
64,10,['CQ'],Have you been here before?,therapist
64,11,['N'],"No. No, not at all.",client
64,12,['O'],"Mm. Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a little about why you're here today-",therapist
64,13,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,14,['OQ'],"-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.",therapist
64,15,['C'],"Sure. Um, I guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago, I had sort of like this group of friends come around to my place, and um, you know, they-they were sort of saying that it was just like a night to hang out and watch DVDs and stuff, and then they sort of sat me down and were like, ""You know, maybe you need to get a bit of help for, you know, drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was sort of like, ""Well, mm."" And I was quite annoyed by that at first, but I-I suppose, you know, I thought about it for a bit and then I was like, ""Well, I guess it can't hurt to talk to someone about it, maybe.""",client
64,16,['O'],Right.,therapist
64,17,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,18,['CQ'],And that's led you to being here today?,therapist
64,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,20,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,21,['C'],"Yeah. I just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll—",client
64,22,['CQ'],"Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?",therapist
64,23,['C'],"Yeah, I guess. I-I suppose I hadn't really thought about it till they sat me down, and you know- I mean I could, uh, I could understand a little bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, I thought I'd—",client
64,24,['CQ'],They were concerned for you?,therapist
64,25,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,26,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,27,['C'],"Yeah. Yeah, which kind of was a bit of a sh-shock, I suppose.",client
64,28,['CQ'],You were surprised?,therapist
64,29,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I don't know. You know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or say, ""You know, you need to go and get help."" And then-- I don't know. Like you know those characters and, they-they do need help, you know-",client
64,30,['O'],Yep.,therapist
64,31,['N'],-because they're fucked.,client
64,32,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,33,['C'],"And you kind of go, ""Woah. That's not me."" So it's about am I—",client
64,34,['CQ'],You're not sure that applies to you?,therapist
64,35,['S'],"Yeah, or well, not to that extent, you know what I mean? Like, I-I would-- l didn't think I was at anywhere near a point that I would need to be sat down and intervened with-",client
64,36,['O'],Okay.,therapist
64,37,['N'],-if you know what I mean.,client
64,38,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,39,['N'],I suppose.,client
64,40,['SR'],"I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-",therapist
64,41,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,42,['CQ'],-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how bad it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?,therapist
64,43,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you know, they are my friends and-",client
64,44,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,45,['C'],"- you know, I'm not gonna be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong 'cause there's a big group of them, you know? And they do care, so obviously, there's something there that I might have overlooked. But on the other hand, I'm sort of like, ""Well, was it that bad?"" And you know, ""Was that- was that really necessary?"" But I, you know, I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and-",client
64,46,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
64,47,['C'],"-and just check it up, yep.",client
64,48,['CQ'],"Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?",therapist
64,49,['N'],"Yeah, pretty right.",client
64,50,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,51,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,52,['GI'],"Well, let's do some checking out.",therapist
64,53,['N'],"Okay, cool.",client
64,54,['GI'],"So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.",therapist
64,55,['N'],"Um, dr-drugs, I guess.",client
64,56,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,57,['N'],"Mm, yeah. Sort of kind of do a bit of P now and again-",client
64,58,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,59,['N'],"-and, um, I guess less often, I do a bit of, you know, I smoke a little bit and, um, party pills in the- in the weekend sometimes.",client
64,60,['O'],Okay.,therapist
64,61,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,62,['OQ'],"Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.",therapist
64,63,['N'],"Um, a couple of times a week maybe.",client
64,64,['CQ'],"Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?",therapist
64,65,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
64,66,['CQ'],This is meth you're talking about? A couple of times a week?,therapist
64,67,['C'],"Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know what I mean?",client
64,68,['OQ'],"Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?",therapist
64,69,['N'],"Right. Um, I suppose it's kind of hand-in-hand with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that I've-- Like, um, I moved to Auckland maybe three years ago.",client
64,70,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,71,['N'],"And, um, I still live in Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there. And, um, kind of just when I first got here I was sorta introduced a little bit to, um, like do you know Family Bar on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?",client
64,72,['O'],"I know Family Bar, yes.",therapist
64,73,['S'],"Yeah. It's that sort of- that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I guess. And, like, it's not something I'd really thought about before and-- But then kinda hung out there and just met these people that were sort of like you don't really get there much Palmy. Well, I mean I suppose you do, but they're not-- You know, in Auckland bars like that you can just-- Uh, you can just be it out in the open, you know, and I suppose in Palmy you can't as easily. Um, so just to arrive and see that and kind of meet these people that were just really friendly, you know, and-and not judge me into it. I don't know. You know, Palmy often is they're sort of like, ""Oh, you've gotta own a car, and soap it up, and drive up and down the Main Street,"" and I just couldn't give a shit about that, you know, so. Or play rugby and, you know, that didn't interest me at all and sorta come here and have people, you know, talk about interesting stuff and have a good time. I just want to go out and dance and stuff like that. Um, that was quite cool for me to know that that existed because I hadn't seen that before and-and I suppose there's a lot of that that goes on there, you know?",client
64,74,['S'],"It's quite a heavy party scene most weekends and stuff. So it kind of goes hand in hand with that really, and just, you know, I guess when I have-have a slight-- I don't know, you just feel really good, I guess. Just feel, like, happy, and excited, and just to be surrounded by people that, you know, really care about you, and love you and-- Coming from a place where y-you didn't-- don't get that as much, it's just really cool, you know, to-to be able to go, ""Okay, on this day I can take this."" And it's just that instant, like, ""I know- I know I'll feel good."" I guess that's part of it.",client
64,75,['CQ'],"So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?",therapist
64,76,['N'],"Yeah, in-in a way. Although I wouldn't have been conscious of that really. I just sort of discovered it here. It's not like I came to Auckland looking for that kinda-",client
64,77,['O'],Right.,therapist
64,78,['N'],"-lift to get away from, um, you know parents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, that Palmy sort of lifestyle. But then yeah, I discovered this other thing, um—",client
64,79,['CQ'],Which you weren't aware of in Palmerston?,therapist
64,80,['N'],No.,client
64,81,['O'],Okay.,therapist
64,82,['N'],"No. I didn't really know. I guess you see sort of things like that in-in movies from America you know, but you don't really-",client
64,83,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,84,['N'],"- think that it would exist in your own country. Well, not if you grew up in Palmy.",client
64,85,['SR'],Palmerston. Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,86,['N'],"Um, I don't mean to be mean about Palmy but, you know, it's just the different kinda attitude, I guess, kinda- this done-",client
64,87,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
64,88,['N'],-to that sort of thing.,client
64,89,['SR'],It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.,therapist
64,90,['N'],Yes-,client
64,91,['SR'],And-and you came-,therapist
64,92,['N'],-plus-,client
64,93,['SR'],-here to Auckland.,therapist
64,94,['S'],"Yeah, yeah. I definitely wanted to get away from something. I didn't know what too, but then I arrived here and found this thing that was like actually, this was obviously, fate or whatever was pulling me to this thing-",client
64,95,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,96,['S'],-'cause-'cause like I found something in myself or something that was missing.,client
64,97,['OQ'],And how does that feel for you now?,therapist
64,98,['N'],"Um, now, I guess, now, I'm just a little used to it. [clears throat] When I first got here, I was like, ""Wow, this is amazing."" This is hard, I guess, but, you know, it's been three years now, so it's just kinda like I've gotten used to it.",client
64,99,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,100,['N'],"I mean, I guess, I'm, let's say I take it for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. And, um, it's just a sort of what I do really. Yeah, so, I guess that the drugs are linked to that, I suppose. It's j-- Well, it's just a part of it, I don't really think-- I didn't really differentiate it. It's just kinda, ""Okay, I'm gonna go hang with my friends,"" and that sort of thing, you know, that Saturday, Friday night thing. And then it just happens really as part of that.",client
64,101,['CR'],"So coming out, feeling-- being gay-",therapist
64,102,['N'],Yep.,client
64,103,['CR'],"-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-",therapist
64,104,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,105,['CQ'],-for you?,therapist
64,106,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,107,['CQ'],"And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?",therapist
64,108,['N'],Yep.,client
64,109,['CQ'],And you're not experiencing where these two things are separate? They just seem to be together more often than not?,therapist
64,110,['C'],"Well, I guess, now, that I think about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice that.",client
64,111,['O'],So—,therapist
64,112,['N'],"I mean like I always-- Well, it's, you know it's kind of a thing that happens in the weekends but, I guess, sometimes in the weekdays. You know, I'll-I'll pretty much every weekend I'll have a big night, um, maybe two but sometimes, you know, in the weekdays like on a Tuesday or Wednesday or something if I just kinda feel like doing something then I might do that sometimes to see if someone else wants to come round and join me or, you know, occasionally by myself I might have a smoke by myself or something like that. And I guess that isn't entirely linked to that scene, I suppose.",client
64,113,['CR'],It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.,therapist
64,114,['N'],Mm. Maybe. I suppose I hadn't really thought about it-,client
64,115,['O'],Okay.,therapist
64,116,['N'],-until recently.,client
64,117,['CQ'],So something's changed recently?,therapist
64,118,['N'],Yeah. I suppose just since that kind of intervention thing or I started to give them the benefit of the doubt. And it's-,client
64,119,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
64,120,['N'],-maybe noticing some things that I hadn't noticed but—,client
64,121,['OQ'],Tell me about those things you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.,therapist
64,122,['N'],"Oh, I mean, e-even just now, you know, when you asked me how often.",client
64,123,['OQ'],That surprised you?,therapist
64,124,['C'],"Mm. S-surprised me to-to think about, you know, when there's stuff, and you don't really think about it, but then if someone asked you, you know, how often or-- and then you kind of have to quantify it, I suppose it kinda sound shocking, you know, if I- if I imagine myself sort of saying, ""I do this, you know, a few times a week."" It-it-",client
64,125,['O'],Mm.,therapist
64,126,['S'],"-sounds shocking. But to me it-it's- it doesn't feel that way, you know, that's kind of where that, where it kind of doesn't sit right. I, [clears throat] that's why I kind of got a bit miffed at my friends a little bit, or I dunno, a bit defensive there. 'Cause you know, it sounds a lot, but it doesn't feel out of control or anything, you know. It doesn't feel, I dunno, people that need to go and see therapists or whatever you kind of go, ""Oh, they're an addict."" You know. They-- Their health is really bad and they need urgent help right now quickly, Uh, well, at least that's kind of the-the feeling you get. And I don't feel that at all. I don't feel like it's a real urgent thing. So that-",client
64,127,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,128,['N'],-felt a bit weird.,client
64,129,['O'],Okay.,therapist
64,130,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,131,['CR'],"So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet—",therapist
64,132,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,133,['O'],Okay.,therapist
64,134,['N'],Definitely.,client
64,135,['OQ'],"So tell me then, um, Ricky, what- what's the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is there a downside to it? Are there problems that you're experiencing?",therapist
64,136,['C'],"Yep. Um. Uh, I suppose money is quite a big thing. Like, I used to have a lot more money sorta last year. I had a, quite a good job, like a, quite a regular acting job.",client
64,137,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
64,138,['C'],"Um, and it was like quite a lot of money that la-last year. So it wasn't such a problem then. And I suppose I sort of blew that money a little bit. Um, so now I don't have that acting income coming in as frequently and I'm working in a cafe like a sort of part-time and it's not bringing in as much. So now it's kinda like, and sometimes I need to borrow a bit of money or sorta need a bit of help with the rent sometimes.",client
64,139,['CR'],Quite a lot's changed over the last year from—,therapist
64,140,['N'],Yeah. Yeah. A little bit.,client
64,141,['CR'],It doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.,therapist
64,142,['N'],"No. But you know, that's the life of an actor, I suppose, ups and downs works and not works.",client
64,143,['SR'],Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession-,therapist
64,144,['N'],No.,client
64,145,['CR'],-and it's-it's hard-,therapist
64,146,['N'],It's not.,client
64,147,['CQ'],"-it's hard. But is-is there, I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?",therapist
64,148,['C'],Hmm. Could have been a couple of auditions that I didn't do so well and as I could have 'cause of that.,client
64,149,['CQ'],The drug may have had an effect on that?,therapist
64,150,['N'],"Uh, maybe. Maybe it's just my general sort of state. Um,I dunno, sometimes I suppose just kind of weighs on my mind a little bit like, ""What am I doing or why am I spending my money on this?"" I mean, when it's happening, it's like, this is amazing.",client
64,151,['O'],Hmm. Hmm.,therapist
64,152,['C'],"You know am I-- You go in- you go into places, interesting places, but you know, I could just as well have saved that money and actually gone to interesting places I suppose. But I don't know. I wonder if it- if-if it's having an effect. I-I don't know. I can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so good for the face, I dunno. [crosstalk] Dunno if I look tired or-or run down or-",client
64,153,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,154,['C'],"-or if I actually am tired or run down, I suppose. Again, this is things that I haven't really thought about-",client
64,155,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,156,['C'],-but now I'm starting to think about.,client
64,157,['SR'],Right. And they got questions too-,therapist
64,158,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,159,['O'],-to ask are they—,therapist
64,160,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,161,['SR'],You're beginning to-to think about those things and-and-and what effect they may have on you.,therapist
64,162,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,163,['SR'],And the choices that you might have about it.,therapist
64,164,['N'],Yeah. Hmm.,client
64,165,['OQ'],"What else? Are the-the-the-the problem of around the use of money, you know, the choices that you make around money, and the meth use has taken up quite a lot of the money-",therapist
64,166,['N'],Yep.,client
64,167,['SR'],"-over the last year and maybe also the effect on-on um, your job and being able-- maybe you're not auditioning as well as you might.",therapist
64,168,['N'],Yep.,client
64,169,['SR'],"And maybe the effects um, also on-on your physical appearance. An interesting question around the effect of meth use on physical appearance.",therapist
64,170,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
64,171,['OQ'],"Um, what-- are there any other problems? Any other things that-that are a bit of a downside to this?",therapist
64,172,['C'],"Uh, I guess it's obviously having some sort of effect on my friends and my flatmates, 'cause, you know, they set me down and said, ""Look you gotta-",client
64,173,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
64,174,['C'],"-look into this or else we can't hang out anymore.""",client
64,175,['CQ'],And that's a problem?,therapist
64,176,['C'],"That would be a problem, yeah.",client
64,177,['OQ'],Why?,therapist
64,178,['C'],"If they didn't wanna hang out, well, then what have I got, I suppose?",client
64,179,['SR'],They're important.,therapist
64,180,['S'],"Yeah. Yeah, and I mean part of it, yeah. Part of it I just wonder 'cause, you know, a lot of those friends that set me down are obviously the ones that are not part of that scene. I mean there were a couple there that-that are, but mostly they were the ones that sort of have always sorta been a bit judgy. You know, like when I first started all this stuff, you know. And clearly, there wasn't a problem like-- 'cause I used to be that guy as well you know, like, ""No never do that 'cause it's bad,"" and then you try it the first time and you go, ""Actually, it's not that bad."" It's not the end of the world if you're sensible with it, then it's not gonna be, you know.",client
64,181,['S'],"You have to take a stupid amount to do any kind of like, or, you know, to die or to end up in a hospital.",client
64,182,['O'],YHmm.,therapist
64,183,['N'],"So it's provided you don't-- you're not stupid with it. Then it's just a bit of fun but you can't really explain that to people who are-- have their walls up. So it's hard not to sit in this room full of people kind of going, ""Oh, you know, you really should stop the drugs, they're bad."" It's like, ""Well actually, you don't know what you're talking about.""",client
64,184,['CQ'],"Hmm. But Ricky, let me just check, 'cause I may got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some friends that you've got who do use who are still concerned about you. Did I get that right from what you said earlier that-that those who are concerned about you and were part of this intervention some of them use.",therapist
64,185,['N'],"Yep. Yeah, a couple.",client
64,186,['CR'],And you-- So they have their concerns and-and you are beginning to-to ask questions of this use as well and-,therapist
64,187,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,188,['GI'],-it's just that that we're gonna try and drill down a little more into just to pick up for you what-what you think might be going on and what you think might be some of the options for you.,therapist
64,189,['N'],Yep.,client
64,190,['GI'],"And we're g- we're gonna leave labels all that kind of stuff aside 'cause, you know, I'm picking up from you that that's not what that's about.",therapist
64,191,['N'],Yep.,client
64,192,['OQ'],"I'm happy with that. What do you think will happen, what might happen if you can turn your-your uses- you're on now? What-what concerns do you have about not making any kind of change?",therapist
64,193,['C'],"Um, well I suppose the acting thing is a really big concern.",client
64,194,['O'],Alright.,therapist
64,195,['C'],"'Cause I want that to be my job, you know. I'm fucking sick of cafes.",client
64,196,['SR'],This is gonna be your career. This is the career-,therapist
64,197,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,198,['SR'],-you want to make.,therapist
64,199,['N'],"I'd like it to be, yeah.",client
64,200,['GI'],"Mm-hmm. It's harder when you're trying to create your career, get that going. You gotta- you gotta be at your- at your top, top pitch.",therapist
64,201,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,202,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
64,203,['N'],"Yeah, 'cause I mean it's all you know, it's partly lacking and partly being at the right place at the right time. And if you're at the right place and at the right time and it is not on your game then there could have been a—",client
64,204,['CR'],"Yeah, and-and maybe the meth use is-is compromising that.",therapist
64,205,['C'],"Yeah, it could be.",client
64,206,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
64,207,['C'],"Yeah, and then I suppose also like money is linked into that as well, you know, I've-- I'm not doing as many courses and stuff as I used to be doing, 'cause it's, you know, don't have the money.",client
64,208,['SR'],"Alright, so it's back to the money thing again which is-",therapist
64,209,['C'],"Well, yeah, I mean, obviously I don't wanna keep pissing my flatmates off.",client
64,210,['O'],Yeah. yeah.,therapist
64,211,['C'],"You know, and it's not- it's not cool to not pay the rent, obviously. It's not something I'm happy with.",client
64,212,['CQ'],That creates problems?,therapist
64,213,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,214,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
64,215,['C'],"Yeah, and I don't wanna be that person.",client
64,216,['CQ'],"Let's just come back to another thing, uh, that we were talking about a little bit earlier, and it's around your meth use as well and-and-and with your gay friends, with gay lifestyle. And-and that sounds like you're saying that-that-that when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you're being with friends that the meth use is always there?",therapist
64,217,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,218,['SR'],The-the availability of it is there.,therapist
64,219,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,220,['O'],"And everyone, most people are using.",therapist
64,221,['S'],"Yeah. Not-not necessarily P or whatever but yeah most people are doing something. Yeah. I suppose yeah it's kind of part of that scene that there's not a huge like, you know, you go to normal bars and most people are just drunk and wasted and like spewing everywhere and stuff and whereas that's a different scene. Like, people drink but they don't drink to that excess but they take other things and have a good time. And, yeah.",client
64,222,['CQ'],And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not to be using drugs?,therapist
64,223,['N'],"Yeah. I mean there are people that do that. I suppose it-it would be hard. I-I haven't really thought about it, I suppose. That's all it is, all I've known that scene to be, you know, 'cause I'm quite new to it, you know-",client
64,224,['O'],Right.,therapist
64,225,['N'],-so from the beginning it was always there.,client
64,226,['SR'],So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-,therapist
64,227,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,228,['CQ'],-or particularly on-on meth use?,therapist
64,229,['N'],"Oh yeah, well, they must be. I can't imagine everyone is there, I guess just the ma-majority or at least p-- the majority of people that I know, yeah.",client
64,230,['GI'],"So that might be something that we can look at but later if you're interested in is maybe what are some of those other parts of the gay scene, whose still party and party medley, but when meth is not a- is not a dominant-",therapist
64,231,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,232,['OPTI'],"-factor in that partying, and we- where-where there are, uh, uh, uh, gay groups that support people who-who are not wanting to be-- they have a lifestyle that is heavily weighted to drug use. So there are some options there to look at some other ideas if you're interested and we might look at that, for you to think about-",therapist
64,233,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,234,['CR'],"-to consider, so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about huge major changes, it's about how can I improve the situation.",therapist
64,235,['N'],Yep. Yeah.,client
64,236,['CR'],It's what I'm hearing you saying bring-- be a little bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.,therapist
64,237,['N'],Yep.,client
64,238,['SR'],So that I can pursue that plan.,therapist
64,239,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
64,240,['OQ'],What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?,therapist
64,241,['C'],"Well, [coughs] I must say I was a bit, um, you know, at the start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often I do it and then I found myself talking about the kind of the weekday stuff I kinda took myself back a bit there. I suppose, you know, on a Wednesday by yourself like it doesn't sound that good.",client
64,242,['CQ'],"So that needs some thinking about, doesn't it?",therapist
64,243,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,244,['OQ'],As to what-,therapist
64,245,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,246,['OQ'],-what would work for you-,therapist
64,247,['N'],Mm.,client
64,248,['OQ'],-as an alternative.,therapist
64,249,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah, but I think you're right about, just something to look forward to, because it's that midweek slump, you know. So far away till people will be in their place where they can-",client
64,250,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
64,251,['N'],-hang out and have a good time.,client
64,252,['SR'],"Yeah. Yeah. And there are things that have gotta work for you, so that-",therapist
64,253,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,254,['CQ'],"-that's your ideas on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to know what they are.",therapist
64,255,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,256,['GI'],Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all kinds of things that meet through the week.,therapist
64,257,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,258,['GI'],"And so, though they're not going to be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-",therapist
64,259,['N'],Yeah.,client
64,260,['GI'],"-you know, good to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look.""",therapist
64,261,['N'],Yeah. Yep.,client
65,0,['N'],"Many people have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight.",client
65,1,['O'],Mm.,therapist
65,2,['N'],"Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-",client
65,3,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,4,['N'],-if you quit smoking.,client
65,5,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,6,['S'],Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.,client
65,7,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,8,['S'],"That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it.",client
65,9,['CR'],Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.,therapist
65,10,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
65,11,['CR'],It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.,therapist
65,12,['N'],Right.,client
65,13,['CR'],"Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.",therapist
65,14,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
65,15,['OQ'],I'm wondering what else might be on that list.,therapist
65,16,['S'],"Um, withdrawal.",client
65,17,['O'],Mm.,therapist
65,18,['S'],"They say it's awful. Um, being cranky.",client
65,19,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,20,['N'],"And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do.",client
65,21,['SR'],Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-,therapist
65,22,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
65,23,"['OQ', 'SR']","-the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?",therapist
65,24,['S'],"Um, I think everything's on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine-",client
65,25,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,26,['S'],-not- going through life without smoking.,client
65,27,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,28,['C'],"I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes-",client
65,29,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,30,['C'],"-at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-",client
65,31,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
65,32,['N'],-that made me rethink-,client
65,33,['O'],Mm.,therapist
65,34,['N'],-everything.,client
66,0,['O'],"Hi, Mr. Stowe.",therapist
66,1,['N'],Hey.,client
66,2,['OQ'],How are you doing today? I'm Bruce Berger.,therapist
66,3,['N'],Pleasure to meet you.,client
66,4,['GI'],"I, uh, I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes.",therapist
66,5,"['C', 'S']","Yeah. I'm supposed to learn how to manage it. I just learned that I got diabetes and apparently, it's pretty bad 'cause, uh, she said my blood sugar was sky high, and then she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen. That just sounds so disastrous and, uh, and then she told me I gotta do all this stuff. And man, I'm just sort of disappointed right now.",client
66,6,['CR'],"So you just- you just saw the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen with your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things.",therapist
66,7,"['C', 'N']",She mentioned my legs having troubles and-,client
66,8,['CR'],"And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually.",therapist
66,9,['S'],"Well, that's, yeah. It's not just being scared, you know. I don't want that to happen to me, but then when I, when-when she reels off all these things I gotta do and I'm sort of going oh, oh, you know, I'm not certain I can even get it done. So it's sort of sitting-- well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking that, oh my God, this is- this is what's gonna happen to me.",client
66,10,['O'],So it sounds like-,therapist
66,11,['S'],"And it is discouraging, just like discouraging.",client
66,12,['CR'],"So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.",therapist
66,13,['S'],"Yeah. It looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle. And then, yeah, all this horrible stuff happens to me. I mean, it's- it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse.",client
66,14,['GI'],"Okay. And I-- And what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. I, you know, on the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very high and we do wanna get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. Uh, and-and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to-to get your blood sugar down. Um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming.",therapist
66,15,['OQ'],"And I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now. You know, for example, there- there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as prescribed. And honestly, if I was gonna work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that-that first, because that'll have the biggest impact. How-how does that sound so far?",therapist
66,16,['C'],"Well, I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my blood sugar is really high. and-",client
66,17,['SR'],So that's easy to do.,therapist
66,18,['C'],"Yeah, I'm pretty- I'm pretty good at taking drugs.",client
66,19,['SR'],"Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now.",therapist
66,20,['C'],Yeah. I think I could probably do that.,client
66,21,['ADVI'],"Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh.",therapist
66,22,['S'],"Well, she also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar and all this. And that just seemed like a lot of mumbo jambo to me.",client
66,23,['GI'],Yeah. And that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task.,therapist
66,24,['N'],"Oh, okay.",client
66,25,['OQ'],"So it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine, when you're changing your eating habits, that it's really having an impact on your blood sugar 'cause getting your blood sugar down is going to keep you from having all of those other problems. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling?",therapist
66,26,['C'],"Well, I like it that I, you know, that-that we can do it at a step at a time. I mean, that's-- that relieves some pressure.",client
66,27,['O'],Okay.,therapist
66,28,['C'],"And being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than-- I-I wasn't certain I could just, wham, put this huge program in[chuckles] into effect. Uh, but doing a step at a time and I, you know, that-- getting on the medicine, I don't think that's any big problem. That I can do I am pretty sure.",client
66,29,['CR'],It sounds like you're very committed to that.,therapist
66,30,['C'],"Yeah. I think I could do that. Uh, as long as there's no big-time side effects, but, uh-",client
67,0,['OQ'],Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? We give this out to everybody who comes in.,therapist
67,1,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
67,2,['GI'],"All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.",therapist
67,3,['N'],Something like that.,client
67,4,['OQ'],"Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?",therapist
67,5,['N'],"Uh, I vape. I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though.",client
67,6,['OQ'],Okay. How often?,therapist
67,7,['N'],"Um, a few times a month.",client
67,8,['OQ'],Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?,therapist
67,9,['N'],"I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me.",client
67,10,['OQ'],Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you?,therapist
67,11,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
67,12,"['GI', 'OQ']","We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared?",therapist
67,13,['N'],"Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me.",client
67,14,['OQ'],How do you think it affects you?,therapist
67,15,['N'],"Um, I don't know. It makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my friend.",client
67,16,['OQ'],"Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?",therapist
67,17,['N'],"Well, I don't want to get in trouble like at school.",client
67,18,['OQ'],How could you get in trouble at school?,therapist
67,19,['N'],"Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team.",client
67,20,['OQ'],So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?,therapist
67,21,['N'],Right.,client
67,22,['OQ'],"So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?",therapist
67,23,['N'],"well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season start.",client
67,24,['OQ'],What would be the benefits of that?,therapist
67,25,['N'],"Well, I play better when I'm not high.",client
67,26,['OQ'],Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?,therapist
67,27,['C'],"Well, I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team.",client
67,28,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?",therapist
67,29,['C'],For about a month.,client
67,30,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?",therapist
67,31,['C'],"Um, seven.",client
67,32,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five?,therapist
67,33,['C'],"Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. I want to play well.",client
67,34,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?",therapist
67,35,['N'],"Uh, I don't know.",client
67,36,['OQ'],How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?,therapist
67,37,['C'],"Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape.",client
67,38,['OQ'],What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?,therapist
67,39,['C'],"Hmm, I like to play video games.",client
67,40,['OQ'],Anything else?,therapist
67,41,['C'],I can play basketball with my friend Sarah.,client
67,42,['SR'],Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.,therapist
67,43,['C'],Yeah.,client
67,44,"['NEGO', 'SR']","Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out.",therapist
67,45,['C'],Mm-hmm.,client
67,46,['O'],"Well, Good luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday, and it's always good to see you.",therapist
68,0,['O'],"Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.",therapist
68,1,['N'],Hi. Thank you.,client
68,2,['O'],So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself.,therapist
68,3,['N'],Okay.,client
68,4,['GI'],"Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward.",therapist
68,5,['N'],Okay.,client
68,6,['CQ'],Does that sound okay?,therapist
68,7,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,8,['OQ'],All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?,therapist
68,9,['N'],"Sure. Um, as you know, I'm Andrea, I, uh, I'm a junior I'm in the marching band. I play the tenor sax.",client
68,10,['O'],"Oh, neat.",therapist
68,11,['N'],"Yeah, I'm also in the-- I'm a bit of a band geek. [laughter] I play, you know, in the wind ensemble and the jazz band, things like that.",client
68,12,['SR'],Wow. You really are involved in music.,therapist
68,13,['N'],"Yeah, [crosstalk].",client
68,14,['CQ'],When did you start?,therapist
68,15,['N'],"Oh, I started playing about 10 years ago, actually.",client
68,16,['O'],Wow.,therapist
68,17,['N'],"Yeah, I started on the violin first, and then I went on, explored a little with the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and yeah.",client
68,18,['OQ'],"Very cool. I've always wanted to be good at music. [laughter] All right. So it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun?",therapist
68,19,['N'],"Um, you know, just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach, things like that.",client
68,20,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,21,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,22,['CQ'],Just kind of everyday sort of stuff?,therapist
68,23,['N'],Yeah [laughs].,client
68,24,['OQ'],Okay. Tell me a little bit about your family.,therapist
68,25,['N'],"Uh, well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old- years older than me. My parents, and I have a dog [laughs].",client
68,26,['CQ'],Cute. What kind of dog?,therapist
68,27,['N'],He's a Golden Retriever.,client
68,28,['O'],"Oh, nice. Okay.",therapist
68,29,['N'],My big boy.,client
68,30,['OQ'],[laughs] Very fun. All right. And how are things going in school for you?,therapist
68,31,['N'],They're pretty good. Grades have been pretty all right. Still like 3.7 ish.,client
68,32,['OQ'],"Okay, great, so you're doing well. What sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?",therapist
68,33,['C'],"Uh, I'd like to, you know, I'd like to, of course, graduate high school, hopefully, go to a nice Ivy League school.",client
68,34,['O'],"Oh, all right.",therapist
68,35,['C'],"But I mean, that might not happen. And then I'd like to go on and become a doctor. Study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something.",client
68,36,['SR'],"Okay, you have some pretty big dreams.",therapist
68,37,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,38,['O'],That's great. That's really exciting to think about that-,therapist
68,39,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,40,['GI'],"-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life. Whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. So here's the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that, um, might be more or less important to certain people.",therapist
68,41,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
68,42,['GI'],"Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?",therapist
68,43,['N'],"Um, I think a sense of community and belonging.",client
68,44,['O'],Okay.,therapist
68,45,['N'],"I think those two and, um, respect.",client
68,46,"['OQ', 'SR']","Respect, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?",therapist
68,47,['N'],"Yeah. Well, I think community and belonging, I kind of related them. Um, you know how I said I was in the marching band?",client
68,48,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,49,['N'],"I really, you know, I really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working toward- together towards that one goal.",client
68,50,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,51,['N'],"And then in terms of respect, I-I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. Like, I-I really do think respect is important, to respect myself and respect those around me, so.",client
68,52,['O'],Okay.,therapist
68,53,['N'],I place great importance in that.,client
68,54,['SR'],"Okay, great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, uh, belonging, like you said.",therapist
68,55,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
68,56,['CR'],And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.,therapist
68,57,['N'],"Yes, purpose.",client
68,58,['SR'],And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.,therapist
68,59,['N'],Yes.,client
68,60,['CR'],"Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great.",therapist
68,61,['N'],"Definitely, that's right.",client
68,62,['OQ'],"All right. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?",therapist
68,63,['N'],"Um, sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go to the beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some good board games and hang out.",client
68,64,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?",therapist
68,65,['N'],"Yeah, sometimes.",client
68,66,['OQ'],Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?,therapist
68,67,['N'],"Uh, well it's mostly just for, for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up as they say.",client
68,68,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?",therapist
68,69,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,70,['CQ'],Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?,therapist
68,71,['N'],"I'd say, um, on a not busy month, for instance, I'd say about like two weekends out of the month. Two or three.",client
68,72,['OQ'],Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?,therapist
68,73,['N'],"The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. And then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie it's not yeah.",client
68,74,['CQ'],"So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?",therapist
68,75,['N'],Definitely.,client
68,76,['CQ'],Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?,therapist
68,77,['N'],"Um, I think of them as-as different, I think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing.",client
68,78,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,79,['N'],So it's nice to have like that kind of breather-,client
68,80,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
68,81,['C'],"-versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's, uh, after it all, it's very draining.",client
68,82,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,83,['S'],But in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have fun.,client
68,84,['CQ'],Okay. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?,therapist
68,85,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,86,['OQ'],Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?,therapist
68,87,['S'],"Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed-",client
68,88,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,89,['C'],"-and not really thinking about stresses or things like that, but it can be--When it's too much drinking, it can be- can be obviously bad.",client
68,90,['OQ'],"Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?",therapist
68,91,['C'],"Um, a lot of times, it'll make- it'll make people stupid. [laughs] Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. We-we usually try to be as safe about it",client
68,92,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,93,['N'],"-as possible. So we'll like sleep over at a friend's house. And so that, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.",client
68,94,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,95,['C'],"But, um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stup- when they're drunk and can be really stupid.",client
68,96,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm. So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?",therapist
68,97,['N'],Yeah,client
68,98,['SR'],"You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time.",therapist
68,99,['N'],Sometimes. Yeah.,client
68,100,['OQ'],Can you tell me a little bit about that?,therapist
68,101,['C'],"Well, I, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that, that I don't- that's not fun.",client
68,102,['SR'],Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.,therapist
68,103,['C'],It's not.,client
68,104,['CQ'],And how often do you think that happens?,therapist
68,105,['C'],"For me, that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drunk and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me",client
68,106,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,107,['C'],-and that didn't end well.,client
68,108,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,109,['C'],"But after that, I haven't- but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and-",client
68,110,['O'],Okay.,therapist
68,111,['C'],It kind of puts a downer on my- on my fun.,client
68,112,['SR'],"Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved-",therapist
68,113,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,114,"['OQ', 'SR']","-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about the alcohol?",therapist
68,115,['C'],"Yeah. People can get a little like sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with people in corners doing things that should be done in private-",client
68,116,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,117,['N'],-and that kind of stuff.,client
68,118,['SR'],So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.,therapist
68,119,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,120,"['OQ', 'SR']","Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?",therapist
68,121,['C'],"I just- I've, you know, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue-",client
68,122,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,123,['C'],"So, I, you know, I wanna be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like in someone's house or sort of my parents will tell me something. But-- So, I- like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I wanna limit that.",client
68,124,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,125,['N'],And so be where I have fun.,client
68,126,['CR'],"Okay. Yeah, it sounds kinda similar to your, um, your value of respect to yourself.",therapist
68,127,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,128,['CR'],"On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.",therapist
68,129,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
68,130,['SR'],"If there's too much, then it sort of—",therapist
68,131,['C'],Then it kind of defeats the purpose? [laughs],client
68,132,['CR'],"Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.",therapist
68,133,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,134,['OQ'],"Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?",therapist
68,135,['N'],In terms of what? In terms of respect?,client
68,136,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,137,['C'],"I think, well in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things- I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there.",client
68,138,['O'],Okay.,therapist
68,139,['S'],"And then-- But in terms of at- how it is I am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blackout like throwing up and everything.",client
68,140,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,141,['N'],"And try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not gonna go somewhere with a person I met-",client
68,142,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,143,['N'],"-into I don't know where to, I don't know what, and-",client
68,144,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,145,['N'],-things like that.,client
68,146,['SR'],Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-,therapist
68,147,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,148,['SR'],-of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over.,therapist
68,149,['CQ'],Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?,therapist
68,150,['N'],"I usually-- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So in that way I control how much I drink. So, I usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, ""All right, this is my one drink"" and I'm good in that way. I still have something in my cup so people aren't gonna be like, ""Oh, here. Have some more."" I'd be like, ""No, I'm good. I have mine,"" and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little.",client
68,151,['CQ'],Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?,therapist
68,152,['C'],"For the most part, it works pretty well because, like I said, people, you know, people come asking me, trying to pressure me, I'll be like, ""No, I'm good. I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later."" And I never end up getting anything. Oh, but sometimes they'll be like, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, ""Oh, well, maybe I can take one more."" And that's when I start, you know, falling into-",client
68,153,['O'],Okay.,therapist
68,154,['C'],-way too much.,client
68,155,['SR'],"So, uh, uh, a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you would like-",therapist
68,156,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,157,['SR'],-would like to make some adjustments-,therapist
68,158,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
68,159,"['OQ', 'SR']","-to-to make it a little smoother. Okay. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself?",therapist
68,160,['C'],"Um, I'd like to make sure that I'd, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body, I'd like to, you know, try to drink less.",client
68,161,['O'],Okay.,therapist
68,162,['C'],"Like I-I-- You know, it is nice to let loose and have fun, but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body, you know.",client
68,163,['O'],Right.,therapist
68,164,['C'],Like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22.,client
68,165,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
68,166,['C'],"And, um, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group, as a- as a community.",client
68,167,['SR'],Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-,therapist
68,168,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,169,"['CQ', 'SR']","-goals. Okay. So, you-you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right now?",therapist
68,170,['N'],I'd say about like-like a six or a seven.,client
68,171,['O'],"Oh, okay.",therapist
68,172,['N'],"I'd like to work on it but, you know, if I get around to it, I get around to it. If I don't, I don't.",client
68,173,['OQ'],Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?,therapist
68,174,['C'],"Um, because I still think it's-it's important.",client
68,175,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
68,176,['C'],"I still, you know. Like I said, I don't want to hurt my body. Especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your-your social and your school work and things like. I know that once I get to college, it's not- it's not gonna-gonna work out being, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam. Like I know that's not- that's not feasible. It's not a good idea.",client
68,177,['SR'],"Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.",therapist
68,178,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,179,['OQ'],"Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-",therapist
68,180,['N'],I think I-,client
68,181,['CQ'],-on that same scale from one to ten?,therapist
68,182,['N'],"I think if I made the decision that I was going to, for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know it'd be going through.",client
68,183,['OQ'],"Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?",therapist
68,184,['C'],"It's just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. It's making the decision in the first place.",client
68,185,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?",therapist
68,186,['C'],"Um, I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding, you know, dorky or something and be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, hey, I'm not like-- I'm not going to drink today. And then even if my friends do, like being okay with them, drinking around me and not doing it, and then them being okay with me drinking-- Me not drinking and them doing whatever they want.",client
68,187,['SR'],"So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-",therapist
68,188,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,189,['SR'],-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking.,therapist
68,190,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,191,['CQ'],Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?,therapist
68,192,['C'],I think so. I think it's-it's very feasible. I think it's possible.,client
68,193,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Okay. Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to sort of see how it's going?",therapist
68,194,['C'],I think so. I think that's good.,client
68,195,['CQ'],Does that sound like something you'd like to do?,therapist
68,196,['N'],Yeah.,client
68,197,['SR'],"Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there.",therapist
68,198,['SR'],"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much.",therapist
68,199,['SR'],"Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and-and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going.",therapist
68,200,['C'],"Yeah, I'd like to.",client
68,201,['O'],All right. Great. So I'll-I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.,therapist
68,202,['N'],Perfect. Nice.,client
68,203,['O'],Great.,therapist
70,0,"['CQ', 'SR']","Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?",therapist
70,1,['N'],"Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though.",client
70,2,['CQ'],"All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?",therapist
70,3,['N'],"Um, nothing specific. I just am unfamiliar with the medication.",client
70,4,['GI'],"Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks.",therapist
70,5,['N'],"Okay. Uh, what about side effects?",client
70,6,"['CQ', 'GI']","If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?",therapist
70,7,['N'],"Um, what about does it interact with phenelzine?",client
70,8,"['CQ', 'GI']","Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?",therapist
70,9,['N'],"Oh, sure.",client

71,5,['N'],"Yeah, it'd be good.",client
71,6,['OQ'],"Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.",therapist
71,7,['C'],I guess it doesn't.,client
71,8,['OQ'],"Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?",therapist
71,9,['C'],"Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.",client
71,10,['CQ'],Yeah?,therapist
71,11,['C'],Yeah. It kinda messes things up.,client
71,12,['CQ'],"Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?",therapist
71,13,['C'],Yeah. It makes it harder.,client
71,14,['CQ'],"Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?",therapist
71,15,['N'],Mm.,client
71,16,['CR'],And harder to—,therapist
71,17,['C'],"Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.",client
71,18,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
71,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,20,['CR'],And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.,therapist
71,21,['N'],Mm.,client
71,22,['OQ'],"Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?",therapist
71,23,['C'],"Uh, I don't know if-if I would go into polytech, done courses there or something.",client
71,24,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist

71,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,28,['CR'],You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-,therapist
71,29,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
71,30,['CQ'],-getting a qualification?,therapist
71,31,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,32,['OQ'],"Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?",therapist
71,33,['N'],"Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.",client
71,34,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?",therapist
71,35,['C'],"[sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's cars.",client
71,36,['SR'],"Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?",therapist
71,37,['N'],"Yes, pretty much.",client
71,38,['CQ'],Yeah?,therapist
71,39,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,40,['OQ'],Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?,therapist
71,41,['C'],"Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.",client
71,42,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
71,43,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,44,['OQ'],"Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?",therapist
71,45,['N'],"Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but—",client
71,46,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
71,47,['N'],"It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.",client
71,48,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
71,49,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,50,['OQ'],"Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?",therapist
71,51,['C'],"Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.",client
71,52,['OQ'],"Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?",therapist
71,53,['N'],"Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it.",client
71,54,['SR'],"Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—",therapist
71,55,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
71,56,['CQ'],-and picked up some forms?,therapist
71,57,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything.",client

71,63,['N'],-I got some forms and-,client
71,64,['OQ'],Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?,therapist
71,65,['N'],"I asked- I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-",client
71,66,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
71,67,['N'],"-well, the forms, it's too confusing.",client
71,68,['O'],"Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?",therapist
71,69,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-",client
71,70,['O'],Mm.,therapist
71,71,['N'],"-so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.",client
71,72,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
71,73,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,74,['CQ'],"Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?",therapist
71,75,['N'],"Yeah. I was gonna fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was gonna get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it.",client
71,76,['CQ'],Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?,therapist
71,77,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,78,['OQ'],Yeah? What-what's the confusing bit?,therapist
71,79,['N'],"I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.",client
71,80,['OQ'],"Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?",therapist
71,81,['N'],I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like writing.,client
71,82,['CQ'],You don't like writing?,therapist
71,83,['N'],No.,client
71,84,['OQ'],"Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.",therapist
71,85,['N'],"No, I'm just real messy, so people can't read it.",client
71,86,['CQ'],People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?,therapist
71,87,['N'],"[chuckles] Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah.",client
71,88,['O'],"Oh, you must be a doctor.",therapist
71,89,['N'],"Yeah, I am. [chuckles]",client
71,90,['O'],Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?,therapist
71,91,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,92,['CQ'],"Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?",therapist
71,93,['N'],"Yeah. Like, a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that.",client
71,94,['O'],Mm.,therapist
71,95,['N'],"But, we don't have a computer.",client
71,96,['OQ'],"Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?",therapist
71,97,['N'],"Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing.",client
71,98,['SR'],"Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-",therapist
71,99,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,100,['CQ'],-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?,therapist
71,101,['N'],"Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just-",client
71,102,['O'],Okay.,therapist
71,103,['N'],"-I'm sure most people can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it.",client
71,104,['OQ'],"Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?",therapist
71,105,['N'],No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?,client
71,106,['CQ'],"Well, have you got the forms with you?",therapist
71,107,['N'],No.,client
71,108,['CR'],"Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-",therapist
71,109,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,110,['CR'],"-and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-",therapist
71,111,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,112,['O'],"-which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms.",therapist
71,113,['N'],Mm.,client
71,114,['OQ'],"Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?",therapist
71,115,['N'],"I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to.",client
71,116,['CR'],"She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed.",therapist
71,117,['S'],"Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in.",client
71,118,['O'],Mm.,therapist
71,119,['N'],At night.,client
71,120,['SR'],"So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-",therapist
71,121,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,122,['CR'],"-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that.",therapist
71,123,['S'],"Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good.",client
71,124,['CR'],"Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way.",therapist
71,125,['N'],"Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it.",client
71,126,['O'],Mm. Okay.,therapist
71,127,['S'],It's a waste of time.,client
71,128,['GI'],"All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conversation around that.",therapist
71,129,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,130,['OQ'],"So, what's really getting in the way?",therapist
71,131,['N'],For what?,client
71,132,['OQ'],"Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?",therapist
71,133,['N'],"Of what? Well, I don't get it.",client
71,134,['CR'],"Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-",therapist
71,135,['N'],Yeah. I can't.,client
71,136,['OQ'],-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?,therapist
71,137,['N'],"Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write and read.",client
71,138,['O'],Mm.,therapist
71,139,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,140,['O'],"Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded.",therapist
71,141,['N'],Like--,client
71,142,['O'],[chuckles],therapist
71,143,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,144,['O'],"Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here.",therapist
71,145,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,146,['SR'],"So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you.",therapist
71,147,['N'],"No, not really. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it.",client
71,148,['O'],Mm.,therapist
71,149,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,150,['OQ'],"So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?",therapist
71,151,['N'],"I don't know. Hopefully, not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess.",client
71,152,['O'],"So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?",therapist
71,153,['C'],It'd make everything easier.,client
71,154,['O'],Mm.,therapist
71,155,['N'],"Like-- I don't really like reading books or anything, so I don't really care about that but just, say, real-life stuff like going to the bank, and stuff like that-",client
71,156,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
71,157,['N'],"-yeah, that have filling out forms.",client
71,158,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
71,159,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,160,['O'],"And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-",therapist
71,161,['N'],Yeah.,client
71,162,['SR'],"-your course that, you know, to-- the hands-on stuff, it sounds like you're really confident around doing, but it's the more reading, writing, book, kind of, stuff that you are not so--",therapist
71,163,['N'],"Yeah, I didn't think about that.",client
71,164,['O'],Mm.,therapist
71,165,['N'],"Yeah, that'd suck if you had to read, like, a big manual or something. Hmm.",client
71,166,['CR'],Mm. Okay. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and there's some things that need to happen before that.,therapist
71,167,['N'],Mm.,client
71,168,['GI'],"Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what's the very first step.",therapist
73,0,['N'],"He, um, introduced me to it too, so I've tried it.",client
73,1,['SR'],"So with his encouragement, you-you tried some drugs.",therapist
73,2,['N'],Oxy.,client
73,3,['SR'],You tried oxy? Okay.,therapist
73,4,['N'],Yeah.,client
73,5,['SR'],Okay. And he encouraged you to do that.,therapist
73,6,['N'],"Well, yeah he said it was a pain- a pain medicine.",client
73,7,['SR'],He said that it would help you with some of the pain that you've been having.,therapist
73,8,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
73,9,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
73,10,['N'],"And it has, but I don't do it as often, it's just sometimes.",client
73,11,"['CR', 'OQ']","Okay. So you trusted him on that, and you tried it out and you found that it helped you in certain ways. What are some of the things that you said it's-- takes some of the pain away, it's not just-- you know.",therapist
73,12,['S'],Dealing with my grandma's loss.,client
73,13,['SR'],"Okay, so that's helped you.",therapist
73,14,['S'],"Yeah. I feel alone, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it does help but,-",client
73,15,['SR'],Mm-hmm. So it help—,therapist
73,16,['C'],-I don't wanna have to rely on having to take that.,client
73,17,['CR'],"Okay. So it's not something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you'v found at least for the moment very helpful?",therapist
73,18,['N'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, and—",client
73,19,['CR'],"But it's not something that you wanna make a habit of becoming reliant on, or dependent?",therapist
73,20,['C'],Right.,client
73,21,['CR'],"Yeah, okay. Um, and-and so that's a lot going on right now for you? Yeah.",therapist
73,22,['N'],"Yeah, it is.",client
73,23,['CR'],"You've been managing in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about it too, it sounds like?",therapist
73,24,['S'],"Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.",client
73,25,['SR'],"Okay, so for now you know that it makes you feel good.",therapist
76,0,['N'],Hi.,client
76,1,['OQ'],"Hi, Deborah. How are you doing today?",therapist
76,2,['N'],"Good, I'm doing really good.",client
76,3,['CQ'],"Yes, um, so you did do your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about that you discovered?",therapist
76,4,['N'],"Yeah, I really like doing this, and, um, I-I rated health as my first-",client
76,5,['CQ'],"Oh, so it's your first?",therapist
76,6,['N'],"-uh, value. Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole package, I guess, health. Um, and I'm working on, um, a certification to become a fitness trainer. Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40] there's a like extension program. I've been doing that for the last five weeks. I have a final exam coming up, like, Saturday. A little tense about it, I guess, but, um, I'm looking forward to, like, doing it, and I gotta wait for my results. Then, I got into an internship.",client
76,7,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,8,['N'],"Um, but it's kind of exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long is getting boring too-- physical activity, health, in that respect.",client
76,9,"['CQ', 'SR']","So, health being your number one, um, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior officer worker? You're doing something that you're actually living to do.",therapist
76,10,['N'],"Yeah, I like being active. You know, if I could, um, be more adept to tennis, and I would love to do something like that coaching people how to play tennis, but I don't. I know enough about the game and play it, but I-I don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people but—",client
76,11,['CQ'],"Now, have you done this sheet more than once?",therapist
76,12,['N'],"Yes, I have.",client
76,13,['CQ'],"And then, has health always been number one for you?",therapist
76,14,['N'],"It's been in the top. It's been up there, yeah. I don't remember if it's always been number one. It's probably definitely been in the top three. Uh, yeah, because I've had problems, um, with inner harmony, I guess in different stages in my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it at number two.",client
76,15,['CQ'],Inner harmony is number two?,therapist
76,16,['N'],"Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12. But then when I look at it again it had something to do with, um, peace, uh, inner peace or something or something in there.",client
76,17,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,18,['N'],"And, um, I put that as a higher priority, or top of my value list.",client
76,19,['CQ'],"So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?",therapist
76,20,['C'],"Yeah. Um, since I've been practicing yoga, and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that I've been, um, coming to terms with more, that I feel like I have a lot more inner harmony. I'm more at peace with myself, and in-in the quiet times, and if I'm meditating.",client
76,21,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,22,['N'],"Um, I really feel like-- yeah, I feel like really good about myself.",client
76,23,['CQ'],"So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony? That's where that comes from?",therapist
76,24,['N'],"Yeah, that's part of it. Yeah, and then just feeling like, um, I don't have to please other people either. It's not a selfish thing to put myself first. And, uh, that's something I've always tried to do, make other people happy, please other people, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. And I always thought, ""Well, that's the way a good person should be.They should always put other people first, you know. And then there's times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, ""Well, my needs aren't so important right now."" I think that is okay to do once in a while. As long as you know- you know that you're not really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. And you realize, ""Well, I'm just-- I'm really helping this other person a lot, and it gives me satisfaction.""",client
76,25,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,26,['N'],"Not out of a sense of, uh, you know, ""I'm obligated to this person.""",client
76,27,['SR'],"Yes, yes, yes. So, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, and fourth. Um, it was- it was really a problem, you know, like, how could you be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself when-",therapist
76,28,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
76,29,['CR'],"-the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self-self worth, and you know, self-- and-and dealing with-",therapist
76,30,['N'],Self love.,client
76,31,['SR'],-self love.,therapist
76,32,['N'],"Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. [crosstalk] And that it's not selfish.",client
76,33,['O'],"Yeah that's not selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, um, just as long as it's not detrimental to yourself. It's true.",therapist
76,34,['N'],"Yes. Yeah. Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other people. Being there for other people, you know, and-and if it puts myself out. Like I have my brother, his-his daughter, and his granddaughter they come over and, uh, I slept on-on the air mattress and, uh, me with my mother and my dad and my sis-- my-- his daughter in the other spare room that I have.",client
76,35,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,36,['N'],"And I do that, but I think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that I have a guest. I could sleep in my bed all the other days. [unintelligible 00:05:54]",client
76,37,['N'],"So, you know, even if it's a little inconvenient for me, or my house gets messy, or my kitchen is a mess, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves it's okay. You know, I'll live. You know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. Yeah. Before it was wisdom, because I really, that's, um-- it is high on my list and it might be higher if these other things weren't here.",client
76,38,['N'],"But I like I enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the world and then just also being around people that live in the community that are from other cultures. And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. And just also being open to, uh, differences. And then like today, Election Day realizing that something might happen, uh, in the Congress or the Senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but if it happens, it happens, and I have to deal with it and-and be at peace with myself with about whatever anybody else is doing I still have to have that inner peace within myself.",client
76,39,['SR'],"And in the sense of you saying in your words, you'll live.",therapist
76,40,['N'],Right. Mm-hmm.,client
76,41,['SR'],"So, live, um, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you know that you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge [unintelligible 00:07:30] values.",therapist
76,42,['N'],Yeah.,client
76,43,['SR'],And learning the differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom.,therapist
76,44,['N'],"Yes. And school learning in the classroom and outside of the classroom. Where I've been in different Native American communities, reservations, place I spent two months in the summertime really, uh, learning about the cultures is a beautiful place to be, there's a lot of wisdom. And, uh, fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction-",client
76,45,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,46,['N'],"-enjoyment. I think it's intertwined in a lot of things. It's fun to learn about pe-- other people, other cultures. it's fun to have the inner harmony. I think that- I think that was an all-encompassing thing about life. The part of it is to experience pleasure. Yeah.",client
76,47,['SR'],So pleasure being your number five.,therapist
76,48,['N'],Yeah.,client
76,49,['O'],Okay.,therapist
76,50,['N'],"And when I think of the flip side of that, uh, um, I-I know there's gonna be pain, disappointment, upset in my life, um, too that I accept that and that's part of joy.",client
76,51,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,52,['N'],True joy comes from knowing it's not always gonna be happy. I'm gonna- I'm gonna be bummed out sometimes.,client
76,53,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
76,54,['N'],"I'm gonna be disappointed, I'm gonna be injured or whatever.",client
76,55,['SR'],So you've taken that into account that-,therapist
76,56,['N'],Absolutely.,client
76,57,['SR'],-things may happen in life.,therapist
76,58,['N'],Mm-hmm. Yeah.,client
76,59,['SR'],It sounds as though your list is like definitely a story. I-It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three. Uh—,therapist
76,60,['N'],Inner harmony.,client
76,61,['SR'],"Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow yourself to help other people or to serve-service.",therapist
76,62,['N'],Right.,client
76,63,['SR'],"Not being, you know, whatever you did for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't be able to find, um, problems with helping other people. And, uh, that's when service which is your number three or number four, which has been wisdom. You learning different, you know, cultures and having that broad range of-of just opening your eyes and seeing the world in a whole another scope.And then five which being pleasure, which is also okay, I do see the whole world and I know that within myself that I'm able to, you know, accept that I will have things coming out of me as far as, you know, not being, you know, uh, it's like, okay, things might happen. You're gonna get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21]",therapist
76,64,['N'],Yeah.,client
76,65,['O'],"Well, it was nice talking to you.",therapist
76,66,['N'],"Yeah, it was nice being here and having you listen to me. Encouraging me was okay.",client
76,67,['O'],Okay.,therapist
77,0,['OQ'],"Hi, Mrs. Smith. It's really nice to see you again. I see you're back to follow up on the stroke you had. How are things going for you at the rehab facility?",therapist
77,1,['N'],[signs] Kind of slow.,client
77,2,['CQ'],Kind of slow?,therapist
77,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
77,4,['OQ'],What kind of things have you been in your rehab?,therapist
77,5,['N'],"Oh, they have me doing all kinds of things in different machines and stuff. Yeah, it hurts.",client
77,6,['CQ'],"It hurts? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you having pain?",therapist
77,7,['N'],"Well, just about every joint like especially my knees. They're really-- They have me doing some leg things that-that-that is it really necessary?",client
77,8,['GI'],"Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal.",therapist
77,9,['N'],Okay.,client
77,10,['OQ'],But what are your goals for the long term?,therapist
77,11,['N'],I wanna go home.,client
77,12,['OQ'],"Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?",therapist
77,13,['N'],"Everything. I wanna- I wanna, play with my dog. I miss my dog. I wanna cook for myself. I'm a very independent person and I wanna do things for myself.",client
77,14,['CQ'],"Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?",therapist
77,15,['N'],"Um, I guess the rehab.",client
77,16,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like?",therapist
77,17,['N'],Not really.,client
77,18,['CQ'],"Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you?",therapist
77,19,['N'],"Oh, yeah.",client
77,20,['CQ'],You've heard of it?,therapist
77,21,['N'],"Uh, I have.",client
77,22,['O'],Okay.,therapist
77,23,['N'],"I have a friend who, uh, does it and she just raves about it. She loves it.",client
77,24,['GI'],"Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road.",therapist
77,25,['C'],"Absolutely. I do not want to fall, for sure.",client
77,26,['CQ'],So what do you think about Tai Chi? Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime?,therapist
77,27,['N'],"Well, I-I hadn't really thought about it, but yeah I guess, I guess.",client
77,28,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
77,29,['N'],"Like I said, my friend talks about it and-and it's very pretty. I've seen pictures, you know.",client
77,30,['GI'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that easy to get started. You do certainly have to have some motivation to want to do it. Um, and when you first start, oftentimes you do feel a little wobbly or a little insecure.",therapist
77,31,['S'],"Well, I don't see how I could do it. I-I'm still in a walker, you know.",client
77,32,['ADVI'],"Yeah, yeah, I understand. So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair.",therapist
77,33,['N'],I could?,client
77,34,['ADVI'],"You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own.",therapist
77,35,['N'],And you really recommend this?,client
77,36,['GI'],"You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that.",therapist
77,37,['N'],You do Tai Chi?,client
77,38,['GI'],I do Tai Chi. I do it three days a week and it's really helped my balance as well.,therapist
77,39,['C'],"Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Um, listen, anything that's going to get me home and if you do it and you recommend it, I'll try it.",client
77,40,['O'],"All right. Well, I'm delighted. It's a pleasure to see you again. I hope your rehab continues to go well and we can talk some more about this at our next visit.",therapist
77,41,['N'],"Okay, okay.",client
77,42,['O'],All right. Thank you for coming in.,therapist
78,0,['CQ'],Hi. Are you Julie Thompson?,therapist
78,1,['N'],Mm-hmm. Yeah.,client
78,2,['GI'],"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and, uh, I noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-",therapist
78,3,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
78,4,"['GI', 'OQ']",-for her asthma. I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?,therapist
78,5,['C'],"It's been- it's been really difficult. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when I have to take her.",client
78,6,['CR'],"Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening.",therapist
78,7,['C'],Mm-hmm. Yeah.,client
78,8,['GI'],"Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.",therapist
78,9,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
78,10,['O'],Are you having some difficulties with that?,therapist
78,11,['S'],"Well, I did research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steroids in it and that-that I don't want her taking steroids. I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steroids and I-I just don't want her to take those at all. I don't want her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. Uh, because I'm sure it'll come up, but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I do not smoke around her so that I make sure that it does not affect her. So-",client
78,12,['O'],Okay.,therapist
78,13,['N'],-I just want to let you know that right off.,client
78,14,['CR'],"Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.",therapist
78,15,['N'],Mm-hmm. Yeah.,client
78,16,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?",therapist
78,17,['N'],Yeah.,client
78,18,['GI'],"Okay. Even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steroids.",therapist
78,19,['N'],Okay.,client
78,20,['GI'],Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.,therapist
78,21,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
78,22,"['GI', 'OQ']","If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?",therapist
78,23,['N'],"Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids.",client
78,24,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
78,25,['C'],"Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-",client
78,26,"['CR', 'GI']","Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh.""",therapist
78,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
78,28,"['GI', 'SR']","You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.",therapist
78,29,['N'],Okay.,client
78,30,['CQ'],Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?,therapist
78,31,['N'],Yeah.,client
78,32,['GI'],"Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us.",therapist
78,33,['N'],"Oh, okay.",client
78,34,['GI'],And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.,therapist
78,35,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
78,36,['ADVI'],"The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.",therapist
78,37,['N'],Yeah.,client
78,38,['ADVI'],"Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up.",therapist
78,39,['N'],"Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?",client
78,40,['GI'],Yeah. Yeah.,therapist
78,41,['N'],She's that sensitive. If I realized that—,client
78,42,['ADVI'],"It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.",therapist
78,43,['S'],"Right. Um, so would it help, um-- You know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect.",client
78,44,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
78,45,['S'],"I mean, I know people who've tried to quit and it's-it's just it's- it's really difficult, you know. So I know, it'd be better—",client
78,46,"['GI', 'SR']","Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-",therapist
78,47,['N'],Yeah.,client
78,48,['GI'],And-and it's hard to replace it with something.,therapist
78,49,['S'],"Yeah, it is. Um.",client
78,50,['OQ'],"So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?",therapist
78,51,['C'],"Well, I was thinking, um, if since it, you know, it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school, and then changed my clothes before she came home. Would that help?",client
78,52,['GI'],"Oh, that-that sounds like it would be great if you were able to do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the house, you know- you know.",therapist
78,53,['C'],"Oh, absolutely. I never. Never.",client
78,54,['GI'],"Um, so yeah. If you're willing to do that, that certainly would help.",therapist
78,55,['N'],Okay.,client
78,56,['GI'],"Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do.",therapist
78,57,['N'],Yeah. [chuckles],client
78,58,['O'],Okay.,therapist
78,59,['S'],It's really difficult.,client
78,60,['CR'],"So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-",therapist
78,61,['C'],Mm-hmm.,client
78,62,['GI'],"-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency room, and you probably won't need to use the rescue inhaler hardly at all.",therapist
78,63,['N'],"Oh, really?",client
78,64,['GI'],"Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.",therapist
78,65,['C'],"Oh, that's great-",client
78,66,['O'],Okay.,therapist
78,67,['C'],-because that's always scary when she has to use that one.,client
78,68,['GI'],Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.,therapist
78,69,['N'],Okay.,client
78,70,['ADVI'],"Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works.",therapist
78,71,['C'],Okay.,client
78,72,['CQ'],Okay?,therapist
78,73,['C'],That sounds good. Thank you.,client
78,74,['O'],All right. Good.,therapist
79,0,['N'],"Something clicked, I'd had a bunch to drink and, uh, and I knew I'd messed up. I totally messed up.",client
79,1,['OQ'],How did you know you messed up?,therapist
79,2,['C'],"Because I was- because I was right there, man. I was right there in the same place when I'd come home and I'd pop a couple of those pills, it was the same deal, like and I wanted to stay there. I wanted to stay exactly right there. And I just felt like I'd ruined everything. You know, Erin's using the phone now, and he called me the next day and it was, uh, great, but I kinda felt ashamed of myself, and I don't want to feel that way again.",client
79,3,"['OQ', 'SR']","Was it that something happened, um, where you put something that was really important to you at risk? Is that what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, you felt bad talking to Erin on the phone?",therapist
79,4,['C'],"Because of what-- Yeah, I guess, I think that's what I mean, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean- I mean I could have stayed, I could have got, I could have got absolutely hammered and I could have done it every night for the rest of the week.",client
79,5,['SR'],So you saw yourself putting something that was important to you at risk.,therapist
79,6,['C'],"But I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to stop or because, you know, it was like right there, that's where I wanted to stay, you know? Anyway, I just, uh-- [crosstalk].",client
79,7,['SR'],"Here you are actually, three months on, three long months as you say, um, and things have been going really well, Uh, you even get a bit of—",therapist
79,8,['C'],"They're better, yeah.",client
79,9,['CR'],"Yeah. Well, and then you get the kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids, and that was something that was really what you were working for.",therapist
79,10,['C'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
80,0,['O'],"Jean, it's good to see you again.",therapist
80,1,['N'],"Hello, doctor.",client
80,2,['OQ'],"So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?",therapist
80,3,['C'],"Well, I did what we discussed. I did the journal-",client
80,4,['O'],Okay.,therapist
80,5,['C'],"-for a week, uh, trying to mark down the-the difference in my smoking, being more aware when I had the urge, if I could stop the urge-",client
80,6,['O'],Mm.,therapist
80,7,['C'],"-and I found it was okay. It got a little bit scary on the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge has kept on coming-",client
80,8,['O'],Sure.,therapist
80,9,['N'],-to have a cigarette.,client
80,10,['O'],Sure.,therapist
80,11,['C'],"But during the week, I was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week, and that's just in one week. So-",client
80,12,['SR'],"So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were smoking.",therapist
80,13,['C'],Yeah.,client
80,14,['OQ'],"So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?",therapist
80,15,['C'],Yes.,client
80,16,"['CR', 'OQ']","You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?",therapist
80,17,['N'],It just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend-,client
80,18,['O'],Right.,therapist
80,19,['N'],-and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day-,client
80,20,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
80,21,['N'],"-instead of at work. And I found that, um, it was really hard to stop those urges.",client
80,22,['CR'],"Okay. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-",therapist
80,23,['N'],Yes.,client
80,24,['OQ'],"-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?",therapist
80,25,['C'],"But I marked it in the book. Uh, that's one thing I said to myself, I'll be honest in my marking down.",client
80,26,['SR'],"In marking it down, okay.",therapist
80,27,['C'],"So, I'm gonna have to really be aware of the weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy.",client
80,28,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. So, and you've thought about already, what you might do, such as getting a hobby. Any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this?",therapist
80,29,['C'],If I can just postpone it-,client
80,30,['O'],Okay.,therapist
80,31,['C'],"-and-and say, ""Okay, I'm not gonna have it at home-",client

80,33,['C'],"-I'll have it when I get to work or on the way to work.""",client
80,34,['O'],Right.,therapist
80,35,['N'],'Cause I-I-I-,client
80,36,['O'],Sure.,therapist
80,37,['C'],"And then, uh-uh, what I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house.",client
80,38,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Okay. So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?",therapist
80,39,['C'],I think I'd just like to do what I did this first week. I liked the idea of marking it down.,client
80,40,['NEGO'],"Okay, so you can continue with that.",therapist
80,41,['C'],"I-- And it took me a week and I'm down two cigarettes a day, I-I figure.",client
80,42,['O'],Sure.,therapist
80,43,['C'],"What I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes, in other words, another three a day.",client
80,44,['O'],Okay.,therapist
80,45,['C'],"And, um, 'cause I smoke a large pack and small pack, maybe just two small packs.",client
80,46,"['NEGO', 'SR']",You said five cigarettes this time.,therapist
80,47,['C'],Yes.,client
80,48,['OQ'],And any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen?,therapist
80,49,['C'],I can try each day to count.,client
80,50,['O'],Right.,therapist
80,51,['C'],"And I'm still gonna try that when I get the urge to let it go, fight it, and maybe not go out for a cigarette until the next urge comes.",client
80,52,['O'],Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58],therapist
80,53,['C'],"So, if I [unintelligible 00:02:59] between two of them-",client
80,54,['O'],Sure.,therapist
80,55,['C'],-and also coming back and-and talking to you really helps 'cause I have someone to-,client
80,56,['O'],Sure.,therapist
80,57,['C'],-discuss it with.,client
80,58,['OQ'],"So, given what you're-you're attempting to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this?",therapist
80,59,['C'],"I wouldn't mind coming back in a week again because this is all new and-and a week, I can handle a week.",client
80,60,['O'],Absolutely. Okay.,therapist
80,61,['N'],"Okay, thank you doctor.",client

80,63,['N'],"Yes, thank you.",client
81,0,['CQ'],Did you like how your parents raised you?,therapist
81,1,['OQ'],Tell me about how your parents raised you?,therapist
81,2,['OQ'],Tell me about how you've been feeling?,therapist
81,3,['N'],Okay. I guess I've been getting bigger.,client
81,4,['OQ'],"Mm, what's that like for you?",therapist
81,5,['S'],"Uh, scary I guess.",client
81,6,['CR'],So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?,therapist
81,7,['N'],"Yeah. I-I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him.",client
81,8,['O'],Mm.,therapist
81,9,['S'],"I know you want me to see the doctor, I haven't called yet.",client
81,10,['OQ'],Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?,therapist
81,11,['S'],I don't know. It seems overwhelming to me.,client
81,12,['OQ'],What about it seems overwhelming?,therapist
81,13,['S'],"Well, I hate making phone calls and I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there and I hate needles.",client
81,14,['CR'],"Mm. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you just don't like medical appointments and medical people?",therapist
81,15,['N'],Yes.,client
81,16,['OQ'],How can I help you with these things?,therapist
81,17,['C'],Can you help me make the call?,client
81,18,['O'],"Sure, we can do that together.",therapist
81,19,['C'],Can you go with me to the appointment.,client
81,20,['OPTI'],"I can try. I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about ideas on who can go with you to support you so you feel better about attending.",therapist
82,0,['CQ'],Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol and the contraception?,therapist
82,1,['N'],Sure.,client
82,2,['CQ'],"Okay. So we're working on a 10 point of scale 1 to 10, 1 being not important, 10 being very important. One being not confident, one being very confident. So on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the-- what risk limits?",therapist
82,3,['N'],I would say an eight.,client
82,4,['CQ'],"You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?",therapist
82,5,['N'],I would say a four.,client
82,6,['SR'],Amount of four.,therapist
82,7,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
82,8,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. And so let's look at those two. You're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but your confidence is down here, uh, a four, but it's not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink below risk levels and you remember what those are?",therapist
82,9,['C'],"Um, I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path. So I'm-I'm confident that I can change that at this point.",client
82,10,"['OQ', 'SR']",Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?,therapist
82,11,['C'],"Um, well, I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And I think when I hang out with them, it's not an issue. So that also helps me.",client
82,12,['SR'],So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?,therapist
82,13,['N'],Yep.,client
82,14,['CQ'],Okay. Anything else?,therapist
82,15,['N'],Nope.,client
82,16,['CQ'],"Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?",therapist
82,17,['N'],I would say an eight.,client
82,18,"['CQ', 'SR']","An eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?",therapist
82,19,['N'],"Every time,-",client

82,21,['N'],-probably a six.,client
82,22,['GI'],Correctly as it's prescribed.,therapist
82,23,['N'],Probably a six.,client
82,24,"['CR', 'OQ']",Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?,therapist
82,25,['C'],"Um, I'm a six because I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm-- I drank too much and I don't really care too much.",client
82,26,['CR'],"Okay. So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can-- if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of the-",therapist
82,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
82,28,['SR'],-birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here.,therapist
82,29,['N'],Yes.,client
82,30,"['CQ', 'GI', 'SR']","Very good. So it looks like, um, you're using a good method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use at this-- today?",therapist
82,31,['N'],Before I leave?,client

83,8,['CQ'],Right down the bottom? Down Bluff?,therapist
83,9,['N'],Yes sir. I'm from Invercargill just short of Bluff. All my family is still down there.,client
83,10,['CQ'],"Oh, are they? So you were born down there and-",therapist
83,11,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
83,12,['CQ'],-raised down there?,therapist
83,13,['N'],Mm-hmm. Country boy.,client
83,14,['CQ'],Country boy. Been up in Christchurch how long?,therapist
83,15,['N'],I've been up here since I was 18.,client
83,16,['CQ'],"Oh, so you've been here a while?",therapist
83,17,['N'],Just a little while. Yeah.,client
83,18,['CQ'],Oh good. You got family out here?,therapist
83,19,['N'],"Uh, just my own.",client
83,20,"['GI', 'OQ']","Just your own whānau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. Well, Rick, I'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and I are gonna been doing some work together for a while. I'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today.",therapist
83,21,['N'],"Um, I was thinking about what you might ask me, what I would say. I'm thinking about my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work.",client
83,22,['O'],Right.,therapist
83,23,['N'],It's a bit of a bitch.,client
83,24,['GI'],"Okay. I see you've had a bit of experience with, uh, coming to prevention services.",therapist
83,25,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
83,26,['OQ'],What's that been like for you in the past?,therapist
83,27,['N'],"Uh, it's been okay. Um, it hasn't been bad.",client
83,28,['O'],Right.,therapist
83,29,['N'],"I don't know. Kind of nothing, really.",client
83,30,['CQ'],Okay. Similar sort of offending in the past that's brought you back again this time?,therapist
83,31,['N'],Yeah.,client
83,32,"['GI', 'OQ']","One of the, um, things that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?",therapist
83,33,['C'],"Um, I hope that it says that I want to, um, make some changes.",client
83,34,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
83,35,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
83,36,['CQ'],So is that different from when you've come in here before?,therapist
83,37,['N'],Yeah. And I still had to walk through those doors so-,client
83,38,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
83,39,['C'],"-but, um, I just think about my kids, you know.",client
83,40,['CR'],Yeah. So they're really important to you?,therapist
83,41,['N'],Yeah.,client
83,42,['CQ'],Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full-time or-,therapist
83,43,['N'],"No. No, I don't. I see them, um, once a fortnight.",client
83,44,['OQ'],Okay. And what's it like for you?,therapist
83,45,['N'],It sucks.,client
83,46,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
83,47,['N'],Yeah.,client
83,48,['OQ'],"What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your children?",therapist
83,49,['N'],"I just-- I'd love to be able to see them whenever I can, whenever I wanted to.",client
83,50,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
83,51,['C'],"You know. I, um, they're my whole world and-and I've fucked things up.",client
83,52,['O'],Right.,therapist
83,53,['N'],"So, you know.",client
83,54,['OQ'],"So coming along to see me and you and I are doing some work together, then you're going on to do a program, how important is that gonna be for you and your children?",therapist
83,55,['C'],It's really important.,client
83,56,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm. If I was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?",therapist
83,57,['S'],"It's, uh, um, it's hard because-because I'm, uh, I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid shit, but I'm not a bad person.",client
83,58,['O'],Right.,therapist
83,59,['C'],"In-in regards to my kids, I'd be100- 100%.",client
83,60,['O'],Right.,therapist
83,61,['C'],"If it means say, I can have my-- see my kids whenever I- whenever I want.",client
83,62,['OQ'],"Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?",therapist
83,63,['C'],"Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me.",client
83,64,['O'],Okay.,therapist
83,65,['N'],'Cause I'm-- Yeah.,client
83,66,['CQ'],Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?,therapist
83,67,['N'],"Um, oh, my mom.",client
83,68,['CQ'],Yeah. Your is mum still down south?,therapist
83,69,['N'],Yeah.,client
83,70,['CQ'],Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?,therapist
83,71,['N'],No.,client
83,72,"['CR', 'OQ']",So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really serious this time making some changes.,therapist
83,73,['C'],"Yeah, I am.",client
83,74,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
83,75,['S'],"I just, um, I don't- don't know where to s-- where to start. I don't know.",client
83,76,['CQ'],So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?,therapist
83,77,['C'],"Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. I don't deliberately fuck things up for myself.",client
83,78,"['CQ', 'GI']","Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?",therapist
83,79,['C'],"No, this is important to me.",client
83,80,['O'],Right.,therapist
83,81,['C'],"I have, um, I've-- it's important to me.",client
83,82,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?",therapist
83,83,['N'],"I, um, I'm separated at the moment from my missus and-",client
83,84,['CQ'],What was-- what was your partner's name?,therapist
83,85,['N'],"Uh, Kirsty.",client
83,86,['SR'],Kristy.,therapist
83,87,['C'],"I would- I would love f-f-for her to know that I'm doing this and for her to know that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't give a shit right now actually.",client
83,88,['CQ'],"Right. In terms of your employer, would they be supportive?",therapist
83,89,['N'],"Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though.",client
83,90,['OQ'],Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?,therapist
83,91,['N'],"Uh, I don't know.",client
83,92,['CQ'],"Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?",therapist
83,93,['N'],I'm pretty much by myself up here.,client
83,94,['GI'],"Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program.",therapist
83,95,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
83,96,"['CQ', 'GI']","The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?",therapist
83,97,['N'],"Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-",client
83,98,['O'],Okay.,therapist
83,99,['N'],"-that I am-- I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I don't know.",client
83,100,"['GI', 'OQ']","Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?",therapist
83,101,['C'],"Yeah, let's give it some thought.",client
83,102,"['CQ', 'CR']","Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?",therapist
83,103,['N'],Yeah. That'll definitely be true.,client
83,104,"['CQ', 'SR']","Your family is down south. I mean,who-who-who else do you think would be really interested in sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?",therapist
83,105,['N'],"Uh, I have a good relationship with my mum,-",client
83,106,['O'],Okay.,therapist
83,107,['N'],-with my brothers and sisters.,client
83,108,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
83,109,['N'],My mum is actually pretty important to me.,client
83,110,['OQ'],"Yeah. How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family? What-what might that be like for her to hear?",therapist
83,111,['C'],I think she'd be proud of me.,client
83,112,['O'],Yeah. All right.,therapist
83,113,['N'],Yeah.,client
83,114,['CQ'],"Brothers and sisters, that, uh, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?",therapist
83,115,['N'],"Yeah. Yeah. A good, uh, good family.",client
83,116,['OQ'],"Good. So how would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board, and be accountable to doing this work together?",therapist
83,117,['C'],"Um, I don't know. Um, have some-somebody just to listen.",client
83,118,['OQ'],"And, um, I’m just trying to imagine what do you think your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?",therapist
83,119,['C'],She would- she would tell me that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes that I could do it.,client
83,120,['OQ'],"Mm. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your children?",therapist
83,121,['C'],For them to have a father they can look up to.,client
83,122,['CR'],I’m getting a strong sense that's what you want as well.,therapist
83,123,['C'],It is what I want. Definitely.,client
83,124,['CQ'],"So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your whānau and ours, where do you think your confidence level might be now?",therapist
83,125,['C'],"If I had their support of my-my family and [silence] I want to say that would be higher. I just know I fucked it up in the past. If they were there to support me now, then I’d be 99% sure.",client
83,126,['CR'],"That's a huge move up the scale, isn't it? So getting your family on board, getting your whānau on board is going to be really important for us.",therapist
83,127,['C'],Yeah.,client
84,0,['OQ'],Hi Billy. How are you doing?,therapist
84,1,['N'],"Yeah, I'm all right.",client
84,2,"['GI', 'OQ']","Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you here and good to see you here on time. Yeah, it's really good to see a good start to the-- to your probation time with us here is to see you being here on time. So how did you get here today?",therapist
84,3,['N'],Just caught the bus.,client
84,4,['CR'],"Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?",therapist
84,5,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,6,"['GI', 'OQ']","Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here?",therapist
84,7,['N'],Just a waste of my time.,client
84,8,['CR'],"Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.""",therapist
84,9,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
84,10,['OQ'],Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on?,therapist
84,11,['N'],Last time didn't really work out that well.,client
84,12,['SR'],"Yeah, didn't- didn't work out very well.",therapist
84,13,['N'],Nothing really helped me.,client
84,14,['CR'],Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time.,therapist
84,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,16,['SR'],Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too.,therapist
84,17,['N'],"Yeah, I'd say so.",client
84,18,['OQ'],"Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?",therapist
84,19,['N'],"She didn't really listen to me, just told me what to do. She just bossed me around.",client
84,20,['CR'],"Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here?",therapist
84,21,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",client
84,22,['SR'],"Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you.",therapist
84,23,['N'],"Yeah, she didn't really care.",client
84,24,['CR'],"Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?",therapist
84,25,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,26,['OQ'],"Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think?",therapist
84,27,['N'],I-I don't care that you're a woman. It's just- it's that you don't know what it's like to be me.,client
84,28,['O'],Okay.,therapist
84,29,['N'],You have a different upbringing and live in a different place of town. Just-,client
84,30,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
84,31,['N'],-you wouldn't understand.,client
84,32,['GI'],"Okay, and all of those things are true.",therapist
84,33,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,34,"['CQ', 'GI', 'SR']",You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?,therapist
84,35,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,36,['CR'],"Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you.",therapist
84,37,['N'],"Yeah, so it is.",client
84,38,['CQ'],"Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all.""",therapist
84,39,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
84,40,['CQ'],"100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale?",therapist
84,41,['S'],"Well, not too high. It's not like I'm out killing people or anything. It's just-",client
84,42,['O'],Okay.,therapist
84,43,['S'],-silly stuff.,client
84,44,['SR'],All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble.,therapist
84,45,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,46,['OQ'],"Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff?",therapist
84,47,['C'],"Mm, lots. When I stop getting caught. Don't wanna be back here again.",client
84,48,['SR'],"Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and-",therapist
84,49,['C'],No.,client
84,50,['CR'],-to talk to a probation officer again.,therapist
84,51,['C'],"No, sorry.",client
84,52,['OQ'],Okay. So where would you be do you think?,therapist
84,53,['N'],"Mm, like what out of a scale it would like fall?",client
84,54,['GI'],"Zero being, ""Argh, not interested at all,"" 100 being totally into it.",therapist
84,55,['N'],"Mmh, 25.",client
84,56,['SR'],"25, okay.",therapist
84,57,['N'],Mmh.,client
84,58,['CR'],So I know that you're kind of 25% interested-,therapist
84,59,['N'],Mmh.,client
84,60,['CR'],-and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble.,therapist
84,61,['C'],"Maybe but, mm, yeah, I wanna stop getting into trouble.",client
84,62,['SR'],You wanna stop getting into trouble.,therapist
84,63,['S'],"Yeah, but I don't think what I'm doing is that bad.",client
84,64,['O'],"Mm, okay.",therapist
84,65,['S'],Just unlucky.,client
84,66,['CR'],"Okay, so getting into trouble and, uh, getting caught and-and we see [unintelligible 00:05:36] does about luck and this time being unlucky.",therapist
84,67,['S'],"Yeah, the cops just have it out for me.",client
84,68,['OQ'],"Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the [unintelligible 00:05:46] the cops have got it on for you?",therapist
84,69,['S'],"Just 'cause growing up dealing with them and my mates and stuff and there's, you know, guilty before charged or whatever.",client
84,70,['CR'],"Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky.",therapist
84,71,['S'],"Yeah, me and my mates always get singled out.",client
84,72,['CR'],"Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation.",therapist
84,73,['S'],Yeah.,client
84,74,['O'],"Yeah. So I'm wondering, um, if there are things that you think, ""Well, I can see that that's got me into trouble,"" and, you know, kind of cops aside, things that might have got you into-into trouble.",therapist
84,75,['N'],"Just jacking cars and just stealing just, like, stuff and smokes and got done for that.",client
84,76,['SR'],"Mm-hmm, okay. So some stuff that you can think, ""Oh yeah, I had, you know, I did some stuff that yeah, got me into trouble.""",therapist
84,77,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,78,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","It wasn't perhaps about the police singling you out. So those little things, well, you think, ""Mm, yeah, maybe-maybe if I'd done something differently, I wouldn't have ended up in trouble."" How interested are you in thinking about those things and-",therapist
84,79,['N'],"Yeah, well, I-",client
84,80,['OQ'],-trying to get a handle on that.,therapist
84,81,['C'],-wanna stop getting in trouble. Don't wanna-,client
84,82,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
84,83,['C'],-end up in prison for the rest of my life for doing stupid little things.,client
84,84,['CR'],"Okay, so you don't wanna end up kind of being in prison again 'cause you've done some time inside. Yeah, and you don't wanna end up going back to prison, yeah. So-so that's one thing about wanting to make a difference and the way things are at the moment, yeah.",therapist
84,85,['C'],Yeah.,client
84,86,['OQ'],"Cool. What else would, um, would help to kind of keep you out of trouble do you think?",therapist
84,87,['C'],"Get some income, some good cash or something.",client
84,88,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
84,89,['N'],A nice job.,client
84,90,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
84,91,['N'],A good-- yeah.,client
84,92,['CQ'],"So the things about that have got you into trouble in the past, um, how confident are you that, um, that you can do something to not keep going down the same path? Zero is like, ""I'm not confident at all that I can make any changes,"" and 100 is like, ""I'm so supremely confident."" Where would you be?",therapist
84,93,['N'],"Pretty confident if I had a good job but otherwise, probably have to keep stealing stuff, I don't know.",client
84,94,['O'],Okay.,therapist
84,95,['N'],So it depends.,client
84,96,['SR'],"All right, so if you were in a good job-",therapist
84,97,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,98,['SR'],"-one with cars, one that-",therapist
84,99,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",client
84,100,['SR'],"-you really liked, you feel that you would be pretty confident to deal with the stuff that gets you into trouble?",therapist
84,101,['C'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause it's just small stuff that, you know, just 'cause I don't have any cash.",client
84,102,['CR'],"Okay, so you don't have any cash and that's the stuff that causes you to do the small stuff-",therapist
84,103,['S'],Yeah.,client
84,104,['CR'],-and get you into trouble.,therapist
84,105,['N'],"Yeah, just stupid little shit, yeah.",client
84,106,['CR'],"Okay, so if you had a job, you feel pretty confident, but if you don't have a job, your confidence is much-is much lower, is that-",therapist
84,107,['S'],Yeah.,client
84,108,['CQ'],-what I'm hearing? Yeah.,therapist
84,109,['N'],"Yeah, no. That's-",client
84,110,['O'],Okay.,therapist
84,111,['N'],"-not an excuse but, yeah, I'll probably keep doing it. Just try not to get caught.",client
84,112,['CR'],"Okay, so if you don't have a job you reckon, um, you'll probably gonna keep on offending.",therapist
84,113,['S'],"Yeah. Yeah, I just get bored and stuff.",client
84,114,['SR'],"Okay, so part of this, what's going on is you also getting bored?",therapist
84,115,['S'],"Yeah, I get bored real easy.",client
84,116,"['GI', 'OQ']","Mmh. Yeah, say something more about that. It sounds really interesting about you knowing that you get bored really easily.",therapist
84,117,['N'],I don't know. I got a short attention span or something.,client
84,118,['OQ'],"Yeah, what-what makes you say that?",therapist
84,119,['N'],"Uh, just can't sit around home all day. I'd wanna go out and do something exciting.",client
84,120,['CR'],"Okay, so you wanna kind of get some action, don't wanna sit around-",therapist
84,121,['N'],Mmh.,client
84,122,['GI'],"-all the time. But one of the things I'm noticing, we've been going here for a wee while now talking and, uh, I haven't noticed any lack of attention.",therapist
84,123,['N'],Just talking about something I like. Like talking about cars is all good.,client
84,124,['CR'],"Okay, so we [unintelligible 00:09:47] something that interests you.",therapist
84,125,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,126,['OQ'],"Mmh, and when we might be talking about something that doesn't interest you, what would I notice?",therapist
84,127,['N'],I probably just wouldn't listen.,client
84,128,['GI'],"Okay. All right, so-so one of the challenges is for us to be talking about things that interest you. Yeah.",therapist
84,129,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,130,['GI'],"Um, and also maybe get to the point where things are different in your life Where you're not getting into trouble and things feel a bit more sorted in your life.",therapist
84,131,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
84,132,['OQ'],"Hi, Billy, how are you doing? It's good to see you again.",therapist

84,171,['N'],Yeah.,client
84,172,['CQ'],Am I picking that up?,therapist
84,173,['S'],"Oh no, just stupid stuff. Just when she like-- she has to go to work and stuff, so I have to keep myself busy.",client

84,228,['OQ'],"What's that about, Billy?",therapist

85,30,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
85,31,['S'],"It doesn't-- I don't like the way it makes you feel, um, I don't like the way it makes me act, and it's taken my sex drive, and just thrown it at the back of the garbage truck.",client
85,32,['CR'],"Well, that is a bummer. I mean—",therapist
85,33,['N'],It is.,client
85,34,"['CQ', 'SR']","So you said the-the first one you said, you don't like the way it makes you feel?",therapist

85,37,['S'],"Well, i-it's kinda like I'm in kind of a dreamy world.

It seems like everything's bland, and nothing really-- Food doesn't taste the same, and things don't smell right, and—",client
85,38,['SR'],Very dull.,therapist
85,39,['S'],Very dull.,client
85,40,['SR'],Very dull.,therapist
85,41,['S'],Very dull.,client
85,42,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
85,43,['S'],"That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.",client
85,44,"['OQ', 'SR']","Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.",therapist
85,45,['S'],"Well, I feel like it's taken part of my personality and just thrown it away. I don't really feel like I'm all there, right. You know, like, um, I like to be spontaneous and funny, and-and all that night, and I- and I don't-- You know, by the time I come up with a-a funny remark to the situation, everybody's left the room, and-[laughter]-stuff like that.

85,46,['CR'],"It's really, your timing is [unintelligible 00:03:13]",therapist
85,47,['N'],Absolutely.,client
85,48,['SR'],So you feel slow.,therapist
85,49,['S'],"And so, as you can can tell, I didn't take my medication today, I'm-I'm-I'm really on my game today. So.",client
85,50,['CR'],"So, it's, you know, thinking as quickly and responding as quickly and-and things like that-- [crosstalk]",therapist
85,51,['N'],More like takes the edge off-,client
85,52,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
85,53,['N'],-for sure.,client
85,54,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
85,55,['N'],"Well, you understand that.",client
85,56,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
85,57,['N'],You-you can- you can understand why I don't take it.,client
85,58,['CR'],"To tell you, it sounds terrible, actually. Yeah. So, that that-that really-- And then- and then, to top it all off, literally, I mean, no sex drive.",therapist
85,59,['N'],Right-right.,client
85,60,['OQ'],"And-and your wife, what does she have to say about that?",therapist
85,61,['S'],"Well, she wants to know who I am and what did I do with her husband.",client
85,62,['CR'],"Yeah. Where's Scott? Where did- where did Scott go? That feisty, spirited guy, where- where'd he go?",therapist
85,63,['N'],Yeah.,client
85,64,['SR'],With the libido out the door.,therapist
85,65,['N'],"Yeah. And, uh- and so, she-- Actually, she-- When I first went on the medicine, she thought I was maybe messing around with somebody else, 'cause, I-I just wasn't interested in it at all.",client
85,66,['O'],"Oh, okay.",therapist
85,67,['N'],I canceled my subscription to the spice channel.,client
85,68,['O'],I didn't even know they had a spice channel. [chuckles],therapist
85,69,['N'],I don't know if they still have it or not. [chuckles],client
85,70,['OQ'],"So they-- So, um, before you started taking the medication, though, when she was, you know, um-- Even though now she's like, ""Where is my old Scott,"" and stuff, well, were there any times when she wanted you to go on the medication? And, if so, what-what prompted those?",therapist
85,71,['C'],"Well, if I stay off the medication too long, I-- Some people might say there's a problem with that, you know.",client
85,72,['CR'],You were right.,therapist
85,73,['C'],"Well, I guess running around the neighborhood with no clothes on isn't really good.",client
85,74,['O'],Okay.,therapist
85,75,['N'],"Um, I thought I had a, uh—",client
85,76,['CR'],Might get you into trouble [unintelligible 00:05:06],therapist
85,77,['N'],"Yeah, well, I thought I had my gym shorts on, but they said that I didn't.",client
85,78,['OQ'],Okay. What else?,therapist
85,79,['N'],"Well, I-I ended up in the hospital.",client
85,80,['OQ'],What do you think about the hospital?,therapist
85,81,['C'],Don't like that hospital.,client
85,82,['O'],No.,therapist
85,83,['N'],"Uh. [clears throat] I'm not sure that the hospital is worse than the cotton ball, but I don't like it either.",client
85,84,"['CQ', 'CR']","So, you'd really like to stay out of that hospital?",therapist
85,85,['S'],"Well, I got a question for you. You're a doctor, why don't you guys come up with some- something else besides either being in the hospital or taking this stuff every day, can you come up with something? I mean, you guys, we put a man on the moon 50 years ago, I mean, and you still got to give me this stuff that makes me feel like a-a zombie with-- That hasn't had a drink or water in four days, it-it just doesn't seem right. Either you guys ought to come up with something better. That's what I think.",client
85,86,['O'],"I agree with you, I really do. So-- And I- and I think that a lot of times, um, the medications, they do have a lot of side effects, and I completely understand why people don't wanna take them-",therapist
85,87,['N'],Yeah.,client
85,88,"['CQ', 'CR']","Yet, at the same time, I know running around and getting in trouble for being naked or having to go to the hospital, not such a good thing either. Um, I'm wondering if, um- if I could run some ideas by you that some other patients of mine have tried?",therapist
85,89,['N'],I suppose.,client
85,90,['OPTI'],"Okay, thanks. Um, we could if you're-- 'Cause, as you can tell, this is really more of an art than a science, um, try some other medications and see how you do on them, and perhaps, you won't have these side effects. And, um, it-it really is just a matter of kind of experimenting around to get, uh, to see if we can get to a point that at least you're not having these really bad things happen of getting into the hospital and getting arrested and stuff versus feeling more like that-that spirited Scott that, you know, watches Spice channel, you know, I mean-- Because I can tell the spirit of Scott is, uh, a hoot.",therapist
85,91,['C'],"Well. Yeah. Well, yeah, I-I'd like to. I don't know, is it-- Can you- can you drink with them, some of these other ones?",client
85,92,"['GI', 'OQ']","Well, you know, uh, Scott, well, tell me a little bit since you brought that up. Yeah, obviously, drink and tell me a little bit about your [unintelligible 00:07:35]",therapist
85,93,['S'],"Well, I don't really drink like people-- Like some alcoholic or something but, I do—",client
85,94,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
85,95,['S'],I-I like to take the edge off-,client
85,96,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
85,97,['S'],"You know, with a few drinks, you know, not-not a lot, you know, and-and really-",client
85,98,['OQ'],How-how often do you do that?,therapist
85,99,['N'],Not every day.,client
85,100,['CQ'],Maybe every other day?,therapist
85,101,['N'],Maybe.,client
85,102,['O'],Okay.,therapist
85,103,['N'],"Maybe not, uh-",client
85,104,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
85,105,['S'],"You know, it's not all the time, it's-it's not- it's not a problem.",client
85,106,['O'],Okay.,therapist
85,107,['S'],Certainly not a problem.,client
85,108,['OQ'],How would you know if it was a problem?,therapist
85,109,['N'],"Well, if I was like getting arrested for drunk driving.",client
85,110,['SR'],"So, if you got a DUI, you would really know.",therapist
85,111,['S'],"Well, that's what alcoholics do. I'm not an alcoholic.",client
85,112,['O'],Okay.,therapist
85,113,['S'],"Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.",client
85,114,['GI'],"Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.",therapist
85,115,['C'],"Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.",client
85,116,['OQ'],"Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?",therapist
85,117,['C'],I get edgy.,client
85,118,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
85,119,['C'],I-I-I get edgy.,client
85,120,"['CQ', 'CR']",Yeah. And you don't like that?,therapist
85,121,['C'],"No-no. I'd-I'd like to just be normal as well. I'd real-- I'd like to just be normal where I don't have to take medicine, and I don't end up in the hospital three times a year, and I don't find myself in the neighbor's yard—",client
85,122,['SR'],Running around naked.,therapist
85,123,['N'],With a statue. It's—,client
85,124,['O'],Okay.,therapist

85,126,['CR'],You must like that statue.,therapist
85,127,['N'],"I really don't, but, apparently, when I'm in that state, uh, there's something about it, I'm not sure.",client
85,128,['CR'],"So, if-if-if we could maybe find a medication that didn't give you as bad side effects, perhaps you might not have to drink as much or at all or smoke a little weed to take the edge off. I mean, who knows? [unintelligible 00:09:55]",therapist
85,129,['C'],"Well, maybe. I-I-I guess that's possible.",client

86,35,['CR'],You seem motivated to follow the rules.,therapist
86,36,['S'],"Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.",client
86,37,['SR'],It's something that's always on your mind.,therapist
86,38,['S'],"I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.",client
86,39,['CR'],"It takes a lot of, um, strength to still not smoke, even though you're still craving.",therapist
86,40,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
87,0,['GI'],"So let me tell you what I normally do in this, um, this interview, and we-we'll talk for up to maybe 20 minutes or so. Normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-",therapist
87,1,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
87,2,['GI'],"-and then we just talk together about that. So, um, but I always like to just start with wherever you would like to start as well.",therapist
87,3,['N'],"Um, yeah, I, [sigh] that, I mean, like, when I was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, I mean, I guess I don't really think about, like, you know, the drinking being, like, this huge deal and I don't-",client
87,4,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
87,5,['N'],"-ever really think about, like-like, how much I drink.",client
87,6,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
87,7,['N'],"Um, and, like, fi- like filling out, like, how much I'm drinking every day, it was like, whoa, you know-",client
87,8,['O'],Hm.,therapist
87,9,['C'],"-like, I just didn't ever really think about it, like, that I was-- like, if I try to actually count the drinks, it's, kind of, a lot, I mean, it's, kind of, a lot.",client
87,10,['CR'],You were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns.,therapist
87,11,['N'],"Well, yeah, 'cause, like, I also, kind of, thought that, like, I drink, like, about as much as my friends did and then, like, I went back and I was, like, talking to my roommate about it and I was, like, telling her that, you know, I was drinking, like, like 10 drinks on the weekends, like, including Thursday, so like, Thursday, Friday-",client
87,12,['O'],Hm.,therapist
87,13,['N'],"-Saturday, Sunday.",client
87,14,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
87,15,['N'],"And then she was like, ""Sarah, that's cra-- Like, that is crazy. Why are, you know, like, where are you drinking this?"" And I was- I was like, ""Well, you know, like, different places."" And I-I guess, like, I don't know, my friends didn't, like, know. Anyway, it's, yeah, I don't know.",client
87,16,['CR'],"Yeah, this information has opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it, she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you- as you realized when you did the questionnaire.",therapist
87,17,['C'],"Yeah, and yeah, I guess it was just like, I thought that everybody was, like, doing it, you know-",client
87,18,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
87,19,['C'],-but that's not really what was going on. [chuckles],client
87,20,['CR'],"Yeah, the fact that your drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before?",therapist
87,21,['C'],Yeah.,client
87,22,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
87,23,['C'],"Yeah, so, that was the thing that, like, was really the most weird about doing those-",client
87,24,['O'],Okay.,therapist
87,25,['C'],-forms.,client
88,0,['N'],For me.,client
88,1,['CQ'],"So, um, everyone that comes on the South Whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that they'd like to work on in the next 30 days. Because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?",therapist
88,2,['C'],"Um, I have to start getting the school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class.",client
88,3,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","Okay, so for you getting on time for first hour is something you'd like to work on the next 30 days?",therapist
88,4,['N'],Yes.,client
88,5,['OQ'],Okay. What a great goal. So why do you want to make this goal for yourself?,therapist
88,6,['C'],"Uh, so people will get off my back.",client
88,7,['CQ'],And who are these people?,therapist
88,8,['C'],"My mom she's always saying, you know, get to school. My PO will be like, you know, if you don't get the school on time, I can bring you back in for sanctions and I don't want to go back in.",client
88,9,"['CQ', 'SR']",So that's something you definitely wanna avoid?,therapist
88,10,['N'],Yes.,client
88,11,"['NEGO', 'SR']",Okay. So getting to school for your first hour is something that you're going to work on as your goal.,therapist
88,12,['C'],I will try.,client
88,13,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?,therapist
88,14,['N'],"I can't ever get up in the morning. So that's hard and then by the time I do get up, and then I get ready and get dressed, I miss the bus. So then I usually end up walking or see if I can find a ride. So it could be a bunch of different reasons why I'm late.",client
88,15,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay, so it's not just one major thing?",therapist
88,16,['N'],No.,client
88,17,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","So knowing that a couple of things can really get in your way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What do you know you need to do?",therapist
88,18,['C'],Get up on time would probably be a good start of making me get there on time.,client
88,19,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",What time would you need to get up then?,therapist
88,20,['S'],"[sighs] If I'm gonna catch the bus I'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard to do, 'cause I go to bed so late and I don't know if I can do it.",client
88,21,['CR'],So you're still kind of unsure if this is something that you could do yet you're saying you really wanna do it because you don't wanna go back for sanctions.,therapist
88,22,['C'],Right. I could try-,client
88,23,['O'],Okay.,therapist
88,24,['N'],- and see how it goes.,client
88,25,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt it?",therapist
88,26,['N'],Yes.,client
88,27,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",So what time would you have to go to bed at night to make sure you're up by 6:15?,therapist
88,28,['C'],"I go about midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I can try 11:00.",client
88,29,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","Okay. Okay, so you're willing to go to bed at 11:00 and then you're going to set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?",therapist
88,30,['N'],Yes.,client
88,31,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",When would be a great day for you to start this?,therapist
88,32,['N'],"Uh, either tomorrow or the next day.",client
88,33,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Okay, so if I would write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to write? Tomorrow or the next day?",therapist
88,34,['C'],Let's start tomorrow.,client
88,35,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Tomorrow. Okay, great. So who would be able to help you get to bed on time and make sure you're up on time by 6:15?",therapist
88,36,['N'],My mom.,client
88,37,['SR'],Your mom.,therapist
88,38,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
88,39,['CQ'],Okay. Anything that your mom could do to help you with that?,therapist
88,40,['C'],"[sighs] She can after my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that I said to you that I'm going to get up so that I have to do it.",client
88,41,['CR'],"So it's almost like you want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want your mom to remind you, ""Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour class"".",therapist
88,42,['N'],Exactly. Yup.,client
88,43,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",Great. What could maybe get in the way of you not getting up by 6:15?,therapist
88,44,['N'],[sighs] Not going to bed on time.,client
88,45,['SR'],Not going to bed on time.,therapist
88,46,['S'],"Yup, that's gonna be a struggle for me.",client
88,47,"['NEGO', 'SR']",Okay. So if you are feeling tempted to stay up later-,therapist
88,48,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
88,49,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",- how could you respond instead?,therapist
88,50,['C'],"Just go to bed and turn off the lights, don't have my phone.",client
88,51,"['CR', 'NEGO']","Okay, so a phone is a distraction for you. So keeping your phone away-",therapist
88,52,['N'],"Oh, yeah.",client
88,53,"['CQ', 'CR', 'NEGO']",- and even actually turning the lights off and making sure that it's dark?,therapist
88,54,['N'],Yes.,client
88,55,['CR'],Kind of a reminder it's time to go to bed.,therapist
88,56,['C'],Have my mom check on me to make sure everything's put away.,client
88,57,['SR'],And-and also the support of your mom too.,therapist
88,58,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
88,59,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",Great. So how will you know that you-your plan is working?,therapist
88,60,['C'],"When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class.",client
88,61,"['CR', 'NEGO']","So for you being in your class, when that bell rings, then you know, this is the goal.",therapist
88,62,['N'],Absolutely.,client
88,63,['CR'],"So what I've been hearing so far- what again, what a great goal. You've already had some insight of how to do this. So for you, it's really important that you're getting to your first hour because you don't want to go back to sanction days. You don't having- like having all these extra people checking up on you and all those things.You've already have a plan of going to bed by 11:00, turning off the lights, putting your cell phone away. Even the support of your mom is really gonna be helpful for you, um, getting up at 6:15 in the morning with that alarm. I know that seems really early in the morning, but you seem willing to do it. And if you're not able to do it, your mom's gonna help you out as well.",therapist
88,64,['C'],"Well, yeah, I hope so.",client
88,65,"['NEGO', 'SR']",What a great plan and you said you're going to start tomorrow.,therapist
88,66,['C'],I'll give it a try.,client
88,67,['O'],"Great. Well, thank you.",therapist
88,68,['N'],You're welcome.,client
89,0,['OQ'],Tell me a little bit about what brings you today.,therapist
89,1,['N'],"Well, my wife is making me be here today. Uh, she thinks that it's a problem that I'm smoking weed, so she said, ""You need to go and get some help.""",client
89,2,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. Um, so you said that your wife said it's a problem. Um, so do you not feel like it's a problem for you?",therapist
89,3,['S'],"No, I don't think it's a problem at all. It's something I do to help me relax. In fact, I think it's something that is good for me, but—",client
89,4,['OQ'],"Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about how, like, it's-it's not an issue for you?",therapist
89,5,['S'],"Yeah. You know, like I said, you know, I'll come home, I'll, you know, smoke a couple rolls after a long day or something. I'm able to just relax, not really think about things. You know what I mean? I'm still working and, you know, paying the bills. We have a house, so I don't- I don't know why it's a problem.",client
89,6,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, is it causing any problems in areas like your marriage or anything like that?",therapist
89,7,['C'],"I mean, I guess a little bit, you know, like-- I mean, she's the one that-that has me being here. We've been fighting about it, you know. Uh, uh, I don't know, I-I guess I'm-I'm getting pretty frustrated with her. She just won't get off my back about it. So I finally said, ""Fine, I'll go see someone.""",client
89,8,['CQ'],"Okay. Um, so are you here to maybe work on your marriage? Is that an area that you are wanting to-to work on?",therapist
89,9,['C'],"Uh, I mean, I'm just here because she said that I need to be in here. So, I mean, yeah, I wanna save my marriage, you know.",client
89,10,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
89,11,['C'],"And, I mean, I love her, you know, but I'm here because she's making me be here.",client
89,12,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, what is it that you wanna get out of being here?",therapist
89,13,['C'],"Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.",client
89,14,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?",therapist
89,15,['C'],"Well, I mean, I just failed the UA at work. Uh, I think I failed UA at work. I don't know. I-I use- I use some stuff that was [inaudible 00:02:00] not my system. But-",client
89,16,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
89,17,['C'],I don't- I don't think it's gonna work. And so I really liked to be able to keep my job.,client
89,18,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
89,19,['C'],"Um, I'd l- I'd like to stop fighting with my wife. Um-",client
89,20,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
89,21,['C'],-I guess those are my big goals.,client
89,22,['CQ'],"Okay. Um, do you see your substance use as being, um, maybe a cause of those other issues at all? Do you see them linked at all?",therapist
89,23,['C'],"I mean, yeah, I guess- I guess if I think about it, that's kind of the common theme.",client
89,24,['OQ'],"Okay. Okay, um, how do you think that your substance use is going to affect your employment?",therapist
89,25,['C'],I'm pretty worried that I'm gonna get fired.,client
89,26,['O'],Okay.,therapist
89,27,['C'],I don't- I don't really know. We're the only shop in town that-that does the work that we use. So I don't- I don't know what else I'm gonna go do.,client
89,28,['O'],Okay.,therapist
89,29,['N'],So—,client
89,30,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, and if you lost your job, what do you see being the consequences of that?",therapist
89,31,['C'],"Um, my wife might leave me. Uh, might lose the house. Um, can't pay my bills.",client
89,32,['CQ'],Okay. Do you see that at all as being affected by the substance use?,therapist
89,33,['C'],"Yeah, it's probably- it's probably the reason why all that's happening. I mean-",client
89,34,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
89,35,['C'],"-If I lose my job, it's 'cause I failed the UA, so—",client
89,36,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, so can you talk to me a little bit about, um, maybe where you wanna be 90 days from now? What do you want your life to look like?",therapist
89,37,['C'],I'll still have a job.,client
89,38,['O'],Okay.,therapist
89,39,['C'],"Still have a wife and, uh, yeah, if I-- If those two things can happen then, you know—",client
89,40,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
89,41,['C'],"I mean, I know if-if I lose my job, she leaving me. She's been getting after me about smoking weed for a long time, so—",client
89,42,['OQ'],"Okay. So that's where you wanna get to. Um, what do you think that you need to do in the next, like, month or so to maybe help going in that direction?",therapist
89,43,['C'],Probably need to go talk to my boss and start taking some steps not to lose it.,client
89,44,['O'],Okay.,therapist
91,0,['O'],"Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.",therapist
91,1,['N'],"Good morning, doctor.",client
91,2,['OQ'],How can I help you today?,therapist
91,3,['N'],"Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD.",client
91,4,['O'],Yes.,therapist
91,5,['C'],And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.,client
91,6,['O'],Right.,therapist
91,7,['C'],"So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.",client
91,8,"['CQ', 'SR']","It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-",therapist
91,9,['N'],A respirologist.,client
91,10,"['OQ', 'SR']","A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?",therapist
91,11,['N'],"I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well.",client
91,12,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
91,13,['C'],I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.,client
91,14,['CR'],"All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened.",therapist
91,15,['N'],Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.,client
91,16,['CQ'],"Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?",therapist
91,17,['S'],"I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself.",client
91,18,['CR'],"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.",therapist
91,19,['N'],"I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch.",client
91,20,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
91,21,['N'],"I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit.",client
91,22,['SR'],"Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital.",therapist
91,23,['S'],"I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked.",client
91,24,['OQ'],"Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?",therapist
91,25,['S'],"Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand.",client
91,26,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
91,27,['C'],"Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves.",client
91,28,['O'],Right.,therapist
91,29,['S'],"I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.""",client
91,30,['CR'],"Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?",therapist
91,31,['N'],That's right.,client
91,32,['CQ'],Okay. Is there anything I missed?,therapist
91,33,['S'],"Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me-",client
91,34,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
91,35,['C'],"-we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family.",client
91,36,['O'],Right.,therapist
91,37,['N'],"The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard-",client
91,38,['O'],Sure.,therapist
91,39,['N'],"-have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us.",client
91,40,['CR'],So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.,therapist
91,41,['N'],"I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right.",client
91,42,['OQ'],"You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?",therapist
91,43,['C'],"Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well.",client
91,44,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
91,45,['C'],I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.,client
91,46,['OQ'],Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?,therapist
91,47,['C'],"Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics.",client
91,48,['CR'],"Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking.",therapist
91,49,['N'],Yes.,client
91,50,"['OQ', 'SR']","So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?",therapist
91,51,['C'],"It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking.",client
91,52,['CR'],Definitely most important.,therapist
91,53,['C'],"Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things.",client
91,54,['OQ'],"Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?",therapist
91,55,['N'],"Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent.",client
91,56,['SR'],35-40%. Okay.,therapist
91,57,['C'],"Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-",client
91,58,['CR'],"Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit.",therapist
91,59,['C'],"Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So-",client
91,60,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
91,61,['C'],"-this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week.",client
91,62,"['OQ', 'SR']",Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?,therapist
91,63,['C'],"Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help.",client
91,64,['SR'],"So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%.",therapist
91,65,['N'],I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today.,client
91,66,['O'],Okay.,therapist
91,67,['N'],Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out.,client
91,68,"['ADVI', 'CR', 'OQ']","Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?",therapist
91,69,['N'],"In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically.",client
91,70,['GI'],That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.,therapist
91,71,['C'],"Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge-",client
91,72,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
91,73,['C'],"-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.",client
91,74,['OPTI'],"Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?",therapist
91,75,['C'],"No, that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week.",client
91,76,['SR'],"Excellent. Well, thank you so much for coming in today.",therapist
91,77,['N'],"Thank you for seeing me, doctor.",client
91,78,['O'],You're welcome.,therapist
93,0,"['CR', 'NEGO', 'OQ']","So there are a lot of different directions that we could take. Um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. You've mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what's on your mind is as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?",therapist
93,1,['C'],"I think the activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. Um, I feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that that could be good to help maybe some of the other changes happen later.",client
93,2,"['NEGO', 'SR']",Yeah. Okay. So physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first.,therapist
93,3,['N'],"Yeah, I think so.",client
93,4,"['CR', 'NEGO', 'OQ']","Great. So tell me a little bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and I know you've shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less irritable and stressed. Any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?",therapist
93,5,['C'],"Yeah, I think just to feeling like physically stronger, um, like physically more able. Uh, last night I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And then really to like, I think if I am more active, I think my body image or my body confidence would improve also.",client
93,6,['SR'],Yeah. So you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and- and also just have a better sense of confidence.,therapist
93,7,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
93,8,['CQ'],"Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?",therapist
93,9,['N'],"Hmm, I'd say I'm about an eight.",client
93,10,['SR'],Okay. So you're- you're feeling fairly motivated.,therapist
93,11,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
93,12,['OQ'],"Uh, why didn't you pick a six?",therapist
93,13,['C'],"Well, like I said, I just, I've identified like a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, if I were to be more active and I definitely wanna have that improved mood and energy, um, and feel better about myself. Um, so yeah, all of those things I think are what's really driving that- that rating.",client
93,14,['CR'],"Okay. You're noticing there- there are too many great benefits to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence.",therapist
93,15,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
93,16,['CQ'],Am I missing anything else?,therapist
93,17,['N'],I don't think so.,client
93,18,['SR'],Okay. Those are the big ones for you.,therapist
93,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
93,20,['NEGO'],"Fantastic. Well, um, now we can start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-",therapist
93,21,['N'],"Mm-hmm, yeah.",client
93,22,['O'],"- and- and what activities you might end up, um, choosing.",therapist
93,23,['N'],"Yeah, that'd be great.",client
93,24,['O'],Okay.,therapist
94,0,['O'],"Good, so, um, we're here today to talk just, uh, about whatever it is you'd like to talk about it.",therapist
94,1,['N'],"Um, how about if we talk about, uh, the problem that I'm really having is, um, getting somebody motivated to do something, um, such as move out of my house.",client
94,2,['SR'],"Okay, so, um, there would be, so what you're, what you're attempting to do is, um, well-- Tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a little bit more about it so I understand it a little bit more.",therapist
94,3,['N'],"Well, I-I offered my home to somebody and, uh, for, you know, uh, a transitional period.",client
94,4,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
94,5,['N'],"You know, and it seems that, um, it's hard for me to be assertive and say I think the, um, the, uh, transitional period is- has come and it's beginning to time to transition. So.",client
94,6,['CR'],"So that's a really kind thing of you to do to take someone into your home like that when they need help like that. And, um, but right now, you're thinking that, uh, time is up you'd like to get this person, you know, you're-you're-you're ready to have him or her move out and have your place back to yourself.",therapist
94,7,['C'],"Yeah, that's, it's absolutely right that I want, I-I want change but I'm not, I am kind of, like, weak in that area where it's, like, the ability to actually say the words. You're right, yeah. I'd like to be able to do that.",client
94,8,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. And what would, uh, what would help you get to the point of actually, um, booting them out?",therapist
94,9,['S'],"Um. [sighs] I don't know, I'm-I'm, I guess, I'm kind of, um, I care about the person and, you know, there's a certain amount of comfortability of having somebody with you, you know, and I'm just, so, I guess I am at war with myself because part of me wants the comfort of having a companion and the other part of me is just, you know-- I-I cannot-- I am not really sure what I wanna do, you know.",client
94,10,['CR'],"Mm-hmm. So you kind of feel two ways about it. You-you'd like to, um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the house and in knowing he's around.",therapist
94,11,['C'],"Yeah, you know, it's kind of, like, the old sock- song saying hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more. [laughs] And—",client
94,12,['CR'],But you're not quite ready if you wanna sing that song.,therapist
94,13,['N'],"[laughs] Well, first of all I think he would hit the road if I started singing that song 'cause I can sing. [laughs]",client
94,14,['CR'],"I thought you did a pretty nice job singing there right there, it's scary to be quite honest with you and I appreciate, I also appreciate your sense of humor in-in doing that.",therapist
94,15,['N'],"Well, you know, in life you have to have a sense of humor in my- the way I view and otherwise, you know, I'd be like where's the news. [laughs] I mean, it's either—",client
94,16,['CR'],That really helps you get through things is to be able to laugh about it.,therapist
94,17,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, I have to laugh, I mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of-- What I've heard about comedians is that they are really not always that happy and they use that in a comical way to, you know, deal with life, so, yeah. [laughs] I kind of, maybe I should go into that. [laughs] Like this girl—",client
94,18,['SR'],Your new career.,therapist
94,19,['N'],"Yeah, like this girl Ruth that I know she's-she's, uh, got a serious job and she kind of does that on the side. [laughs]",client
94,20,['OQ'],"So, um, what are the uh, uh, what would be the benefits to you right now to having him out of the house?",therapist
94,21,['N'],"Mm. Let's see. Well, you know, I'm really not sure, I kind of, you know. Um, I'm having a hard time with that. Um.",client
94,22,['OQ'],Tell me a bit more about that.,therapist
94,23,['N'],"Mm, well, I have to really think about it because-",client
94,24,"['CQ', 'CR']",Some guilt?,therapist
94,25,['S'],"Yeah, yeah. Maybe some guilt and I, um, uh, I just, you know, [sighs] I go back and forth a little bit, you know.",client
94,26,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
94,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
94,28,['CR'],Cause you wanna do the right thing because you're- because you're a good person and that's a- that's a really important value to you is that you- is that you help people out.,therapist
94,29,['N'],"Yeah, I-I- yeah. I mean I- thank you. I-I-I appreciate you saying that I'm a good person. Like I feel I am. Um—",client
94,30,['CR'],But you've done your duty. Duty is done.,therapist
94,31,['C'],"Yeah. Oops, it's just hard to- it's just hard to, um, er, yeah. I- my j- my job is done and I have to start to realize that I have to be a little bit more assertive, I think, and a little bit more, um, sure of myself.",client
94,32,['OQ'],"And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?",therapist
94,33,['N'],"Well, um, I've had co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-not so pleasant, but I'm-I'm just making, you know, 'cause I happen to sometimes just like hold things in. And then finally I- at-at one point I was really, you know, very logical about it. And then the other day I kind of got not so logical about it.",client
94,34,['O'],Okay.,therapist
94,35,['N'],[laughs],client
94,36,['O'],"So, uh, you were telling me earlier though that you've talked to some other people and he has some options about some other places to go to.",therapist
94,37,['N'],Yeah. That's the good thing that he does. And I mentioned them. I-I-I discussed that with him.,client
94,38,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
94,39,['C'],"And that gives me a relie- a sense of relief. Like I'm not just, you know, saying yeah. You know, go find your own place or, you know, I mean, there are places where he has a safety net to go to and that-that is something that I think I feel better about and that it makes it easier to discuss and giving them options that he can-- Yeah, yeah, exactly.",client
94,40,['CR'],"So, you might have to literally like pack his bags and help them get to those places, um.",therapist
94,41,['N'],"Been there, done that. [laughs]",client
94,42,['SR'],Okay. Are you-- This is something you've done before.,therapist
94,43,['N'],Yeah.,client
94,44,['CQ'],So whe-when-when are you gonna do it?,therapist
94,45,['N'],"Well, um, I told him within a couple of days is, you know. I think, um, I-I- cause I have future plans, um, and some things that are up in the air with me as far as where I'm going to be living in. I've had this place for seven years, but I'm not sure, you know. Every day is a new- a new, uh, winding road that we go down, you know?",client
94,46,['O'],"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.",therapist
94,47,['N'],Um.,client
94,48,['CR'],And it's kind of scary.,therapist
94,49,['N'],"Oh, God, yeah, yeah. But, you know, and it's scary to have an extra, a huge extra trunk that you have to carry with you [chuckles].",client
94,50,['SR'],And he's that extra trunk.,therapist
94,51,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
94,52,['O'],Okay.,therapist
94,53,['C'],"But I-I mean and it's not that I don't care about him, I do. But you know, it's just like, we're both- we're all adults here, come on.",client
94,54,['SR'],"Okay. All right. So, it sounds like you-you've actually worked this out until be out within a couple of days.",therapist
94,55,['C'],"Um, that's the goal, you know.",client
94,56,['O'],Okay.,therapist
94,57,['C'],"And I don't know what his plans are, but those are my plans.",client
94,58,['O'],"Okay. Well, I have a funny feeling your plans will prevail. [laughter]",therapist
94,59,['N'],"I like your way of thinking, girl. I-I'll tell him that. [laughs].",client
94,60,['O'],"Well, thanks for-for talking and playing with our little things here.",therapist
94,61,['N'],Thank you,client
95,0,['OQ'],"Right. Hi, Ruth, thank you for coming today. How are you?",therapist
95,1,['S'],"Um, okay. Just, I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm-I'm just so stupid. I'm such an idiot. I didn't know what the point of-of this is. I just- I just keep doing the same thing over and over, even though I know it can kill me. I just, I don't have any more willpower, ma'am. Yeah, [foreign language].",client
95,2,['CR'],"Well, Ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated first of all. And you're saying that you're just tired. You've lost all your willpower.",therapist
95,3,['S'],Mm-hmm.,client
95,4,['SR'],You don't want to continue.,therapist
95,5,['S'],"No, it just seems that cutting myself is the only way out. And I just get suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], I'm just very, very like depressed and what's going on at home.",client
95,6,['SR'],"So you feel really, really like you've had it up to here.",therapist
95,7,['S'],Yeah.,client
95,8,['CR'],Yeah. You're-you're tired. You're stressed. You feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now.,therapist
95,9,['S'],"Yes. Sometimes a pain in-in the body. It's, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and-and the pain inside of me.",client
95,10,['CQ'],So you were in a lot of pain?,therapist
95,11,['S'],Yes. I am.,client
95,12,['CR'],"I'm sorry about that. It must be very, very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like the only thing that you can do right now is to cry.",therapist
95,13,['S'],"Yeah, yeah, suicide.",client
95,14,['SR'],"It's okay, Ruth. I understand. Pain inside.",therapist
95,15,['N'],[foreign language],client
95,16,"['OQ', 'SR']","So your mom doesn't understand you and you don't have a dad, that's around?",therapist
95,17,['S'],"Yeah, 'cause she's a single mom and she struggles a lot. I wanna help her, but I can't help her. So it just makes me sad. I feel like if I don't live anymore, she'll be okay. And she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay my stuff.",client
95,18,['CR'],"So you feel like your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single parent. She works a lot. You have all of these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you feel like you're just adding more problems to her.",therapist
95,19,['S'],Yeah.,client
95,20,['SR'],"And if you're not alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. She'll do better.",therapist
95,21,['N'],I-I think so?,client
95,22,['OQ'],How is she gonna be better off without you?,therapist
95,23,['S'],Because it won't be a burden to her.,client
95,24,['OQ'],And how are you a burden now?,therapist
95,25,['S'],"Because she has to pay for my food and my uniforms, um, to have a roof over our heads.",client
95,26,['OQ'],And how do you help her now?,therapist
95,27,['C'],"Um, I try to be a good kid. I tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I'm not failing any classes.",client
95,28,['CR'],"Okay. So then even by you coming here today, Ruth, and talking to me and opening up and telling me that you don't feel like you want to continue moving in and telling me and-and confiding in me that, you know, you hurt yourself and all this pain that you feel, that is you trying to help yourself out in one way or another. And that shows that you care. And even more, it shows that you care about your mom and that, in the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave her alone because you're still worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens on her that you're even thinking of removing yourselves to make her life easier. That shows me that you care about her so, so much, but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems like it's-it's-",therapist
95,29,['S'],That's the right one.,client
95,30,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","-How could it be the right one? Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, she's a single parent. She doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. So how could it be the right choice? But I understand your pain and I know where you're coming from. And I know that the release that you feel physically is something that helps you in the moment. Are there other things that we can help you find to start replacing, um, that behavior?",therapist
95,31,['S'],"Um, I don't know. I don't know. It's just, um, I'm not sure I can.",client
95,32,['CR'],"You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you've been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is good. You go most of the time, you know, you're trying to keep up your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of those things shows how much effort you've put in and we see that effort. So you've been doing what you can and it's normal to feel like sometimes it's not enough. But that's-that's what we're here for so that you can tell us those things and we can help you.",therapist
95,33,['C'],"Thank you, ma'am, I feel better.",client
95,34,['O'],"Oh, thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today.",therapist
95,35,['N'],Okay.,client
96,0,"['OQ', 'SR']","Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?",therapist
96,1,['N'],"Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, I guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, um, yeah, well, I'm doing what I'm told.",client
96,2,"['OQ', 'SR']",So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little bit about that?,therapist
96,3,['N'],"Uh, yeah, he is concerned about my alcohol intake.",client
96,4,['CR'],Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.,therapist
96,5,['S'],"Uh, no.",client
96,6,['CR'],"No. Okay. So that's- that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point.",therapist
96,7,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
96,8,['OQ'],Okay. So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?,therapist
96,9,['S'],"Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a little with my friends if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of a family tradition with supper. So-",client
96,10,['O'],Okay.,therapist
96,11,['N'],Yeah.,client
96,12,['CR'],"So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-",therapist
96,13,['S'],"Yeah, and I, you know, I-I have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook and-and, you know, things that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think it's kind of an old wives' tale. So, you know, I'm independent and I'm gonna- I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body.",client
96,14,['CR'],"Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit.",therapist
96,15,['S'],"Yeah. You know, I've looked it up to see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to support my argument.",client
96,16,['O'],Okay.,therapist
96,17,['S'],"Yeah, which is that, um, I'm going to do what I- do what I wanna do and what I know, right? So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, um, I'm here anyway. So-",client
96,18,['CR'],So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.,therapist
96,19,['S'],Nope. I never have been.,client
96,20,['CR'],"Okay. And I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've got these messages from friends.""",therapist
96,21,['N'],Yep.,client
96,22,['CR'],"""Um, media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong.""",therapist
96,23,['N'],Mm-hmm. I think so.,client
96,24,"['CQ', 'CR']",You're not sure if he's sort of playing things up a little bit there?,therapist
96,25,['N'],"Yeah. I mean, you know-",client
96,26,['SR'],It might be a bit extreme to-,therapist
96,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
96,28,"['OPTI', 'OQ', 'SR']","-to quit drinking. Um, I'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, is that something you'd be open to?",therapist
96,29,['N'],Like right now?,client
96,30,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
96,31,['N'],Uh-,client
96,32,"['CQ', 'GI']","What if- uh, can I show you a brochure about that?",therapist
96,33,['N'],"Uh, yeah, I guess.",client
96,34,['CQ'],Yeah?,therapist
96,35,['N'],Sure.,client
96,36,"['GI', 'OQ']","Well, if we take a look at the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?",therapist
96,37,['S'],"Well, you know, I've-I've heard these kinds of things before, but I just- I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk, you know, I don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that.",client
96,38,['CR'],"So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-",therapist
96,39,['S'],It's the same thing.,client
96,40,['OQ'],-to con- sort of convince you that-that it might be dangerous to be drinking through alcohol?,therapist
96,41,['N'],"Yeah. It's just a fancy little brochure saying what I've already known, I've already heard.",client
96,42,['CR'],"So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit.",therapist
96,43,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
96,44,['CR'],"And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. Tell me about that information that you've-you've explored.",therapist
96,45,['S'],"Um, well, I've looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I- as I said, I personally know people who haven't had any problems. Um, so that's about the extent.",client
96,46,"['CQ', 'CR']","Mm-hmm. You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that.",therapist
96,47,['N'],"Like, uh, I don't like- have like a bibliography or anything.",client
96,48,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist

96,50,['CR'],"So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.",therapist
96,51,['N'],"Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?",client
96,52,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
96,53,['N'],"You know, it's kind of like the ""why"" that it's like-",client

96,57,['N'],"Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?",client
96,58,"['CQ', 'CR']","Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?",therapist
96,59,['N'],Yeah.,client
96,60,['CQ'],That was something that you'd been planning?,therapist
96,61,['N'],Yep.,client
96,62,['OQ'],"Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?",therapist
96,63,['N'],"Um, well, it's-it's really important to me. That's a big priority of mine is to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you know, be a good parent.",client
96,64,['OQ'],Mm. What does being a good parent look like? Tell me more about that.,therapist

96,74,['CR'],"That's something that- that really matters to you and, um, I'm-I'm hearing you say that, you know, protecting your baby is important to you and at the same time, um, kind of clashes with some of the information that's in the brochure.",therapist
96,75,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
96,76,['OQ'],What do you make about that- what do you think about that?,therapist
96,77,['N'],"Um, well, I just don't know- I just don't know where-where these brochures get their information or-or anything from, like, where's the hard evidence essentially.",client
96,78,['SR'],You wanna see it in black and white.,therapist
96,79,['N'],Yeah.,client
96,80,"['GI', 'OQ', 'SR']","You wanna know that it's the latest and the greatest kind of thing.

There's the-the evidence that we have, um, but in the end, you choose what's best for you and what's best for your baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on that?",therapist
96,81,['C'],"Um, well, it surprises me that that's based on research from out of 2011, um, and I must have missed that. I guess, you know, if it is, um, you know, I do wanna do what's best for my baby and for myself. And if I have to quit drinking, um, I guess ultimately I have to-I make that decision, um, but, um, that's a lot of, uh, information to take in today.",client
96,82,['CR'],"Mm-hmm, kind of feels like, you know, you were making some really good decisions about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your baby up well and take care of your baby. And I-I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you saying that and it kind of feels like this information isn't kind of what you were expecting to hear.",therapist
96,83,['N'],Nope.,client
96,84,['OQ'],"What would you feel like would be helpful as far as next steps, like when you think about maybe moving away from drinking alcohol throughout the rest of your pregnancy?",therapist
96,85,['C'],"Um, well, first things first, if I could take a brochure home maybe, um, you know, show it to my partner and-and-and get-get their support, um, I think that's really gonna help me, and kind of changing our-our habits, or, you know, putting the alcohol away, out of sight. Um, I think that's probably the best thing I can do, like, today when I get home.",client
96,86,['CR'],"Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps you're talking about. You're talking about putting the alcohol away, that's huge. That's-that's really big steps.",therapist

96,88,"['CQ', 'OPTI']","I really want to thank you for, you know, exploring this with me today, and I'm wondering if we can kind of continue this conversation again, and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking and, um, the- giving you a chance to do some more research and, you know, maybe looking through these brochures and kind of just coming back and sharing a little bit more about, you know, what you thought about the information and what feels right for you. Is that something you'd be open to?",therapist
96,89,['C'],"Yeah, I think that- I think that would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, yeah, with, like, ways to approach it because I think that my partner kind of has the same view that I- that I had. So-",client

97,27,['N'],"Yeah, I mean, okay, fair enough, um, I've got to have my blood pressure-",client
97,28,['O'],"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",therapist

97,61,['C'],"Um, yeah, I mean, who doesn't? I mean, I'm aware that I'm over my, uh, uh, b-b-b-balance weight, but I now know that it's causing problems. I mean, obviously, I get out of breath if I have to do something a bit howering, and I realize that I'm on this blood pressure-",client
97,62,['O'],Right.,therapist
97,63,['C'],"-um, and-and maybe that's probably contributing to it.",client

Um, you're- you're- you're aware of the- of the links between your health and your weight, and you are concerned, to some extent, about that, and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it, it's just that your life is busy and rushed, and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done.",therapist
97,81,['N'],"Yeah, I mean, I, to a certain extent, because of my lifestyle, food is just fuel.",client
97,82,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist

98,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,20,['GI'],"Um, and also, if there's any-any-any information that you need from me, please, um, feel free to ask. Um, that the reason that he asked you to come in was because of the blood alcohol level was 2.8.",therapist

98,62,['CQ'],"So, um, looking back, Mike, uh, when was it that you started thinking that when you did use alcohol, um, most in your life?",therapist
98,63,['S'],"Um, there was really not a time that I, uh-- I don't know. I-I don't understand the question really. I mean, it-- There really wasn't-- I don't really drink on a normal basis, so, I don't know-- [crosstalk]",client
98,64,"['CQ', 'SR']","So, that is- that is a complete, uh-- A question that is even applicable?",therapist

98,67,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,68,['O'],That's fine.,therapist

98,71,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,72,['GI'],"And so, that's sort of why I was asking about it earlier in your life if that was a--",therapist
98,73,['N'],"It seems like every time that I, uh, do drink more than a couple of drinks, I tend to get in trouble. And, the two times that I did, I got in trouble both times. [crosstalk]",client
98,74,['SR'],It was those two times. Yeah.,therapist
98,75,['N'],"Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's-- It sounds strange, I know, but, uh--",client

98,77,['N'],"Yeah. Actually, that-that's followed me around pretty much my whole life, the bad luck thing.",client
98,78,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
98,79,['S'],But the-the-the-the-the alcohol hasn't really at all.,client
98,80,['O'],"Oh, okay.",therapist

98,82,"['CQ', 'SR']",But just that bad luck?,therapist
98,83,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,84,['CQ'],Yeah. Is there alcohol with the- with-- Goes hand in hand with the bad luck or just--,therapist
98,85,['N'],Sure seems like it. Yeah. It sure seems like that.,client
98,86,['CQ'],"Yeah. Oh, okay. So-so, what about that? The-- Is there other incidences that you could think of that seems, uh, um, alcohol was there, and then your luck just sorta took a-a turn, or it was just those two times?",therapist
98,87,['S'],"Um, you know, I don't really, um-- I-I don't really, uh, get into a situation where I-I-I drink too much. Um, you know, again, I-I realize it's my second DUI, but,, um, uh-uh, it isn't something that, um, is like a normal everyday process for me.",client
98,88,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
98,89,['S'],"Um, you know, normally when I drink, I drink one or two drinks and then I stop. Um, so, it's not like it's, um-- You know, it's not like it's something that has become a problem in my life, you know.",client
98,90,['CQ'],"Oh, good. Oh, good. And-and so, where do you usually, um, have your drinks? Is it at home or, uh, out-out for, uh- after work, social drinking?",therapist
98,91,['N'],"Um, it's normally social.",client
98,92,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
98,93,['N'],"Yeah. It's normally social. It would be, you know, maybe in events or something like that is normally when I would, um, maybe drink more than one or two.",client
98,94,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
98,95,['C'],"I guess I should probably just call a taxi cab or something, you know. That way, I wouldn't have this problem.",client
98,96,['CQ'],Would that help?,therapist
98,97,['C'],"Um, probably, I think that would help. I think that would be something that I should, uh- I should work on.",client
98,98,['CR'],"So, it sounds like you've already been thinking about, uh, ways to-to get around safely.",therapist
98,99,['C'],"Yeah. Yeah, or I can just stay home probably too. If I was gonna drink, I could probably stay home, then I wouldn't get in trouble either.",client
98,100,['O'],You have been giving this a lot of thought.,therapist
98,101,['N'],"Yeah, a little bit.",client
98,102,['O'],"Yeah, good.",therapist

98,106,['O'],No.,therapist
98,107,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,108,['CQ'],"Yeah. So, tell-tell me a little bit more about, um, when you fi-- If you'd find yourself, and then that-that thought comes about maybe doing something other than getting in the- in the car, does that come and go, or-or is it something that you think you-- Next time you might do?",therapist
98,109,['C'],"Um, oh, I'll never get in the car when I'm drinking again. That-- Yeah. I-I would never do that again.",client
98,110,"['CR', 'OQ']","This, it-- What-what-what was different?",therapist

98,114,['CR'],Wow. You-you need your license-,therapist
98,115,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,116,['CR'],-to get around. You need your license for work.,therapist
98,117,['N'],"Well, and then I-I sell cars for a living too, so--",client
98,118,['O'],Oh.,therapist
98,119,['C'],"-um, you know, that would be, um-- You know, I don't wanna lose my job either. You know, I think those would kind of be connected together.",client
98,120,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
98,121,['N'],"And, you know, I-- You're not gonna call my work or anything for this, are you?",client

98,127,['N'],Okay. I just didn't know how that worked.,client
98,128,['O'],"Oh, no.",therapist
98,129,['N'],"Because I think if they found out, I might, you know, be in jeopardy with my job. So--",client
98,130,['O'],"Well, you're here. And-and-and I have you give, uh-uh, credit for that. It took a lot to come in today and, um, when, um- when somebody is actually talking safety for themselves, which I-I hear you saying, um, calling a taxi or-or staying home.",therapist
98,131,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,132,['OQ'],"So, what does staying home look like for you? Is that something that-- You know, you-you talked about drinking at an event. Would staying home be--",therapist

98,134,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
98,135,['C'],"So, maybe I would just, uh-- I think I'll just have people come over to my house instead of going somewhere else, you know.",client
98,136,['CQ'],That would work for you?,therapist
98,137,['C'],"Yeah, I think so, and probably a smarter thing to do. I don't wanna go through this again, you know.",client
98,138,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
98,139,['N'],Yeah.,client
98,140,['CQ'],"Uh, so, uh, would people come and drink at your house, and then they would be fine with that?",therapist

98,149,['S'],"For my first DUI, I did, uh-- I didn't drink at all for about six months.

But, you know, again, it wasn't uh-- You know, it was a little different last time, because I was drinking a little more last time than, you know, now. I don't really drink as-as much as I used to drink, you know, um, and, you know, after you know, I quit for six months, so I kind of knew that I didn't really have a problem.",client

98,161,['N'],"Probably 'cause I didn't- I wasn't drinking with them, I guess. I don't really know. I mean, it seemed, uh--",client
98,162,['CQ'],Did you ask them?,therapist
98,163,['N'],"Um, no. I really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang with them. You know? I mean, it was, uh-- She said that if I, you know, kept hanging out with them guys, that she wasn't gonna be with me anymore.

98,164,['CR'],And your girlfriend's important to you-,therapist
98,165,['N'],Sure.,client

98,174,['CQ'],"Oh, okay. So-so, um, you started drinking again, and then she left?",therapist
98,175,['N'],"Uh, it was about the same time. I really don't know which came first. It was about the same time. Uh, we were getting in a lot of arguments. I just didn't quite feel myself. You know, I-I-I wasn't-- My friends weren't around. I, uh-- You know, I missed going out with them.",client
98,176,"['CQ', 'SR']",You felt isolated?,therapist
98,177,['N'],"Yeah. It was kind of weird 'cause I felt like she was trying to control me, and, uh- and uh, you know, I, uh-- And she was telling me what to do all the time, and I just, uh, didn't feel right about the whole situation. So, it was pretty much, we both decided, you know, that it just wasn't the right thing to do, so.",client
98,178,['CR'],"And, so you're-you're an independent guy-",therapist

98,181,['N'],"Well, I guess. Sure. Yeah.",client

98,187,['S'],"I don't really know that I can really compare good or bad. I just, uh-- You know, I just drink to be social, you know, I don't know that it really changes anything about me. It just, uh-- You know, I just drink to be social, you know.",client
98,188,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm. And those friends that were not hanging around with you, did they come back?",therapist

98,345,['N'],"I'd have to really think about it. I don't really have too many good friends. You know, I have some acquaintances that don't drink but-",client

98,357,['N'],"Well, they just mess with me until I get-- You know, until I drink a beer with them, you know. So--",client

98,385,['O'],"-and then, um- and then it would be up to you mostly. The choice is-is completely yours. And, um, it sounds like to me that there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this.

98,386,['C'],"Um, probably just not really drink as much. I mean, if I just didn't drink, I wouldn't have to really worry about that too much either.",client
98,387,['SR'],Then you wouldn't have to worry.,therapist

99,0,['OQ'],"Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking.",therapist
99,1,['N'],"Okay, like what?",client
99,2,['SR'],"Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.",therapist
99,3,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
99,4,['CQ'],Does that sound realistic?,therapist
99,5,['N'],"Yeah, uh, on the weekends?",client
99,6,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?",therapist
99,7,['S'],"No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-",client
99,8,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
99,9,['S'],-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.,client
99,10,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
99,11,['S'],"In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep.",client
99,12,"['GI', 'SR']","Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.",therapist
99,13,['C'],"Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much.",client
99,14,['GI'],"Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.",therapist
99,15,['N'],"Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad.",client
99,16,"['OQ', 'SR']","That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?",therapist
99,17,['C'],"I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five.",client
99,18,['OQ'],"Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?",therapist
99,19,['C'],"Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five.",client
99,20,['CR'],"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.",therapist
99,21,['N'],Yes.,client
99,22,['OQ'],"Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?",therapist
99,23,['C'],"Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking.",client
99,24,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?",therapist
99,25,['C'],"Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers.",client
99,26,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?",therapist
99,27,['C'],"Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.",client
99,28,"['ADVI', 'SR']","Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements.",therapist
99,29,['N'],Thanks.,client
99,30,['SR'],"So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going.",therapist
99,31,['N'],Sure.,client
99,32,['O'],Okay. Good.,therapist
100,0,['OQ'],"There, um, what brings you in today?",therapist
100,1,['C'],"I don't know. I'm just having a little bit of, uh, having a little bit of trouble dealing with, uh, my criminal history and, uh, you know, trying to stay on the right path, but, you know, um, it's just- it gets, you know, it gets kind of overwhelming, you know. Um, I really wanna be, you know, a good productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, I got this background that nobody will overlook, you know. So it kinda makes it like, well, what, you know, do I go back to what I know?I mean, you can only work for $5, $6, $7 an hour for so long, and it's really frustrating. It's causing, uh, some anger issues to resurface and some depression to resurface and, um, you know, and, um, I don't wanna fall back, you know.",client
100,2,['CR'],It's really getting in the way of you becoming who you wanna be.,therapist
100,3,['N'],"Yes, it is.",client
100,4,['OQ'],Yeah. So what-what-what about your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you wanna be?,therapist
100,5,['N'],"I don't know what about it is, um—",client
100,6,['CQ'],"There's a, uh, your record has a conviction?",therapist
100,7,['N'],Yeah. It has a felony conviction on it.,client
100,8,['SR'],"Okay. Ah, there's-",therapist
100,9,['N'],"And, uh—",client
100,10,['SR'],-the big trouble. Yeah.,therapist
100,11,['N'],"Yeah, it is. And it's- I hadn't anticipated that it would have been-- You know, so at the time, it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I'm not going to jail.""",client
100,12,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
100,13,['S'],"You know, and, um, now, it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that they were offering. You know, I mean, I think it would have been bad either way, but, um, I hadn't anticipated that this was gonna be this difficult, especially since I went back to school and, you know, uh, got a degree and actually want to do, you know, some, um, corporate level or, you know, professional type of work.",client
100,14,"['CQ', 'CR']","Mm-hmm. So when you, um, when you put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to knock you out of the ballpark. You're not even considered as an applicant?",therapist
100,15,['N'],"No, I'm not. Um, in situations where I don't know about it, I don't know about, I mean, if I'm not considered because of that, I probably-- Um, you know, that sucks too. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I-I don't- I don't get callbacks a lot because of that issue-",client
100,16,['O'],"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",therapist
100,17,['N'],"- I'm sure. The ones that really count are-are-are, you know, are kind of just, you know, uh, making me so angry and, you know, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life or the ones that I get face face, especially after a really good interview. And, you know, most of the times, I interview extremely well. And, um, it's, you know, I get the vibe that the job is offered almost halfway through the interview because, you know, they start telling me about what I'll be doing and what I'll be getting.And then, you know, when it comes to sign on the paperwork and I believe in honesty, so I tell them, you know, hey, look, this is what you're gonna find, you know, and, um, try to explain it. It's just-it's almost like night and day.",client
100,18,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
100,19,['N'],"Black and white. It just stops right there. ""I'm sorry. I can't really do much for you. I-- You have to go,"" you know, and it's—",client
100,20,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?",therapist
100,21,['N'],"No. I mean, there's different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask and, you know, I'll say something like, you know, ""We'll discuss at interview"". Uh, sometimes, there are situations where if I probably put that, I don't get a callback and those situations I don't know about. You know, but there are also times where I get an interview through, um, you know, uh, uh, some sort of connection or something, or like a buddy of mine or a family member will send me on an interview. You know, I don't have to fill it out- fill out an application for that. They just usually, you know, give you the interview. And at the end-",client
100,22,['SR'],Seems like it's a done deal.,therapist
100,23,['N'],Yeah. It seems like it's a done deal. You just have to go through the motion of having the interview. And then-,client
100,24,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
100,25,['N'],"-when I go through the interview and it goes well, and they're like, ""Okay, well, you know, I think we can do something"" and then, ""Here, sign this, sign that,"" and the other thing. And it's like, but we just had a great, you know, I mean, I qualify. Like what does that have to-- Seven years ago, six years ago, what does it have to do with anything? Now, especially because, you know, the type of conviction, it wasn't a non- it wasn't a violent conviction. It's not like I'm a danger to the staff around me. It's not like it's a, you know, a theft type of thing. It was, you know, it was a possession, you know what I mean?",client
100,26,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
100,27,['N'],And,client

100,35,['C'],"I do, yeah.",client
100,36,['CR'],"Yeah. And, um, and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and the leper colony.",therapist

100,38,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Um, have there been any times when you've started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even have to go through the whole thing and then get rejected?",therapist

100,51,['ADVI'],"Right. If that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, I'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else. I mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record.",therapist

Should I just drop out and just, you know, get jobs that are, you know, I mean, that's not enough, that's not a viable option for me either.You know, I just, I don't, I wanna make sure that I'm centered here so that I can go out there and do the best I can with maintaining composure, and then trying to get ahead.

101,27,['S'],"Well, I know my drinking has increased a little since I got divorced and moved to Portland, but I-I don't think it's that much of a problem.",client

101,31,['N'],I didn't realize that drinking had anything to do with blood pressure.,client
101,32,['GI'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, it can sometimes.",therapist
101,33,['C'],"Oh, well. Well, then I guess that could be a problem.",client
101,34,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking. What-what do you think about that?",therapist
101,35,['C'],I guess I can cut down some.,client
101,36,['OQ'],"Okay. So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale?",therapist
101,37,['N'],I'd probably a 6.,client
101,38,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?",therapist
101,39,['C'],"Well, I didn't realize that drinking was related to my blood pressure problems.",client
101,40,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
101,41,['C'],"And I did fall earlier this year on my home from the bar and hurt my shoulder. I don't think the drinking made me fall, but it probably didn't help the situation.",client
101,42,['O'],Okay.,therapist
101,43,['C'],"And though my son keeps telling me that I'm drinking too much, and it's scary to think that my drinking is harmful. It's a big word.",client
101,44,"['CQ', 'SR']",Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit.,therapist
101,45,['C'],Sounds like it to me.,client
101,46,['SR'],Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar.,therapist
101,47,['C'],"I think I can try to do that, yeah.",client
101,48,['OQ'],Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking?,therapist
101,49,['C'],"I guess I could use those numbers, and I can't make any promises, but I could try to drink less than three in a night and less than seven in a week.",client
101,50,['O'],Okay. Okay.,therapist
101,51,['C'],That mean I can only drink two or three times a week.,client
101,52,"['CQ', 'SR']",Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying?,therapist
101,53,['C'],"Like I can try that, yeah.",client
101,54,['O'],Okay. Okay.,therapist
101,55,['C'],"I don't think I need to quit, but I think I can try to cut down.",client
101,56,['CQ'],And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week?,therapist
101,57,['C'],That's what I'll shoot for.,client
101,58,['NEGO'],"Okay. I think that sounds like a great step for you as your doctor. Why don't we revisit this the next time you come in to talk about your blood pressure in about six weeks or so and, um, then we can see how you're doing with it.",therapist
101,59,['N'],Okay.,client
101,60,['O'],All right?,therapist
101,61,['N'],Sounds good.,client
101,62,['O'],"Well, let's get back to your blood pressure then and see what we need to do about that.",therapist
101,63,['N'],Okay.,client
103,0,['O'],"Thanks for coming back, [unintelligible 00:06:00]. I know last time we talked about, uh, maybe going out and joining some activities in the community-",therapist
103,1,['N'],Yeah.,client
103,2,['O'],"-to work on meeting some people, so-",therapist
103,3,['N'],"Yes, I guess.",client
103,4,['OQ'],-maybe you could tell me about how that's going?,therapist
103,5,['S'],"Well, I didn't do anything yet. I didn't go-- I know I was gonna go, but I didn't. But, um, I did look at-- there's the YMCA, they've got some classes that I think will be pretty cool to go to, and then there's this yoga class over at the Women's Center that's only like 10 bucks, so I could do that, um-- but I didn't go because I'm really afraid that like what if-- you know, what if no-one likes me? What if I don't have friends in there?",client
103,6,['O'],"Yeah, I know you've mentioned that in the past. When we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities-",therapist
103,7,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
103,8,['SR'],-you really mentioned that anxiety-,therapist
103,9,['N'],Yeah.,client
103,10,['O'],-is a big con.,therapist
103,11,['N'],Yeah.,client
103,12,['O'],I remember that.,therapist
103,13,['C'],"Yeah, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because this is what I need to do to make-- you know, to make friends.",client
103,14,['CR'],Okay. To make a change-,therapist
103,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
103,16,['CR'],-that you've wanted for some time.,therapist
104,0,['CQ'],"Before you go, do you mind if I take a look at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?",therapist
104,1,['N'],Okay.,client
104,2,"['CQ', 'GI']","Thanks. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. Does that make sense?",therapist
104,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
104,4,['CQ'],"Great. So, you wrote here that you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?",therapist
104,5,['N'],Yeah. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure.,client
104,6,['OQ'],Okay. How would you describe your drinking?,therapist
104,7,['N'],"Um, I really only drink at parties. I don't drink at home or anything.",client
104,8,['CQ'],Okay. What kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?,therapist
104,9,['N'],"Um, liquor, whenever people are mixing, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but I don't like beer very much. Um, the drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics.",client
104,10,['CQ'],How much do you think you usually drink at a party?,therapist
104,11,['N'],You mean the whole time I'm there?,client
104,12,['O'],Yes.,therapist
104,13,['N'],"Um, probably four or five drinks.",client
104,14,['CQ'],"Speaker 1: Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?",therapist
104,15,['N'],Yeah. It makes me feel relaxed.,client
104,16,['CQ'],And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.,therapist
104,17,['N'],Yeah.,client
104,18,['CQ'],What kind of things do you forget?,therapist
104,19,['N'],"Um, I forget how many drinks I've had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm at.",client
104,20,['SR'],Sometimes you forget where you're at.,therapist
104,21,['N'],Right.,client
104,22,"['CQ', 'GI']","Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?",therapist
104,23,['N'],"Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.",client
104,24,['CQ'],Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?,therapist
104,25,['N'],Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a condom before.,client
104,26,['OQ'],How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?,therapist
104,27,['N'],"Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way.",client
104,28,['CR'],Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?,therapist
104,29,['C'],Yeah. I would've definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.,client
104,30,['GI'],"There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.",therapist
104,31,['S'],"Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.",client
104,32,['OQ'],I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?,therapist
104,33,['S'],"Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun.",client
104,34,['OQ'],Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?,therapist
104,35,['C'],"Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes.",client
104,36,['OQ'],Anything else?,therapist
104,37,['C'],I really don't want any STDs.,client
104,38,['SR'],"Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?",therapist
104,39,['C'],Yeah.,client
104,40,['OQ'],"So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?",therapist
104,41,['C'],"Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.",client
104,42,['CQ'],"How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?",therapist
104,43,['N'],"Um, a nine.",client
104,44,['OQ'],Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?,therapist
104,45,['C'],"Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.",client
104,46,['OQ'],Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?,therapist
104,47,['C'],"Um, well, I wanna count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling drunk.",client
104,48,['OQ'],Great. Who could help you reach this goal?,therapist
104,49,['C'],"Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party.",client
104,50,"['CR', 'OQ']",Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.,therapist
104,51,['C'],I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk.,client
104,52,"['CQ', 'OPTI', 'SR']","All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?",therapist
104,53,['N'],Okay.,client
104,54,['O'],Great. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon.,therapist
105,0,['OQ'],". So, um, tell me about the exercise.",therapist
105,1,['C'],"Well, um, since we spoke last, I've been to the gym a couple of times.",client
105,2,['CQ'],You have?,therapist
105,3,['C'],I have.,client
105,4,['O'],That's fantastic.,therapist
105,5,['C'],"Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a little better too. I'm very pleased with it.",client
105,6,['OQ'],"So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?",therapist
105,7,['C'],"Um, I do feel better.",client
105,8,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
105,9,['C'],My back—,client
105,10,['CQ'],Your-- my what?,therapist
105,11,['C'],"Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much.",client
105,12,['O'],Wow.,therapist
105,13,['C'],"And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm-- I just need to be a little more patient with myself because it's, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not-- I wanna be able to like spend more time at the gym but right now, it's um, not, um-- Well, I guess I need to build up to it.",client
105,14,['OQ'],Mm-hmm. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there.,therapist
105,15,['C'],"Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked.",client
105,16,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
105,17,['C'],"Like last week, I-I didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week,-",client
105,18,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
105,19,['C'],-so it was- it was a frustrating week like for the gym that way.,client
105,20,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
105,21,['N'],"I was kinda busy with some other things, but, um—",client
105,22,['SR'],Mm-hmm. But you made it-- You made it one day-,therapist
105,23,['N'],I-I got—,client
105,24,['SR'],-instead of zero days.,therapist
105,25,['C'],"Yeah, and actually, I made it again on Saturday too. So.",client
105,26,['O'],That's fantastic.,therapist
105,27,['C'],Yeah.,client
105,28,['CR'],"Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on.",therapist
105,29,['S'],"Yeah. It's been a little-little hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a little discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not buff and they are. And it's-it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get, you know, kinda back towards that.",client
105,30,['CQ'],So you-you'd like to get buffed?,therapist
105,31,['C'],"No, but, um, when-when I'm not at the gym, and I am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, way past the age of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then while I'm at the gym, and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then you know, the-- I don't know, the urge to be buff comes up in me.",client
105,32,['SR'],"So, but for right now, it sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-",therapist
105,33,['C'],Yeah.,client
105,34,['CR'],"-sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel good about yourself and—",therapist
105,35,['C'],It is.,client
105,36,['OQ'],What other positive things have you noticed about the exercise?,therapist
105,37,['C'],"Well, I noticed-- Well, I-I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I-I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I've -I've modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with that, but I'd like to do a lot more.",client
105,38,['OQ'],In what way have you gotten a little bit better?,therapist
105,39,['C'],"Um, a little bit less junk food. Um, like at times, when I'm like I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'll just go have a candy bar,"" or some worthless thing like that I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it.",client
105,40,['OQ'],"So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over to actually doing it if you wanted to?",therapist
105,41,['C'],"Well, I think, uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that week-",client
105,42,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
105,43,['C'],"-you know, and then as I'm looking at that double or triple fudge four-decker of ice cream Sunday thing, you know, that somebody is eating, I would say, ""Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill."" Then-then that would be probably-- the-- that would keep me from actually ordering one of those.",client
105,44,['CR'],"Oh, okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth that two hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy browny thingy.",therapist
105,45,['C'],"Right, decadent-- Why do they put the word decadent in food?",client
105,46,['GI'],"'Cause it is decadent, it's lovely.",therapist
105,47,['N'],Okay.,client
105,48,['GI'],"Yeah, yummy, so-",therapist
105,49,['C'],"Okay. But it seems to be going so far so good. I-I guess, you know, I can like, you know, um, I-I'm-I'm pretty pleased with who-- how it's going on. Um, I'm really-- I'm glad we talked that last time 'cause it-it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time.",client
107,0,['O'],"Well, let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself.",therapist
107,1,['N'],"Um, pretty obvious [chuckles].",client
107,2,['O'],"So, what happened. So first of all, tell me what you did, exactly.",therapist
107,3,['N'],What do you mean what I did?,client
107,4,['CQ'],"Well, I mean, where did you cut yourself? I know you said you cut yourself when you-",therapist
107,5,['N'],That's the same as always. Same as always.,client
107,6,['O'],Like your arm?,therapist
107,7,['N'],Yeah.,client
107,8,['CQ'],What did you cut yourself with?,therapist
107,9,['N'],A razor?,client
107,10,['CQ'],How deep?,therapist
107,11,['N'],Do you wanna see it?,client
107,12,['CQ'],"Yeah. Let me see. You know those look to me like they-they-- did you go to the-- It doesn't look like you went and got any stitches, but that looks to me like you could have used them. What do you think?",therapist
107,13,['S'],"I think have you ever been to an ER when you cut yourself, you'd know why I don't go.",client
107,14,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Okay, but part of the problem is those look deep and like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future, if you do it, is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how, um, how this happened. First of all, tell me, you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die. But, um, did you-- Was this a suicide attempt or do you think it was just-just a cutting? Were thinking of killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die when you did it?",therapist
107,15,['S'],"I was thinking about killing myself. You thought you would help me and you didn't. That's what I want to talk about. I wanna talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me, and you are not available to me when I need help.",client
107,16,['OQ'],"Okay. So let's-- Okay, so it sounds like me not being avai-- Was me not being available with you, rela-related to you cutting yourself?",therapist
107,17,['S'],"I cut myself the first time I called you thinking you would help me, you wouldn't help me so then I figured, what the hell I [chuckles] might as well just go all the way. And so, that's why I cut myself that deep.",client
108,0,"['GI', 'OQ']","Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?",therapist
108,1,['N'],"Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately.",client
108,2,['CQ'],"Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?",therapist
108,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
108,4,"['CR', 'OQ']","So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?",therapist
108,5,['N'],"Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.",client
108,6,['OQ'],Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?,therapist
108,7,['N'],"Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not.",client
108,8,['CR'],"Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic.",therapist
108,9,['N'],"Yeah, exactly.",client
108,10,['CQ'],"Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?",therapist
108,11,['N'],"Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.",client
108,12,['O'],Okay.,therapist
108,13,['N'],"Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night.",client
108,14,['CR'],Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.,therapist
108,15,['N'],Yeah.,client
108,16,['CR'],"Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?",therapist
108,17,['N'],Yeah.,client
108,18,['GI'],"Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability.",therapist
108,19,['N'],Yeah.,client
108,20,['CQ'],"Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?",therapist
108,21,['N'],"I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting.",client
108,22,['OQ'],"Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?",therapist
108,23,['N'],"Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts.",client
108,24,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?",therapist
108,25,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
108,26,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?",therapist
108,27,['N'],"Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work.",client
108,28,['CQ'],"Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?",therapist
108,29,['N'],"Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son.",client
108,30,['CQ'],"Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?",therapist
108,31,['N'],"[chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.",client
108,32,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?",therapist
108,33,['N'],"It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights.",client
108,34,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?",therapist
108,35,['N'],"Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit.",client
108,36,['CR'],"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?",therapist
108,37,['N'],"I mean, I think so, yeah.",client
108,38,['OQ'],"All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?",therapist
108,39,['N'],"Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.",client
108,40,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?",therapist
108,41,['N'],Just a couple months from now. He's almost three.,client
108,42,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?",therapist
108,43,['N'],"I've heard of it, but I don't know that much.",client
108,44,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?",therapist
108,45,['N'],"Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure.",client
108,46,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?",therapist
108,47,['N'],"[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much.",client
108,48,"['CQ', 'CR', 'GI']","Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?",therapist
108,49,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke.",client
108,50,"['CR', 'OQ']","Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?",therapist
108,51,['N'],"Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good.",client
108,52,['OQ'],"Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan.",therapist
108,53,['N'],Okay.,client
108,54,['O'],"All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you.",therapist
108,55,['N'],Thanks. All right.,client
108,56,['O'],You're very welcome.,therapist
109,0,['GI'],"Okay, hard part's over. So the good news is no cavities.",therapist
109,1,['N'],"Oh, great.",client
109,2,['GI'],"Yes, always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-",therapist
109,3,['N'],That sounds bad.,client
109,4,['OQ'],"Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now.",therapist
109,5,"['N', 'S']","Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco.",client
109,6,['CR'],"So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.",therapist
109,7,['S'],"But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them.",client
109,8,['CR'],"Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day.",therapist
109,9,['N'],"Oh, no. No.",client
109,10,['CR'],The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.,therapist
109,11,['N'],"Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently.",client
109,12,['CR'],"Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.",therapist
109,13,['N'],"Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis.",client
109,14,['OQ'],"So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?",therapist
109,15,['S'],"Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.",client
109,16,['O'],Okay.,therapist
109,17,['S'],I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.,client
109,18,['OQ'],Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?,therapist
109,19,['C'],"Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking.",client
109,20,['OQ'],Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?,therapist
109,21,['C'],"Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern.",client
109,22,"['CR', 'SR']","Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.",therapist
109,23,"['C', 'N']","Oh, yeah.",client
109,24,['CQ'],"Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?",therapist
109,25,['N'],"Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.",client
109,26,['CR'],Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.,therapist
109,27,['N'],"Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked ""No,"" because I never thought of myself as a smoker.",client
109,28,['OQ'],Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects.,therapist
109,29,['C'],"I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So-",client
109,30,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
109,31,['C'],-I'm very concerned.,client
109,32,['GI'],"Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.",therapist
109,33,['N'],Really?,client
109,34,['CQ'],Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?,therapist
109,35,['C'],"Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you.",client
109,36,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?",therapist
109,37,['C'],"Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this.",client
109,38,['OQ'],"Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?",therapist
109,39,['C'],"Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop.",client
109,40,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here?",therapist
109,41,['C'],"Um, I'd really like some more information about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some new things that can be done to help people make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit.",client
109,42,['GI'],"Okay, well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting.",therapist
109,43,['N'],That'd be wonderful. Thank you.,client
109,44,['O'],I really appreciate you talking to me about this today.,therapist
109,45,['N'],Thank you.,client
110,0,['O'],--today.,therapist
110,1,['N'],"Well, there's a lot of things that bring me here today, but the one thing that I want to focus on is the fact that I really want my son to grow up in a great environment, and just have, like, more than what I had growing up.",client
110,2,['SR'],"Okay. So, you want your son to grow up in a great environment and to have more than you had?",therapist
110,3,['N'],Yes.,client
110,4,['CQ'],Is that right? so that's on your mind right now?,therapist
110,5,['N'],"Yes, that's on my mind. I love my son dearly, and I don't complain about the childhood I had, I had a great childhood. I just-- I guess every parent wants the best for their kids-",client
110,6,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,7,['N'],-and-and I really want the best for him.,client
110,8,['O'],Mm-hmm. Is there anything in particular that's happening right now where this is more of a concern for you than usual?,therapist
110,9,['N'],"Yes, um, me and his father, like, we're-- We were engaged and, um, we're just not at that connection anymore. We're focused on what we want to do in life, and that's kind of put a hassle on our relationship.",client
110,10,['OQ'],What you want to do in life? Can you explain?,therapist
110,11,['N'],"Yes, I want to become a social worker. I want to help people. That's just what I love to do, and he, um, is currently driving trucks, and so it kind of like puts a damper on everything on our relationship, and we're just like mainly focusing on our son and-and it's just been hard, like, reconnecting.",client
110,12,"['CQ', 'CR']",So you feel that your differences in career choices is-is having an impact on your relationship with your son?,therapist
110,13,['N'],"Yes, I feel it is, and I just-- I always really wanted like a family, like me and the dad and-and the child.",client
110,14,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,15,['N'],"I-- That's how I feel, that I love my son dearly, but I want to provide him with that, like, we are together, we're doing it together as a team-",client
110,16,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,17,['N'],-because now that we're going away from each other it's made things more difficult.,client
110,18,['OQ'],"Mm. Okay, so your boyfriend?",therapist
110,19,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
110,20,['CQ'],Is he your fiance or your boyfriend?,therapist
110,21,['N'],"Um, he was my fiance, but-",client
110,22,['O'],Okay.,therapist
110,23,['N'],-we called off our engagement.,client
110,24,['CQ'],Okay. And he's a truck driver?,therapist
110,25,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
110,26,['CQ'],Does he drive long distances-,therapist
110,27,['N'],Yes.,client
110,28,['CQ'],-or just local?,therapist
110,29,['N'],He drives long distance.,client
110,30,['CQ'],"And so sometimes he's gone away from home for, what like, days, weeks?",therapist
110,31,['N'],"Yeah. Days, and the longest was, like, a week.",client
110,32,['CR'],"Okay. And so he's a truck driver and you are an aspiring social worker, and you have a son who you want to give a really great life to, and you feel that you and your boyfriend are in different, going in different directions-",therapist
110,33,['N'],Yes.,client
110,34,['OQ'],-maybe? Is-- Can you elaborate on the part that you're maybe the most concerned about or that's the most on your mind right now?,therapist
110,35,['N'],"I'm concerned that when he was just local, we were able to do picnics and-and-and do the whole family thing that I just really love, and even though my parents weren't together, we would still, you know-- They were really civil with each other and we would go to Disneyland, we'd go to the-the fairs, and you know, I feel like it's different.",client
110,36,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,37,['N'],"Even though I'm not saying that we-we probably won't be together ever, there's a possibility that that could happen, but I still want that togetherness than apart.",client
110,38,"['CQ', 'CR']","Okay, okay. And so that-that realization that you're having right now is, it sounds like, it seems like maybe, just from your nonverbal, that maybe you feel like you need to make some sort of a choice. Is that right?",therapist
110,39,['N'],Yes.,client
110,40,['SR'],Yeah? Okay.,therapist
110,41,['N'],"I feel like, um, I'm not, like, valued. We're not valued from his perspective. I mean, that's-",client
110,42,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,43,['N'],-what I can sense. I can't really make that a final say because he may feel something different.,client
110,44,['SR'],"Well, you know that he's not physically available-",therapist
110,45,['N'],Yes.,client
110,46,['SR'],-to do these things that you want to do-,therapist
110,47,['N'],"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",client
110,48,['SR'],-like go on picnics.,therapist
110,49,['N'],"And so when he is available it's kind of like, I guess where he's at and where I'm at is just like, ""Why is that a problem for you?"" And I'm like, ""It is because I want--""",client
110,50,['SR'],"He's saying to you, ""why is it a problem?""",therapist
110,51,['N'],"Yeah, ""why is it a problem?"" He feels like it's always me who wants these things and-- but I-I made it clear that, you know, I want our son to grow up with the togetherness-",client
110,52,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,53,['N'],"-especially like how my parents had it, you know.",client
110,54,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,55,['N'],"They weren't the best of friends but they could come together and, you know, it was better together than apart-",client
110,56,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
110,57,['N'],"-and so I'm feeling like there's a-a change and I don't know whether to roll with it or just accept it, accept it. And it's all a balance between mind and-and heart and that's the battle.",client
110,58,"['CR', 'OQ']","So, your heart says you want this great relationship where there's like a true family unit and you can go on picnics and be together but your mind says, what?",therapist
110,59,['N'],"Well, my mind says that it's not going that way and you can't make it turn that way, you can't change anybody, they have to change themselves.",client
110,60,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
110,61,['N'],"And if they wanted to do it then, you know, it would definitely work.",client
110,62,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
110,63,['N'],"And I feel like I don't wanna subject to just accepting things the way they are, especially if that's a concern for me-",client

110,65,['N'],"-as far as dealing with the togetherness, I feel like if I have a problem, I voice it to you and we solve.

110,80,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
110,81,['N'],"-but I don't-I don't sense it, I don't feel it and, um, I think that's just what I'm going by and I feel like probably 98% true.",client

111,29,['CR'],So smoking pot doesn't help you feel more socially comfortable with your peers and it increases your stress because you're worried about your family and legal consequences?,therapist
111,30,['C'],Yeah.,client
111,31,['OQ'],Can you think of any other downsides to smoking pot?,therapist
111,32,['C'],"Well, I don't have the money for it. I just usually bum it off to my roommate, her parents give her a lot of spending money but I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to have to do that.",client
111,33,['CR'],So smoking pot also reminds you of your financial situation and you don't have extra cash to spend on things?,therapist
111,34,['C'],Yeah.,client
111,35,"['OQ', 'SR']","Katie, it sounds like smoking pot is helping you somewhat in helping you relax and it's also causing you a lot of stress because you're trying to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about getting caught, you're worried about family disapproval. Having said all that, what do you think you wanna do about your pot use?",therapist
111,36,['C'],"I don't know. When you put it that way, it doesn't sound like a very good habit.",client
111,37,['CQ'],Would it be okay if I made a suggestion?,therapist
111,38,['N'],Okay.,client
111,39,['CQ'],"You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation that you have a history of dealing with anxiety, have you ever talked to a counselor about that?",therapist
111,40,['N'],No. We don't do that kind of thing in my family.,client
111,41,['OQ'],Can you tell me more?,therapist
111,42,['S'],It's just not done. I don't know. It's something for crazy people and we definitely do not have the money for it.,client
111,43,['CR'],Mm. So the idea of counseling in your family is for crazy people only and it's looked down upon and the cost would cause a problem too?,therapist
111,44,['S'],Yeah. I just don't see it happening.,client
111,45,"['CQ', 'GI']","Katie, we know that many kids come to college and have a lot of stress and deal with a lot of anxiety, and we've also found that when they talk to our counselors and learn specific skills about dealing with anxiety, they do much better. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot of kids. Um, I'm wondering if you think it might be helpful for you?",therapist
111,46,['N'],I don't know.,client
111,47,['OQ'],Can you describe why you're hesitant?,therapist
111,48,['S'],"Well, I don't have the money for it so I can't pay for it and my parents wouldn't approve.",client
111,49,['GI'],"Well, the cost is free and the counseling services we provide, we are legally obligated to protect your privacy. We can't tell your parents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're concerned about- that your safety.",therapist
111,50,['N'],"What, like suicidal?",client
111,51,['O'],Exactly.,therapist
111,52,['N'],"Uh, I would never do that.",client
111,53,['GI'],"Well, uh, we can go into some more specifics if you decide to see the counselor about what-what privacy rules there are, but for the most part, you wouldn't need to worry about us sharing anything with your parents.",therapist
111,54,['N'],Okay. I guess I'll think about it.,client
111,55,['OPTI'],"So, uh, if-if you're walking out now, I can walk out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors.",therapist
111,56,['N'],Do I have to go there?,client
111,57,['GI'],"No. No, no. I just wanted to show you where it is and let- make sure you know about our resources here at the college.",therapist
111,58,['C'],"Okay, sure. I agree, let's go.",client
112,0,['GI'],"So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.",therapist
112,1,['N'],"Okay, oh, actually, could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately. Well, prior to that party, like, as you know, I'm a honor student and my parents, like, they keep me very, like k-kept down out of the, like so- like social life.",client
112,2,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,3,['N'],"And, um, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. And they used the fact that, Oh, I'm always doing my homework, I'm always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on-- well, that party, I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house. So, that's when I started drinking.",client
112,4,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,5,['C'],"It was a- it was a unique experience, as you can say. I guess you can say. And, I don't know, I-- It was fun, at least, in the moment. So, I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my-- I begged my mom to let me go to another party. And she, kind of, knew what I was doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of no alcohol, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, ""You drank vodka."" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor. And I-I feel terrible because I-I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.",client
112,6,['CR'],"So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.",therapist
112,7,['N'],Right.,client
112,8,['CR'],And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.,therapist
112,9,['C'],"Yes, right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.",client
112,10,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,11,['N'],"I haven't really-- I kind of just sit in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on the weekends, where instead of-- I was- I was instead of studying, I caught up with my friends, trying to find where we can-- I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that.",client
112,12,"['CR', 'OQ']",It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?,therapist
112,13,['S'],"I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. I don't know it just—",client
112,14,['CR'],"So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more relaxed.",therapist
112,15,['S'],Exactly.,client
112,16,['CR'],"Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-",therapist
112,17,['C'],Kind of.,client
112,18,['OQ'],-or any other things?,therapist
112,19,['C'],"Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of scene.",client
112,20,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,21,['C'],"So, that-that-that's also changed.",client
112,22,['CR'],"So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now.",therapist
112,23,['N'],"A little bit because not all of them are into that. So, like, I'm in one group of friends, and I would talk to another person that's an another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.",client
112,24,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,25,['C'],"So, since then, I've been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that oh, I'm just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before.",client
112,26,['O'],Okay.,therapist
112,27,['C'],"As they are there for me, you know.",client
112,28,"['CR', 'OQ']","Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?",therapist
112,29,['C'],"Oh, um, I feel I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I understand that situations like this will happen.",client
112,30,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,31,['C'],"It's just up to me not to take it so far, where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking. All I remember is the toilet-",client
112,32,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,33,['C'],"-that's-that's not worth it, either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow. It's little so I guess may seem to other people.",client
112,34,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
112,35,['C'],But to me then it's a big thing.,client
112,36,['CR'],Your mom is really important to you.,therapist
112,37,['C'],Of course.,client
112,38,['CR'],And how she feels about you is important to you.,therapist
112,39,['C'],Exactly.,client
112,40,['OQ'],"How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?",therapist
112,41,['C'],A lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother.,client
112,42,['O'],Okay.,therapist
112,43,['C'],And also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too.,client
112,44,['O'],Okay.,therapist
112,45,['C'],So I feel that there-there's a future in that.,client
112,46,['OQ'],How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?,therapist
112,47,['C'],"I'm pretty confident, especially.",client
112,48,['CQ'],O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.,therapist
112,49,['N'],Probably like an 8 or 9.,client
112,50,['O'],Okay.,therapist
112,51,['C'],And that can't be a ten there's nothing as ten in life I feel. Like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to.,client
112,52,['OQ'],Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?,therapist
112,53,['C'],Because I don't know I feel deter-determined to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I-I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.,client
112,54,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,55,['C'],"It's not a pleasant experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that just it's not worth-it's not worth drinking.",client
112,56,['OQ'],"All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?",therapist
112,57,['C'],"To make sure I have my studies. Well first, try to get-get back my trust with mother-",client
112,58,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
112,59,['C'],-then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink. And I do one cup is not going to do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that. I prefer just make sure.,client
112,60,['CR'],"So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a maximum of one at the very most.",therapist
112,61,['C'],Exactly. Just so I take part with the social convention but it's not. Hey guys.,client
112,62,"['CR', 'GI']","Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a good plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you.",therapist
112,63,['N'],And-and thank you for listening me listening to me. It means a lot to me.,client
112,64,['GI'],It's my-- yeah it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like this so. I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.,therapist
113,0,['O'],"Hi, Sandra.",therapist
113,1,['N'],Hi.,client
113,2,['SR'],"Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.",therapist
113,3,['S'],"Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil.",client
113,4,"['CR', 'OQ']","So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about?",therapist
113,5,['C'],"I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing.",client
113,6,['SR'],So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.,therapist
113,7,['C'],"I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her.",client
113,8,['CR'],"Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.",therapist
113,9,['S'],"Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now.",client
113,10,['OQ'],"So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?",therapist
113,11,['S'],"It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out.",client
113,12,['OQ'],What else? Tell me what else is good about it.,therapist
113,13,['S'],"Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight.",client
113,14,['OQ'],Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?,therapist
113,15,['S'],"Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much.",client
113,16,['CR'],"So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.",therapist
113,17,['N'],Okay.,client
113,18,['CR'],"So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.",therapist
113,19,['N'],That's true. Yeah.,client
113,20,['CR'],"You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.",therapist
113,21,['N'],Yeah.,client
113,22,"['CQ', 'CR']","I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?",therapist
113,23,['N'],Exactly.,client
113,24,['SR'],So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?,therapist
113,25,['C'],"Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking.",client
113,26,['OQ'],"Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?",therapist
113,27,['C'],"Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke.",client
113,28,"['CR', 'OQ']","So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?",therapist
113,29,['C'],"I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan.",client
113,30,['CR'],"And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-",therapist
113,31,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
113,32,"['CR', 'OQ']","-um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together?",therapist
113,33,['C'],"It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, but I don't think it's right.",client
113,34,['OQ'],"So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?",therapist
113,35,['S'],I can't think of anything right now.,client
113,36,['O'],Okay.,therapist
113,37,['S'],I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about.,client
113,38,['CR'],"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?""",therapist
113,39,['N'],Exactly.,client
113,40,"['CQ', 'OPTI']",Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?,therapist
113,41,['N'],"Oh, sure. Sure, I'll come in. Yeah.",client
113,42,['O'],Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk],therapist
113,43,['N'],We can talk about it some more.,client
113,44,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?",therapist
113,45,['N'],"Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.",client
113,46,['O'],"Okay, here you go.",therapist
113,47,['N'],Thank you.,client
113,48,['SR'],"So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week.",therapist
113,49,['N'],All right.,client
114,0,"['GI', 'OQ']","In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox.

114,1,['N'],"Uh, I guess that sound- that sounds right. I mean, I was- I was kinda drunk and it happened like a week ago. I just, I drove over to my friend's house, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a couple beers and next thing I know the Vikings are kind of losing pretty big. So we drank a little bit more than usual. And I mean, at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride. So I-I just drove.",client

114,4,['SR'],"Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends.

114,11,['C'],"God. It's, I guess, super important, because just-just going to detox alone was-was awful, the experience-- I don't want to do that again. And my dad said if I get suspended from school, um, I have to go- I have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social life. I won't see any of my friends and I mean, it's already bad enough, like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI.",client
114,12,['OQ'],Yeah. What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?,therapist
114,13,['C'],"Well, I guess I- I guess the easy one is I wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more-more likely to get in trouble. So probably I don't wanna drink so much.",client

114,16,['OQ'],What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or eight?,therapist
114,17,['C'],"I could probably, um, I don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so thenI'm not risking myself to drive or like if I- if I go out to a party waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking, like, I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do than just drink.",client

making the changes you mentioned?",therapist

And then I get to my 8:00 AM and I'll just sleep through and then miss just about everything that's on the test.

117,55,['N'],"No, this hasn’t happened before.",client
117,56,['OQ'],"Oh, this is the first time anything like this has come up?",therapist
117,57,['N'],"Um, due to just circumstance of, I mean, I just yeah, had my boyfriend for six years before that and-",client
117,58,['O'],"Yes, yes.",therapist
117,59,['N'],"Um, before that yeah just my friends weren't drinking so much, and yeah it’s just not, it's just new. Yeah.",client
117,60,['O'],"Okay, yeah. Well, it’s great that you’re able to identify, you know, what’s going on at the moment and you've-- not only know that, you almost picked up on a bit of a pattern too you're in-",therapist
117,61,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
117,62,['OQ'],"-as to why you’re-you're drinking. In terms of looking at cutting back on-on drinking, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100 and 100, uh, meaning it’s tremendously important for you and 0 not important at all. How important is it for you to cut back on the drinking?",therapist
117,63,['C'],"I believe 80, I mean I guess that’s why I’m here so—",client
117,64,['O'],"Okay, yeah yeah sure, you're already taking a huge step forward in many ways by coming along to-to start talking about it.",therapist
117,65,['C'],Yeah.,client
117,66,['OQ'],"Um, I guess 80 is quite high, what makes you say an 80 over say 50?",therapist
117,67,['C'],"Um, I don’t know, I just-just I don’t know, it just sort-- it just got up to a point where just, um, it seemed just too much, like no-nobody else is really drinking as much in the week as well and-",client
117,68,['O'],Okay.,therapist
117,69,['C'],"-it seemed, as just, yeah, for the reasons I was saying, just seeing like I need to do something about it now.",client
117,70,['SR'],"Okay, yes, so you’ve got this real sense of, ""I've gotta do something.""",therapist
117,71,['C'],"Just seeing it’s just gonna get worse, uh, wha-- that’s what it seems like.",client
117,72,['SR'],That’s what it seems like.,therapist
117,73,['C'],Yeah.,client
117,74,"['OQ', 'SR']","So, at the moment, it's been a case of the last six months, this is a pattern that you’ve been noticing more and more, um, a sign that it has had negative impacts on your lifestyle which you’re not happy with and you are in you're in a position where, you know what? I wanna do something about it.",therapist
117,75,['C'],Yeah.,client
117,76,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Okay, I mean what do you think that next step is?",therapist
117,77,['C'],"Um, I guess that’s why I’m here. [chuckles]",client
117,78,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
117,79,['C'],"Just to, uh, but um-- I is-is-- I think the weekdays is what I really need to do.",client
117,80,['O'],Okay.,therapist
117,81,['C'],"Um, and then, I don’t know, try to plan it out a little bit more on the weekends-",client
117,82,['O'],Okay.,therapist
117,83,['O'],-so it just doesn’t go crazy.,therapist
117,84,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Okay, okay, so you’re thinking about perhaps looking at trying to keep weekdays free of alcohol? Was that what you were saying?",therapist
117,85,['C'],"Yeah, yeah. Yep.",client
117,86,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","Okay, how does that sound like a first step goal for you?",therapist
117,87,['C'],"No, that’s good, that’s-that's, yeah, that's- that is definitely what I’m gonna do.",client
117,88,['O'],Okay.,therapist
117,89,['C'],"I just, you know, I'm so out of the routine, not exercising, I need to get back into things.",client
117,90,['CR'],"Okay, you sound really mad about it to-to turn it around.",therapist
117,91,['C'],"Yeah, but I mean, I guess, just talking about it makes me think oh yeah, I need to- I need to do something about it.",client
117,92,['O'],"Okay, oh, that-that's excellent, okay.",therapist
119,0,['OQ'],Thanks for coming in. Tell me what's been happening since we last spoke.,therapist
119,1,['N'],"Well, I, um, I did get an interview for a job. Um—",client
119,2,['O'],"Wow, that's so great.",therapist
119,3,['N'],"Yeah, but I wasn't able to go, um, cause my kids, I didn't have any one to watch them. And, um, you know, so the- that was sort of game over. I just, I had to cancel the interview and this, it's too bad because it was a really, a- actually was a job that would have been good, but I don't know.",client
119,4,['CR'],You sound disappointed.,therapist
119,5,['C'],"Well, yeah, because it's- it's, you know, I didn't really have a choice. I guess I have to be- I have to make sure my kids are taken care of first. And, um, you know, I'm worried that this is gonna keep happening.",client
119,6,['SR'],It's gonna keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities.,therapist
119,7,['N'],Yeah.,client
119,8,['CQ'],"Mm-hmm, okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?",therapist
119,9,['C'],"Um, it sits about at a 10 because yeah, I mean, I'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just, what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it. So I really need to have a job and soon.",client
119,10,['SR'],Yeah. You're-you're-you're it.,therapist
119,11,['N'],Yeah.,client
119,12,['SR'],You have to provide for your children.,therapist
119,13,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
119,14,['CQ'],"Um, and tell me on a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?",therapist
119,15,['S'],"I mean, right now, I think I'm about at a three. I just seems like, you know, even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare, you know, when I show up, I've got this resume that it's- it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job. So I just feel like I'm not, um, I don't know, that employable.",client
119,16,['CR'],"So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful.",therapist
119,17,['N'],Yeah.,client
119,18,['SR'],And then also it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so great about your resume and your experience.,therapist
119,19,['S'],"Yeah. Yeah, because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working, I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now.",client
119,20,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",Okay. What is it that you- what is it that you want?,therapist
119,21,['C'],"I just want something that is- is gonna be steady and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that I can be home every night and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get something where, um, I'm just making good money and- and I don't have to worry all the time about money.",client
119,22,['CR'],"Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.",therapist
119,23,['N'],Yeah. It would be huge.,client
119,24,['SR'],Mm-hmm. It would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much.,therapist
119,25,['C'],Yeah. And it'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine.,client
119,26,['SR'],Right. So every day you know where you're going.,therapist
119,27,['N'],Yeah.,client
119,28,['SR'],"Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week.",therapist
119,29,['C'],"Right. Well, it would be good if I knew, you know, that my kids are taken care of too-",client
119,30,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
119,31,['N'],- so I'm not worried about them while I'm at work.,client
119,32,['CR'],Right. Yeah. Because you're- you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.,therapist
119,33,['N'],Right.,client
119,34,['OQ'],"Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a little bit more confident about getting work?",therapist
119,35,['C'],"Well, I mean, being able to make the interviews would be the priority.",client
119,36,['O'],"Okay, Yeah.",therapist
119,37,['C'],"Um, so chi- you know, taking care, having some childcare, having-",client
119,38,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
119,39,['C'],- having someone I trust that I can call when I know I've got an interview.,client
119,40,['SR'],Yeah. Because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.,therapist
119,41,['N'],Right. Yeah.,client
119,42,['SR'],"So having taken care of that part, having some reliable childcare would definitely help.",therapist
119,43,['N'],Yeah.,client
119,44,['OQ'],What else would get you to a five?,therapist
119,45,['C'],"Um, I just wish that I had- I had more experience or, um, you know, more education. It seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume.",client
119,46,['O'],Okay.,therapist
119,47,['N'],I get asked about education and training and –,client
119,48,['O'],"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",therapist
119,49,['S'],"- um, you know, I just, it, as soon as I asked about it, I just feel just like I'm not good enough-",client
119,50,['O'],Okay.,therapist
119,51,['N'],- since I don't have that.,client
119,52,['CR'],"Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, that you would feel proud of yourself.",therapist
119,53,['C'],"Yeah. Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type of certification where I could say, I could, you know, with confidence talk about- about that.",client
119,54,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- do you have any ideas as to what fields you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?",therapist
119,55,['C'],"I mean, I guess, I just don't really know what it's gonna be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure.",client
119,56,['SR'],Like what's going to be fastest.,therapist
119,57,['C'],"Right. I almost feel like that's more important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now.",client
119,58,['CR'],"Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really quickly like a short- a short certificate.",therapist
119,59,['C'],"Yeah or something-- yeah, something that I could get immediate skills that would, you know, get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, career just- just get me into something and then I can always focus on.",client
119,60,"['CR', 'NEGO']","Yeah, sort of like a short-term or transition into something else.",therapist
119,61,['N'],Yeah. Great. Exactly.,client
119,62,"['CQ', 'CR', 'NEGO']",But that would be steady and pays well?,therapist
119,63,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
119,64,"['CR', 'NEGO']","Okay, and allow you to afford everything you need to afford.",therapist
119,65,['C'],"Yeah, because even those jobs right now don't feel accessible for me. They seem like, you know-- seems like if-- maybe if I were better on the computer or you know.",client
119,66,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","Okay, so specifically getting some computer skills will help?",therapist
119,67,['N'],Yeah. I think so- I think so because I don't-- I can't-- I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about—,client
119,68,['CR'],The technology.,therapist
119,69,['N'],Yeah.,client
119,70,"['CR', 'NEGO']","Mm-hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, um, getting some child-- reliable child care certainly sounds very important.",therapist
119,71,['N'],Yeah.,client
119,72,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers?",therapist
119,73,['C'],"Yeah, that would be great.",client
119,74,['O'],Okay.,therapist
119,75,['N'],That would be great.,client
119,76,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","So what would you like to do next, you think?",therapist
119,77,['C'],"Well, find the childcare resources-",client
119,78,['O'],"Okay, okay.",therapist
119,79,['N'],- is- seems to be- that seems to be the—,client
119,80,['CR'],That's a priority.,therapist
119,81,['C'],The priority 'cause I can't even do an interview without that.,client
119,82,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
119,83,['C'],"And then, um, I mean-- I guess getting into some type of- some type of a training program that's, you know, short-",client
119,84,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
119,85,['N'],"- like maybe there's a weekend, I mean—",client
120,0,['O'],"Well, I'm glad we figured that out and I think you'll feel better over the next few days.",therapist
120,1,['N'],"Oh, thanks so much doctor. I'll just take it easy for a couple of days.",client
120,2,['CQ'],"Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?",therapist
120,3,['C'],"Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do.",client
120,4,['CR'],I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges.,therapist
120,5,['S'],"Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm just concerned about how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time.",client
120,6,['NEGO'],"Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready.",therapist
120,7,['N'],"Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?",client
120,8,['NEGO'],"Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life.",therapist
120,9,['S'],"I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day.",client
120,10,['NEGO'],"Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing.",therapist
120,11,['C'],I like to walk.,client
120,12,['GI'],Me too. Walking is great exercise.,therapist
120,13,['S'],"Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?",client
120,14,['GI'],"Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym.",therapist
120,15,['C'],"Oh, wow, that sounds good. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work and I saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment.",client
120,16,['O'],That sounds great.,therapist
120,17,['C'],"And you know what? I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in such a long time.",client
120,18,['GI'],"Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun.",therapist
120,19,['C'],Hmm. And I know my family would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing.,client
120,20,['CR'],"Oh, that's great to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym.",therapist
120,21,['C'],"Yeah, and you know what? I really like to try that.",client
120,22,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?,therapist
120,23,['C'],"Actually, I really would. I'm kind of excited about it. What else you got?",client
120,24,['GI'],"Well, small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement in your day.",therapist
120,25,['C'],Mm-hmm. I can do that.,client
120,26,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help.,therapist
120,27,['N'],"Diet, the D word.",client
120,28,"['CR', 'GI']","Not necessarily. What we eat is certainly important for weight and health, but just like we did today, we can talk about some small steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that you feel good about.",therapist
120,29,['C'],"Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away, doc.",client
120,30,['O'],That's great. I'll see you soon,therapist
121,0,['O'],"Uh, welcome. And, uh—",therapist
121,1,['N'],Thank you.,client
121,2,['GI'],I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-,therapist
121,3,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
121,4,['SR'],I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.,therapist
121,5,['N'],From my GP?,client
121,6,['SR'],"From your GP, yeah.",therapist
121,7,['N'],Uh.,client
121,8,['O'],"But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.",therapist
121,9,['N'],What's led me to come here?,client
121,10,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,11,['N'],My GP.,client
121,12,['OQ'],And what did he have to say?,therapist
121,13,['N'],"Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.",client
121,14,['O'],mm.,therapist
121,15,['S'],"And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.",client
121,16,['O'],Right.,therapist
121,17,['S'],"Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.",client
121,18,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,19,['S'],"But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.",client
121,20,['CR'],"Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?",therapist
121,21,['S'],"Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.",client
121,22,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,23,['S'],"But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.",client
121,24,['CR'],"So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.",therapist
121,25,['N'],Yeah.,client
121,26,['CR'],"You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""",therapist
121,27,['N'],"Mm, I'm very surprised.",client
121,28,['SR'],Mm. Came out of the blue for you?,therapist
121,29,['N'],Yes. I think it did.,client
121,30,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,31,['N'],Mm.,client
121,32,['CR'],And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-,therapist

121,43,['N'],My lifestyle—,client

121,46,['OQ'],-your lifestyle?,therapist
121,47,['S'],"No, not at all.",client
121,48,"['CR', 'OQ']",Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?,therapist
121,49,['S'],"Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-",client

121,51,['N'],"-you know, why you are-- Look around you.",client
121,52,['O'],"Mm, mm.",therapist
121,53,['N'],"um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?",client
121,54,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
121,55,['N'],Right?,client
121,56,['CR'],He's got a lot to do.,therapist

121,93,['N'],"-because, um, my mother mentioned-",client
121,94,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,95,['N'],"-that, uh, my father had diabetes-",client
121,96,['O'],Right.,therapist
121,97,['N'],"-diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-",client
121,98,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
121,99,['N'],"-uh, I haven't seen him for years.",client
121,100,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,101,['N'],But he might well have it because he is-,client
121,102,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,103,['N'],-a pretty cuddly guy. You know-,client
121,104,['O'],Right.,therapist
121,105,['N'],He's pretty big.,client
121,106,['SR'],So he fits the picture-,therapist
121,107,['N'],"Well, yes, the stereotype,-",client
121,108,['SR'],"-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.",therapist
121,109,['N'],"Yeah, I guess.",client
121,110,['CR'],"A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot",therapist
121,111,['N'],"Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-",client
121,112,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,113,['N'],-I don't know how many years.,client
121,114,['CR'],Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?,therapist
121,115,['C'],"Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.",client
121,116,['SR'],Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.,therapist
121,117,['N'],"Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?",client
121,118,['GI'],"That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.",therapist
121,119,['N'],"A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-",client
121,120,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,121,['N'],-if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?,client
121,122,['GI'],Correct. Yeah.,therapist
121,123,['N'],"Also, it's—",client
121,124,['GI'],But it's not inevitable.,therapist
121,125,['N'],Right. Okay.,client
121,126,['GI'],Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.,therapist
121,127,['N'],I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.,client
121,128,"['OQ', 'SR']","Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.",therapist
121,129,['N'],"To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.",client
121,130,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,131,['N'],"Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.",client
121,132,['O'],That makes a bit of sense.,therapist
121,133,['N'],"And why go any further, it's there?",client
121,134,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,135,['S'],Can't help it.,client
121,136,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,137,['N'],"They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.",client
121,138,['CR'],They managed with it.,therapist
121,139,['N'],Relatives relatively went into their 70s.,client
121,140,['O'],Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.,therapist
121,141,['N'],Well.,client
121,142,['O'],If that would help.,therapist
121,143,['N'],"If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.",client
121,144,['O'],"Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.",therapist
121,145,['N'],Okay.,client
121,146,"['CQ', 'GI']","And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.",therapist
121,147,['N'],I've heard of it yeah.,client
121,148,['GI'],"So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.",therapist
121,149,['N'],Right.,client
121,150,['GI'],"All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.",therapist
121,151,['N'],Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?,client
121,152,['GI'],"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.",therapist
121,153,['N'],"Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.",client
121,154,['O'],That's right.,therapist
121,155,['N'],So insulin you-you.,client
121,156,['O'],"Kind of, as your.",therapist
121,157,['N'],You have yourself draws bar.,client
121,158,['O'],Yap.,therapist
121,159,['N'],"Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.",client
121,160,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,161,['N'],Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?,client
121,162,['O'],That's a good way to think.,therapist
121,163,['N'],Is that what happened?,client
121,164,['GI'],Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.,therapist
121,165,['N'],Why?,client
121,166,['GI'],"And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.",therapist
121,167,['N'],Right. Okay.,client
121,168,"['GI', 'OQ', 'SR']","Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?",therapist
121,169,['N'],"You mean, personally?",client
121,170,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,171,['N'],"Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.",client
121,172,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,173,['N'],As you get older.,client
121,174,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,175,['N'],"I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.",client
121,176,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,177,['N'],"At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.",client
121,178,['SR'],A slightly more sedate lifestyle.,therapist
121,179,['N'],"Yeah, absolutely. You just do.",client
121,180,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,181,['N'],"You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.",client
121,182,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,183,['N'],"Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?",client
121,184,['O'],Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.,therapist
121,185,['N'],"Yeah, I mean.",client
121,186,"['OQ', 'SR']","What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.",therapist
121,187,['N'],"Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.",client
121,188,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,189,['N'],"Um, I haven't noticed.",client
121,190,['O'],Mh-hmm.,therapist
121,191,['C'],"I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.",client
121,192,['O'],Okay.,therapist
121,193,['C'],"If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.",client
121,194,['CR'],So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.,therapist
121,195,['C'],"Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.",client
121,196,['O'],"Yeah, Mh-hmm.",therapist
121,197,['C'],"Um, more than I would normally.",client
121,198,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,199,['N'],"But that would be, that would be about it.",client
121,200,['O'],Mh-hmm.,therapist
121,201,['S'],"Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.",client
121,202,['SR'],"You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.",therapist
121,203,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.",client
121,204,['O'],Mh-hmm.,therapist
121,205,['N'],"Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.",client
121,206,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,207,['N'],Um.,client
121,208,['O'],Okay.,therapist
121,209,['N'],But maybe I-maybe I don't know.,client
121,210,['SR'],"Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.",therapist
121,211,['N'],"I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.",client
121,212,['CR'],Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.,therapist
121,213,['N'],"Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.",client
121,214,['SR'],"From your perspective, things are going well?",therapist
121,215,['S'],"My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.",client
121,216,['SR'],Yeah. It doesn't fit.,therapist
121,217,['N'],"And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?",client
121,218,['O'],Mh-hmm.,therapist
121,219,['N'],And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.,client
121,220,['O'],Right.,therapist
121,221,['N'],"Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.",client
121,222,['SR'],"Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.",therapist
121,223,['N'],"For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.",client
121,224,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,225,['N'],Um.,client
121,226,['SR'],So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--,therapist
121,227,['N'],"Come on, you know.",client
121,228,['O'],And you know that's a bit too-,therapist
121,229,['S'],"Well, life is too short.",client
121,230,['SR'],Too much.,therapist
121,231,['N'],You know it's the truth.,client
121,232,['O'],Yeah. Okay.,therapist
121,233,['N'],I mean you know—,client
121,234,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?",therapist
121,235,['N'],"Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.",client
121,236,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,237,['N'],"And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.",client
121,238,['O'],Okay.,therapist
121,239,['N'],And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.,client
121,240,['O'],Mh-hmm.,therapist
121,241,['N'],"Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.",client
121,242,['SR'],"So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.",therapist
121,243,['N'],"Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.",client
121,244,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,245,['N'],"Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.",client
121,246,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
121,247,['N'],"And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.",client
121,248,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,249,['N'],"You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""",client
121,250,['O'],"Hmm. Yeah, yeah.",therapist
121,251,['C'],"And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.",client
121,252,['SR'],Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?,therapist
121,253,['N'],"Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,",client
121,254,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,255,['N'],"I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.",client
121,256,['CR'],"And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.",therapist
121,257,['N'],"Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.",client
121,258,['CR'],Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.,therapist
121,259,['N'],Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.,client
121,260,['O'],Okay.,therapist
121,261,['N'],Maybe I'm just—,client
121,262,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,263,['S'],"You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.",client
121,264,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,265,['N'],"And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient",client
121,266,['SR'],Yeah.,therapist
121,267,['N'],-or Kentucky Fried or whatever.,client
121,268,['CR'],"Very appealing, isn't it?",therapist
121,269,['S'],"You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.",client
121,270,['O'],"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.",therapist
121,271,['N'],So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.,client
121,272,['CR'],"Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?",therapist
121,273,['N'],"Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.",client
121,274,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,275,['N'],-for ages.,client
121,276,['CR'],They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.,therapist
121,277,['N'],"Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.",client
121,278,['SR'],So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-,therapist
121,279,['N'],Well—,client
121,280,['OQ'],-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?,therapist
121,281,['C'],"Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.",client
121,282,['O'],Right.,therapist
121,283,['C'],"I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—",client
121,284,['SR'],You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--,therapist
121,285,['S'],"Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is",client
121,286,['SR'],You still run and have a cigarette?,therapist
121,287,['S'],"You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—",client
121,288,['SR'],"Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.",therapist
121,289,['N'],"Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.",client
121,290,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,291,['N'],That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.,client
121,292,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,293,['N'],That was rugby and cricket was the same really.,client
121,294,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,295,['N'],"Um, but now—",client
121,296,['CR'],"But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?",therapist
121,297,['C'],"Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""",client
121,298,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,299,['S'],But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.,client
121,300,['SR'],"Okay, so you meant to reduce.",therapist
121,301,['N'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
121,302,['CR'],You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.,therapist
121,303,['C'],Yeah.,client
121,304,['SR'],"When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.",therapist
121,305,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. I sort of—",client
121,306,['SR'],So you've made our decision to do that?,therapist
121,307,['S'],"it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.",client

121,309,['S'],"It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—",client
121,310,"['CQ', 'CR']","Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?",therapist
121,311,['N'],"Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-",client
121,312,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,313,['N'],"You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.",client
121,314,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,315,['C'],"So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]",client
121,316,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,317,['S'],"Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.",client
121,318,"['CQ', 'CR']",But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?,therapist
121,319,['S'],"Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.",client
121,320,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,321,['C'],So we cut that down as I say.,client
121,322,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,323,['S'],"But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.",client
121,324,['SR'],"You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.",therapist
121,325,['N'],"No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-",client

121,329,['C'],"So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent",client
121,330,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
121,331,['N'],"-and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.",client
121,332,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,333,['N'],"Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-",client
121,334,['SR'],So everything else looked pretty good?,therapist
121,335,['C'],"My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.",client
121,336,['SR'],"Cholesterol good, your weight is good.",therapist

121,338,['SR'],"Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.",therapist
121,339,['C'],"Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.",client
121,340,['CR'],"And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.",therapist
121,341,['N'],Absolutely.,client
121,342,['SR'],So we're looking good.,therapist
121,343,['N'],And then we come to this-,client

121,345,['N'],"-too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.",client
121,346,['SR'],"Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.",therapist
121,347,['N'],"So, yeah.",client
121,348,['CR'],And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.,therapist
121,349,['N'],No.,client
121,350,['SR'],"Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.",therapist
121,351,['S'],"I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.",client
121,352,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,353,['N'],You shouldn't smoke.,client
121,354,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,355,['S'],"And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""",client
121,356,['CR'],"So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-",therapist

121,358,['O'],Mm-hm.,therapist
121,359,['S'],"And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.",client
121,360,['CR'],A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.,therapist
121,361,['S'],"Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.",client
121,362,['SR'],"Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.",therapist
121,363,['S'],"No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.",client
121,364,['SR'],Feel like you need to. Yeah.,therapist

121,366,['O'],Mm.,therapist
121,367,['N'],"Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.",client

121,369,['C'],"So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-",client
121,370,['SR'],"I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.",therapist
121,371,['C'],Is smoking related to diabetes then?,client
121,372,['GI'],"It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.",therapist
121,373,['N'],Oh.,client
121,374,['GI'],So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-,therapist
121,375,['C'],Don't help.,client
121,376,['GI'],-isn't a good combination.,therapist

121,378,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?",therapist
121,379,['C'],"Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.",client
121,380,['NEGO'],"Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.",therapist
121,381,['C'],I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.,client
121,382,['GI'],"Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-",therapist
121,383,['C'],Something of a rollover effect.,client

121,385,['C'],"Domino effect, yeah.",client
121,386,['SR'],"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-",therapist
121,387,['C'],"I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?",client
121,388,['GI'],"Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.",therapist
121,389,['N'],Right.,client
121,390,['SR'],"You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.",therapist
121,391,['N'],Yeah.,client
121,392,['SR'],"So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.",therapist
121,393,['N'],"Okay, so—",client
121,394,['SR'],"So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.",therapist
121,395,['C'],"So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?",client
121,396,['O'],I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.,therapist

121,399,['C'],"You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—",client
121,400,['SR'],"So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.",therapist
121,401,['N'],Maybe.,client
121,402,['SR'],"Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.",therapist
121,403,['C'],Yeah.,client
121,404,['SR'],"And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.",therapist
121,405,['N'],Yeah.,client
121,406,['OQ'],"Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?",therapist
121,407,['S'],"Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.",client
121,408,['O'],No.,therapist
121,409,['C'],"So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.",client
121,410,['SR'],Yeah? You like the social aspect?,therapist
121,411,['C'],"I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-",client

121,413,['S'],"-till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—",client
121,414,['CR'],"So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?",therapist
121,415,['C'],"So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—",client
121,416,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,417,['C'],"You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?",client
121,418,['O'],Haven't quite that-,therapist
121,419,['N'],And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—,client
121,420,['CR'],And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?,therapist
121,421,['N'],And that gets me going. Yeah.,client
121,422,['SR'],And the sugar in it helps too.,therapist
121,423,['S'],"Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.",client
121,424,['SR'],"So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.",therapist
121,425,['N'],"Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?",client
121,426,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,427,['C'],"if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.",client
121,428,['GI'],And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.,therapist
121,429,['N'],Yeah.,client
121,430,['SR'],And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.,therapist
121,431,['N'],"Yeah, and then—",client
121,432,['CR'],You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.,therapist
121,433,['C'],"And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""",client
121,434,['CR'],That sounds like a great plan.,therapist
121,435,['N'],"And so maybe that would, uh—",client
121,436,['O'],"Yeah, sounds like a good idea.",therapist
121,437,['C'],Maybe it's an idea. I mean—,client
121,438,['CR'],"I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.",therapist
121,439,['C'],"Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.",client
121,440,['OQ'],"Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?",therapist
121,441,['C'],"Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.",client
121,442,['OQ'],What's to lose? What's to gain?,therapist
121,443,['C'],"Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?",client
121,444,['O'],"It does make sense, yeah.",therapist
121,445,['C'],"Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—",client
121,446,['SR'],"So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.",therapist

121,448,['O'],Right.,therapist

121,552,['SR'],And you also mentioned you'll perhaps go and- back and see the doctor and just give him a bit of an update as to-,therapist
121,553,['S'],"No, [crosstalk] oh, well, okay, yeah I didn't- yeah, I'll go back and say-- Well, look, I'd-I'd rather not go back to the doctor and say, ""I'm gonna do this, this, this-",client
121,554,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,555,['N'],-this and this.,client
121,556,['O'],Mhm.,therapist
121,557,['C'],This is between you and me.,client
121,558,['O'],Yep.,therapist
121,559,['C'],All right?,client
121,560,['O'],It's fine.,therapist
121,561,['C'],"But this is what I'm gonna do. All right? And like I said, I'm gonna make the inquiries, I will start there-",client
121,562,['O'],Sure.,therapist
121,563,['C'],"-I will give up, uh, I'll give up the V drinks,-",client
121,564,['O'],Mhm.,therapist
121,565,['C'],"-I think, um, look for some better wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I'd take an interest really.",client
121,566,['SR'],You are gonna make a start?,therapist
121,567,['C'],"I'll take an interest really and-and, uh, but it is quite exciting, Mark.",client
121,568,['O'],"It is. Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session.",therapist
121,569,['N'],Yeah.,client
121,570,['GI'],"-before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some information that might help-help you.",therapist
121,571,['S'],Not too much.,client
121,572,"['GI', 'SR']","Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a little bit of background information on-",therapist
121,573,['C'],"Yeah, yeah.",client
121,574,['O'],-some of the things that have-,therapist
121,575,['C'],"Just give me a bit of background, really.",client
121,576,['O'],"-around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-",therapist
121,577,['C'],"Oh, yeah, and what it is-",client
121,578,['O'],[unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.,therapist
121,579,['C'],"-because I don't really know. Yeah, yeah.",client
121,580,['NEGO'],"Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-",therapist
121,581,['N'],Okay.,client
121,582,['SR'],-see what sort of little changes you've managed to make. I'd be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-,therapist
121,583,['C'],"Wha-what are we talking about, sort of few months down the line?",client
121,584,['ADVI'],It's really up to you. Probably a little bit sooner would be good.,therapist
121,585,['N'],"What, in about a month's time?",client
121,586,['O'],That'd be great.,therapist
121,587,['C'],"Yeah, okay, I'm up for that.",client
121,588,['OQ'],How does that sound?,therapist
121,589,['C'],"I'm up for that. Yeah, now-now that's putting me, um, that's very gently putting my head on the block",client
121,590,"['CQ', 'SR']",Because you don't know the timeline?,therapist
121,591,['C'],"-and I don't mind that because, um, yeah, that's cool.",client
121,592,['O'],Mhm.,therapist
121,593,['C'],"Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in a month.",client
121,594,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
121,595,['C'],No worries.,client
121,596,['O'],"Excellent, excellent. Thanks, Mike. [croostalk]",therapist
121,597,['C'],And I appreciate it. Thank you.,client
122,0,['S'],"Well, I'm here because my mom wants me to be here.",client
122,1,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
122,2,['S'],"I don't really wanna be here, but it-it-- whatever.",client
122,3,['O'],Got it.,therapist
122,4,['N'],"Um, she-she found my stash-",client
122,5,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
122,6,['N'],"-and she freaked out, and she's going crazy over it. Um, I don't why she was going through stuff in the first place, but whatever, so, now I'm here.",client
122,7,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
122,8,['S'],"Um, I've been hanging out with a new cool crowd of people that I really like.",client
122,9,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
122,10,['N'],"Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it.",client
122,11,['CR'],"Yeah. So-so you've got this new group of friends and-and, um, you-you actually kind of like where you're at with things right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a, you know, all of this.",therapist
122,12,['N'],Yeah.,client
122,13,['SR'],Yeah.,therapist
122,14,['N'],"Yeah, basically.",client
122,15,['SR'],Yeah.,therapist
122,16,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
122,17,"['CQ', 'CR']","And, uh, sounds like you're-you're pretty upset with your mom for-for doing that?",therapist
122,18,['N'],I am.,client
122,19,['SR'],Yeah.,therapist
122,20,['S'],"I mean, it's my stuff, I don't know why she's—",client
122,21,['CR'],"Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff.",therapist
122,22,['N'],I-I don't go- I don't go through her s- I don't go through her stuff. I don't go through her purse. I don't—,client
122,23,"['CQ', 'CR']",Yeah. So why should she go through yours?,therapist
122,24,['N'],Right.,client
122,25,['O'],Yeah. Yeah,therapist
124,0,['OQ'],"Okay. So what ideas do you have, Natalie for, um, getting started in adding more physical activity?",therapist
124,1,['C'],"Well, I think, um, like when I was really active in the past, I enjoy going to the gym and I like that regardless of what's happening with the weather outside, that-that's always an option. Um, so I've kind of already started to look and see, like, how much gym memberships cost in the area. Um, I really like one that's like month to month and doesn't require me to pay out for like a year because, in the summertime, I just don't use that when the weather is nice, I like to be outside.",client
124,2,['C'],"So, um, I do think that that would be an option. Um, I did enjoy doing yoga in the past. I, um, I don't care for swimming, uh, because it requires a lot of extra prep time, and like, I don't- chlorine in my hair just doesn't really go very well usually. Um, but I really like walking, um, weightlifting, running is okay. Um, that was more at my, like, peak activity level, so I don't think I could start out running now, but I'd like to work up to it.",client
124,3,['SR'],Great. It sounds like there are a lot of activities that you do like-,therapist
124,4,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
124,5,['SR'],"-and I'm hearing a theme of climate control, [chuckles] being important to you and you've already been researching gyms.",therapist
124,6,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
124,7,['OQ'],Tell me more about that.,therapist
124,8,['S'],"Yeah. So I just- on my phone, if I'm like in the grocery store, I'm kind of just looking through, and on Google, I'll type in like ""Gyms in the area"" and I'll look and see what's there. And, um, I don't ever want to sign up to learn more 'cause I feel like then they just keep emailing you forever. So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me. Just like I mentioned, I don't want to be paying for six months or a year out.",client
124,9,['SR'],Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced-,therapist
124,10,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
124,11,['SR'],-and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website.,therapist
124,12,['N'],Yeah.,client
124,13,['SR'],And I completely agree [laughs]about wanting to avoid the sales pitch-,therapist
124,14,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
124,15,"['OQ', 'SR']","-um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step?",therapist
124,16,['C'],"Yeah, I think, um, you know, I've kind of looked around and seen what I- what's available to me. Um, I think the next step would be to maybe go visit one place and just see, like, what equipment they have. Um, I also think too, I'd like to be outside when the weather permits. I like to walk. I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable. So if there is, uh, decent weather, I think going outside and, you know, getting some steps in or just walking would be a good first start for me.",client
124,17,['SR'],Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting.,therapist
124,18,['C'],Right. Yeah.,client
124,19,['CQ'],"I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that?",therapist
124,20,['N'],Sure. Yeah.,client
124,21,"['CQ', 'GI']","I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms. Uh, is that one that you have an interest in or have looked at already?",therapist
124,22,['N'],I don't know that I've looked closely at that. I don't know much about their pricing or anything like that.,client
124,23,['O'],"Yes. And honestly, I don't either. [chuckles] I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms.",therapist
124,24,['N'],I agree.,client
124,25,['SR'],So something to look into if you're interested.,therapist
124,26,['C'],"Yeah, definitely.",client
124,27,['GI'],And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first-,therapist
124,28,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
124,29,['SR'],-and to build some confidence in that conversation.,therapist
124,30,['C'],"Yeah, no, yeah. That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out.",client
124,31,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather-",therapist
124,32,['C'],Mm-hmm.,client
124,33,['SR'],-or the perfect gym?,therapist
124,34,['C'],"Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all.",client
124,35,"['CQ', 'OPTI', 'SR']",Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all?,therapist
124,36,['C'],"Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it.",client
124,37,"['OPTI', 'SR']","That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs-",therapist
124,38,['C'],Mm-hmm.,client
124,39,"['OPTI', 'OQ', 'SR']","-and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound?",therapist
124,40,['C'],"No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting.",client
124,41,['SR'],Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started.,therapist
124,42,['C'],"Yeah, I think so.",client
124,43,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals?",therapist
124,44,['C'],I think I'm at a 10.,client
124,45,['O'],Okay.,therapist
124,46,['C'],"Yeah. I think that, like I said, I think I'll find ways to walk. Um, and I'm at a point now where I've done as much research, I've found out as much information, I think, as I can on the gyms that are local here. Um, but I will check out the- the Y to see if it maybe is a bit cheaper and also a bit more, like, welcoming and doesn't require a- like, a six-month contract or anything like that. So I feel like those would both be good starts. Yeah.",client
124,47,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through?,therapist
124,48,['C'],"Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like-",client
124,49,['SR'],"Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside.",therapist
124,50,['C'],"Yeah, but hopefully there's one. So, yeah.",client
124,51,"['CR', 'OQ']","Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general. And, uh, today we've talked about a small-small step to get started and you're hoping to experience some mood boost and some energy as you get rolling here. Um, how are you feeling about today's session?",therapist
124,52,['C'],"No, I feel really good. I think even coming in, I didn't have a like step-by-step idea of what I wanted to do next, but no, this has been helpful to know what those small steps are, and like you said, hopefully, I do start feeling better. Yeah.",client
124,53,['O'],"Great. Well, I look forward to checking in with you, and thanks so much for coming in.",therapist
124,54,['N'],Thanks for having me. All right.,client
125,0,['N'],The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted.,client
125,1,['SR'],"So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?",therapist
125,2,['N'],"Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.",client
125,3,"['CQ', 'CR']","So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?",therapist
125,4,['N'],"Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.",client
125,5,"['CQ', 'SR']","Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?",therapist
125,6,['N'],"Well, what is normal for a baby this age?",client
127,0,['SR'],"So, where you said you'd like to start, Sal, is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other.",therapist
127,1,['N'],"Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, my asthma has just been out of control lately and my doctor says that might be connected to Oscar.",client
127,2,['OQ'],"Hmm. So, what- can you let me know or-or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?",therapist
127,3,['N'],"Um, I've got allergy testing. It's just, uh, the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing-",client
127,4,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
127,5,['C'],"-that's cut down. Um, and then they said the drinking might contribute to it, too. So, I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know.",client
127,6,['O'],Hmm.,therapist
127,7,['N'],"The drinking, the smoking and the dust that I got, the, um, the scratch test for.",client
127,8,['O'],Right.,therapist
127,9,['N'],"And-and-and that's what I know, and that I take the medicine for it.",client
127,10,['CQ'],Okay. And that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern?,therapist
127,11,['N'],"No, I've had it for-for 12 years and now it's a concern. I don't understand.",client
127,12,['SR'],Hmm. Yeah. And I-I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes. You've almost quit smoking.,therapist
127,13,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,14,['SR'],You're just down to your last couple of cigarettes-,therapist
127,15,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,16,['SR'],-and you're not even smoking those in the house.,therapist
127,17,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,18,['SR'],"So, your house is totally smoke-free.",therapist
127,19,['N'],"Yes, just that work with the [unintelligible 00:01:24].",client
127,20,['SR'],"Yeah, okay. And you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol.",therapist
127,21,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,22,['SR'],-and-and I think you mentioned done-done a little bit towards that.,therapist
127,23,['C'],"Mm-hmm. I'm a little I'm a couple of down. I used to drink four at night, now I'm down to three at least.",client
127,24,['O'],"Okay, okay.",therapist
127,25,['N'],Uh-huh.,client
127,26,['SR'],"So now almost like that's not good enough, like now you have to, now it's the dog and now-",therapist
127,27,['N'],"Mm-hmm, what's next, yeah, yeah.",client
127,28,['GI'],"-what's next. Right. Okay. So, I mean, there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse.",therapist
127,29,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,30,['OQ'],"-but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar, you know, when he's in the house or-or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him, what happens with your asthma symptoms?",therapist
127,31,['S'],"Well, we keep them clean, like he's cleaned. So, all the dander doesn't really make sense, but I have been noticing that sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside, I wheeze a little bit, but I think it has to do with, um, the hair, the, in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking.",client
127,32,['O'],Okay.,therapist
127,33,['N'],"So, I don't know if it's that-that's where I'm confused. I don't know how this could be happening.",client
127,34,['CR'],"Hmm. So, it doesn't make total sense to you that-that it's all Oscar's fault and that-",therapist
127,35,['N'],"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.",client
127,36,['O'],That's that the only solution.,therapist
127,37,['N'],But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.,client
127,38,['CR'],"I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-",therapist
127,39,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,40,['CR'],-such a big part of your life for so long.,therapist
127,41,['S'],"Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. I just want some medicine and I want to keep Oscar and I wanna feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life and it honestly feels like my-my nose is just above the water.",client
127,42,['O'],"Hmm. Yeah. And-and in the end, you know, whatever you- whatever you do, about Oscar, about your asthma, about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda-setting worksheet, I mean, you are in the driver's seat solid. It really is your choice.",therapist
127,43,['N'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, that feels good. That I, you know, at least it is my choice. I just feel like just about, I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up. Um, and I'm kind of sad about things.",client
127,44,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
127,45,['N'],"And I don't know, I don't know what to do.",client
127,46,['CR'],"There's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife, with the new baby.",therapist
127,47,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,48,['CR'],"And now thinking about, looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby.",therapist
127,49,['N'],"Mm-hmm. I want- I want John Carlos to grow up with Oscar. So he has his friend when he's young, too. And, um, I just, it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you-you gotta think about then, um, I'm not feeling good about it.",client
127,50,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm, so what-what would need to happen or how would you know, when you- when or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not?",therapist
127,51,['N'],"Man, uh, how would I know? I don't know. I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine- she gave me the strongest medicine and it wasn't working.",client
127,52,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
127,53,['S'],"That would be the way right now 'cause I can't see, I don't know how I'm going to give this dog up.",client
127,54,['CR'],Yeah and I get the feeling that it's something that you wanna think about that this is a really big decision-,therapist
127,55,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
127,56,['SR'],-and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry.,therapist
127,57,['N'],"No, no. It's something I got to just sit there and-and kind of, um, put the pros and the cons on the table about, but-",client
127,58,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
127,59,['N'],-something's going on.,client
128,0,['N'],"Wow, I can't believe he stopped crying finally and fell asleep. Poor guy.",client
128,1,['OQ'],"Yeah. He wasn't too happy with the exam, was he Hailey?",therapist
128,2,['N'],No he wasn't.,client
128,3,['OQ'],"Um, well the good news is that the exam's over and I don't think Jake has pneumonia. What I actually think he has is a cold. So there are some things you could do to manage his symptoms. Would you be interested in knowing?",therapist
128,4,['N'],"Yeah, absolutely.",client
128,5,['ADVI'],"What I would recommend is that you avoid over-the-counter cold remedies, keep him away from any friends or family who may have the flu, keep him well hydrated, um, avoid excessive dust, and avoid smoking. And at least that last one's easy because you are an ex-smoker now.",therapist
128,6,['N'],"Well, you're right actually, I-I did quit smoking but just last week my mom took Jake for the first time. It was a Friday night, so friends were going out to celebrate a birthday.",client
128,7,['O'],"Oh, fun.",therapist
128,8,['N'],"Yeah. At one point in the night, though, they all went out to have a cigarette and I joined them. Since then, I've been having a couple of cigarettes at night, but never near Jake and never near his clothes or his toys. I mean, I've heard about second-hand smoking. And I-I don't want to be- expose him to it, so I've been avoiding him when I smoke.",client
128,9,['OQ'],"All right, Well, first I'd just like to commend you for your honesty and that's really helpful information that you shared with me. Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?",therapist
128,10,['N'],"Yeah, sure.",client
128,11,"['ADVI', 'SR']","So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-",therapist
128,12,['N'],Yeah.,client
128,13,['OQ'],-correct?,therapist
128,14,['N'],Exactly.,client
128,15,['ADVI'],"So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold.",therapist
128,16,['S'],"Yeah, well, you know that sounds okay. While he's sick, I might be able to smoke outside in the next couple days or so, but the thing is, usually I'm craving a cigarette the most when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. I put Jake to bed, I open up a bottle and I pour myself a glass and I'm finally able to unwind, so, I get a craving for a cigarette, so, I'm not sure long-term I'd be able to smoke outside.",client
128,17,['SR'],"Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic.",therapist
128,18,['N'],"Yeah, exactly and another thing is that sometimes in the morning, after I've had a couple of glasses of wine, I kinda feel tired or groggy or low on energy, so, even that I'm not sure is completely relaxing. Especially if I've had a cigarette the night before, I always feel so bad.",client
128,19,['SR'],"So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great.",therapist
128,20,['N'],Exactly.,client
128,21,['OQ'],Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?,therapist
128,22,['N'],Sure. I've never heard of them.,client
128,23,"['GI', 'OQ']","Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?",therapist
128,24,['N'],"Well, usually I'm having more than two glasses but if you're saying that's gonna minimize some risk and I guess some of the grogginess I'm feeling the next morning, then maybe I should just try and have one glass of wine in the evenings?",client
128,25,['SR'],"So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing.",therapist
128,26,['C'],"Yeah, I-I'd absolutely maybe reduce. I'll try my best to reduce, but I'm not sure about the smoking.",client
128,27,['OQ'],"Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?",therapist
128,28,['C'],Yeah. I think that sounds okay.,client
128,29,['OQ'],"That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful?",therapist
128,30,['C'],"No. I think just talking about it was helpful, you know, and I'm- I'm glad you've given me some information. Maybe just this week I can think about it a little more, you know, I-I feel pretty overwhelmed right now. There's so much to do. My days are pretty full, so, maybe I can just s-sit on it for a week.",client
128,31,"['GI', 'OQ']","Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment.",therapist
128,32,['C'],"All right. That sounds good. Thanks, Dr.",client
128,33,['O'],"Thanks, Hailey. We'll see you next week.",therapist
129,0,['N'],"Dr. Morrow, I'm so relieved I'm not pregnant.",client
129,1,['CR'],"Huh, you feel like you dodged the bullet.",therapist
129,2,['N'],I really feel like I dodged the bullet. That was- that was probably the scariest like two days of my life.,client
129,3,"['CQ', 'CR']",It feels like it was like two days was a year?,therapist
129,4,['N'],Yup.,client
129,5,['O'],Ah.,therapist
129,6,['N'],"Yeah, it went so slow.",client
129,7,['O'],Okay.,therapist
129,8,['N'],Even just being here today is like minutes ticking by.,client
129,9,['O'],Okay.,therapist
129,10,['N'],It's really good news.,client
129,11,['OQ'],So what would have happened if you found out that you were pregnant?,therapist
129,12,['N'],I don't even know. I'm-I'm not ready to have a kid. I know that. I know my life is not ready for that step.,client
129,13,['CR'],Okay. That's a big step and that's not the direction you want to go in right now.,therapist
129,14,['N'],"Yeah, no.",client
129,15,['CQ'],Would you be open to kind of exploring the idea of birth control and family planning?,therapist
129,16,['S'],"Um, I don't really want to go there. I just-- that sort of stuff just weirds me out. Yeah, I take something fun and just makes it really medical.",client
129,17,['CR'],"Now, it's a discussion you don't really wanna have.",therapist
129,18,['S'],No.,client
129,19,['CR'],"At the same time, you have some concerns about the possibility of getting pregnant.",therapist
129,20,['S'],"Yeah, I mean I'm-I'm careful. I do what I can, but I don't wanna take anything for that.",client
129,21,['CR'],"So you found some ways to prevent pregnancy up until-- well, maybe, um, you've been pretty fortunate, and then there is also some times where you feel like, ""Oh, no. What if I didn't dodge the bullet?""",therapist
129,22,['N'],"Yeah. It's-it's scary. I mean, this is the first time I've ever had that sort of feeling of ""What am I gonna do?""",client
129,23,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
129,24,['N'],"And-and that fear was like-- yeah. Up until now, I've been good, yeah.",client
129,25,['CR'],"Okay. So, you've been able to kind of avoid any kind of consequences, and right now, you're not feeling that talking about birth control is something on your-your list.",therapist
129,26,['S'],"Yeah. No, it- it's just- it's just weird for me. I don't- I don't like thinking about that stuff, yeah.",client
129,27,['GI'],"Sure. I totally appreciate that, and it's your decision, Olivia. You know yourself best and what fits for you. If you ever feel like you like to open up the idea of conversation about family planning or birth control, I'd love to talk to you about that another time.",therapist
129,28,['S'],"Yeah, maybe another time. Just, I'm not ready for it.",client
129,29,['O'],Okay.,therapist
129,30,['S'],I'm not ready for that conversation right now.,client
129,31,['O'],Okay. I respect that. Thanks though for coming in to see me today.,therapist
129,32,['N'],Yeah.,client
129,33,['O'],And I'm glad that this appointment was a positive one for you.,therapist
129,34,['N'],Thank you.,client
129,35,['O'],You're welcome.,therapist
132,0,"['CQ', 'NEGO', 'SR']","Hello, again, Mr. Green. It's really nice to see you again. If you remember last week, we looked at your results here and you've got impaired glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type two diabetes, your blood pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit too. So today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the things that you could do for yourself that might improve the situation. And as you know, there's all sorts of things can affect your health. So can we just have a bit of a general chat, but how are you getting on?",therapist
132,1,['S'],"Well, I suppose you're gonna give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I've got to change my ways and give up the things I enjoy.",client
132,2,['NEGO'],"Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health.",therapist
132,3,['N'],The doc said I've got to take pills for the rest of my life.,client
132,4,['CR'],You don't seem too happy about that.,therapist
132,5,['N'],"Well, I feel fine, but the-the doc said it could save my life.",client
132,6,['NEGO'],"Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go.",therapist
132,7,['C'],"Okay, what should I do first?",client
132,8,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?",therapist
132,9,['C'],Where do you think I should start?,client
132,10,['NEGO'],"Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say.",therapist
132,11,['N'],"Yeah, uh, you tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn’t you?",client
132,12,"['NEGO', 'OQ', 'SR']","Absolutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,",therapist
132,13,['S'],"Uh, I loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy.",client
132,14,['CR'],"It’s really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?",therapist
132,15,['N'],"I really should do. Or shouldn't I,",client
132,16,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",How important is it for you then to lose weight?,therapist
132,17,['C'],"Well, I'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren growing up and I should,suppose I should be an example to them.",client
132,18,"['CQ', 'SR']",So can it be in there for your-your family's important to you?,therapist
132,19,['C'],"Yes. I want to be there for them, but not a burden to them.",client
132,20,['OQ'],Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?,therapist
132,21,['C'],"Uh, I've been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So have to do what I need to, to improve my health.",client
132,22,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",What's kind of the first thing you might think about doing?,therapist
132,23,['C'],"You know, to start with, I could cut down on my drinking. Um, that's adding to my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?",client
132,24,['SR'],"Yeah. That would be a really good place to start, mm-hmm.",therapist
132,25,['C'],"In fact, I think I'll try and cut out the booze altogether. My wife says I drink too much at the weekends.",client
132,26,['CR'],So I think it should be really supportive of that then.,therapist
132,27,['C'],And I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at works.,client
132,28,['OQ'],So what would you do to make sure you didn't get hungry at work?,therapist
132,29,['C'],I'm gonna start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.,client
132,30,"['CR', 'NEGO', 'OQ']","Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?",therapist
132,31,['C'],"Well, there's one, one thing uh, I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my food. The doc said that would help with my blood pressure.",client
132,32,"['CR', 'GI']","Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too.",therapist
132,33,['C'],"Well, I didn't know that. Um, it's good to know. I'll tell my wife, um, she's still very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis.",client
132,34,"['CR', 'OQ']","So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?",therapist
132,35,['C'],"I feel if I go ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day when we look at it, the figures might be a lot better.",client
132,36,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",That's great. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?,therapist
132,37,['N'],"Yes, that’s fine with me.",client
132,38,['O'],That’s great. All the very best then.,therapist
132,39,['N'],Thanks. You too.,client
133,0,['CQ'],"Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.",therapist
133,1,['N'],Mm.,client
133,2,['OQ'],"Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.",therapist
133,3,['N'],"Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—",client
133,4,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—",therapist
133,5,['S'],I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.,client
133,6,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
133,7,['S'],"I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.",client
133,8,['SR'],Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.,therapist
133,9,['N'],Mm.,client
133,10,"['OQ', 'SR']","And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—",therapist
133,11,['S'],"Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.",client
133,12,['O'],Okay.,therapist
133,13,['S'],"I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.",client
133,14,['SR'],Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-,therapist
133,15,['S'],Yes.,client
133,16,['CQ'],-the expectation of life on the inside something?,therapist
133,17,['S'],"Yeah, it's worse.",client
133,18,['CQ'],Yeah?,therapist
133,19,['S'],Yeah.,client
133,20,['OQ'],So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—,therapist
133,21,['C'],"I haven't yet, I mean-",client
133,22,['O'],Okay.,therapist
133,23,['S'],"-the, uh, the offer's there.",client
133,24,['O'],Yeah?,therapist
133,25,['C'],"Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-",client
133,26,['OQ'],"Uh, tell me-",therapist
133,27,['S'],-it's there.,client
133,28,['CQ'],It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?,therapist
133,29,['S'],Yeah.,client
133,30,['CR'],"You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.",therapist
133,31,['S'],No.,client
133,32,['OQ'],So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?,therapist
133,33,['N'],How long have I been out?,client
133,34,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
133,35,['C'],"Three weeks, one day.",client
133,36,['CQ'],"Three weeks, isn't it?",therapist
133,37,['C'],"Three weeks, one day.",client
133,38,['OQ'],So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?,therapist
133,39,['N'],I don't know.,client
133,40,['SR'],22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.,therapist
133,41,['C'],"Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.",client
133,42,['O'],Okay.,therapist
133,43,['C'],And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.,client
133,44,['CR'],"Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?",therapist
133,45,['C'],"No, never lasts.",client
133,46,['CR'],Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.,therapist
133,47,['N'],Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.,client
133,48,['SR'],Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.,therapist
133,49,['C'],Yeah. And- [crosstalk],client
133,50,['SR'],Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-,therapist
133,51,['N'],"-sort of opposite, yeah.",client
133,52,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
133,53,['N'],"You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.",client
133,54,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
133,55,['N'],"But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.",client
133,56,['O'],Okay. Okay. So—,therapist
133,57,['N'],Do you have an idea?,client
133,58,['O'],"No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.",therapist
133,59,['N'],Mm.,client
133,60,"['OQ', 'SR']","But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?",therapist
133,61,['C'],Fiona?,client
133,62,['CQ'],Yeah?,therapist
133,63,['C'],Yeah.,client
133,64,['OQ'],Tell me about Fiona?,therapist
133,65,['C'],"She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-",client
133,66,['O'],Okay.,therapist
133,67,['C'],-something.,client
133,68,['CQ'],Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?,therapist
133,69,['N'],12 years.,client
133,70,['SR'],"12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?",therapist
133,71,['C'],Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.,client
133,72,['SR'],Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.,therapist
133,73,['C'],"It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.",client
133,74,['O'],"Yeah, yeah.",therapist
133,75,['C'],"Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.",client
133,76,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
133,77,['C'],"I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.",client
133,78,['CQ'],"Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?",therapist
133,79,['N'],Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.,client
133,80,['OQ'],Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?,therapist
133,81,['C'],"She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.",client
133,82,['OQ'],"She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?",therapist
133,83,['C'],"The one that, you know—",client
133,84,['CQ'],Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?,therapist
133,85,['C'],"Yeah, that's the one.",client
133,86,['CQ'],Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?,therapist
133,87,['C'],"No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.",client
133,88,['O'],Okay.,therapist
133,89,['C'],Yeah.,client
133,90,['OQ'],So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?,therapist
133,91,['N'],"If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.",client
133,92,['O'],"Sure, yeah.",therapist
133,93,['N'],"And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.",client
133,94,['OQ'],"All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?",therapist
133,95,['C'],"I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?",client
133,96,['O'],I know.,therapist
133,97,['N'],"Like if I'm not careful, I will be.",client
133,98,['SR'],"Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.",therapist
133,99,['N'],"Yeah, certainly.",client
133,100,['CR'],"Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?",therapist
133,101,['C'],Yeah.,client
133,102,['O'],Yeah?,therapist
133,103,['C'],Yeah.,client
133,104,['CQ'],Yeah. And you're still with her?,therapist
133,105,['C'],"Yeah, yep.",client
133,106,"['OQ', 'SR']","Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.",therapist
133,107,['C'],"You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.",client
133,108,['CR'],"Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?",therapist
133,109,['N'],"A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.",client
133,110,['SR'],Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—,therapist

So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go.

133,146,['GI'],"No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-",therapist

133,212,['OQ'],"And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?",therapist
133,213,['S'],"Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.",client

133,222,['O'],"Okay, okay.",therapist
133,223,['N'],-I mean—,client
133,224,['SR'],"So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.",therapist
133,225,['S'],"Well, I can't see it.",client
133,226,['CQ'],You can't se it?,therapist

133,240,['O'],Sure.,therapist
133,241,['S'],"That is gut right there, going to a job you hate, going home, cooking yet missus a dinner, looking after your kids. I mean, that is-- That's what it real mean does, but I don't have that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do.",client
133,242,"['CR', 'OPTI']","Sure. We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas.

I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure.",therapist
133,243,['C'],"I-- Hmm, maybe.",client
133,244,['O'],"Maybe. You're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um—",therapist

133,249,['N'],Mm.,client
133,250,"['CR', 'OQ']","So it seems like what's gonna push in this direction, just tip that balance a little bit to give this other world of go? Because it is new, it's different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's kind of mundane.",therapist
133,251,['C'],"It is the little things, yeah, like waking up, and having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kind of cool.",client
133,252,['CQ'],It's kind of cool?,therapist

Like, if I could do that, yeah, all good but fuck, I have just come out of prison, I don't have any NCEA. I, uh, I had one opportunity and I fucked that because I can't do night shift 'cause I'm lazy. You know? Maybe the world is giving me opportunities and I just don't need them.

133,276,"['GI', 'OQ']","No. So what would convince you to-to make that shift? 'Cause I hear a lot of kind of-- And in this hard, like, y-you've done time and then once you've got a record, the employers- you know, we know, I know that. That's-that's not easy.

133,278,['O'],You know that.,therapist

133,363,['C'],Yeah.,client
133,364,['CR'],"So if you made a decision to go there, it might be a scary as shit but again it seems that, uh, it could work if see it look, this is important, this relationship's important, let me go for—",therapist
133,365,['N'],"Yeah, but my-when I made my decision to not do that yet like I was very clear I understood I know that picture. If I'm gonna make a decision to do this, I kinda need to really-really know what that is. You know, not only to talk I mean-",client
133,366,['O'],Sure.,therapist
133,367,['C'],"-what is the whole plan to-to call-call up you know and say, hey bro, hey bro, uh, how did you do that? I mean, really? Is it—",client
133,368,['SR'],"Yeah. That's-that's what I'm thinking- I'm thinking actually. Here's someone that actually has made a different decision then, uh, it sounds like that's the pathway that starts over here and I'm wondering. I wonder whether you might have wisdom about what it's like to t-to tread that path.",therapist
133,369,['C'],"Yeah, like, I guess I could be wondering that too.",client
133,370,['CR'],"So you know there's a part of you going, I was thinking in this place that's hard work.",therapist
133,371,['C'],Hmm.,client
133,372,"['CR', 'OQ']",And this is a pretty lonely road to-to walk by yourself. I'm wondering who else might be around you that might actually walk with you?,therapist
133,373,['C'],There's Fiona.,client
133,374,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
133,375,['C'],"[unintelligible 00:26:37] getting out so what-what he did. Um, dad's only as mean. There's Fiona.",client
133,376,['O'],You know maybe they'll walk that road with you too.,therapist
133,377,['C'],"Yeah, okay, uh, all right, yeah. All right.",client
133,378,['O'],There's a couple of people.,therapist
133,379,['C'],Yeah.,client
133,380,['OPTI'],If you want to do that. It gotta be your call.,therapist
9,0,['GI'],"So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The-",therapist
9,1,['N'],Sure.,client
9,2,['GI'],"-the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle.",therapist
9,3,['N'],Okay.,client
9,4,['CQ'],Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?,therapist
9,5,['N'],"Not really, I haven't been stressed. Uh, I've been working steady, you know, these days, I'm glad to have a job, I really am happy that I'm working, so.",client
9,6,['O'],"Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure.",therapist
9,7,['N'],Okay.,client
9,8,['CQ'],"Okay, do you smoke at all?",therapist
9,9,['N'],"I don't smoke. I smoked, you know, as a young adult, quit 20 years ago. I went cold turkey. I was proud of that, haven't even thought about smoking.",client
9,10,['CQ'],"Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?",therapist
9,11,['N'],"Uh, I do drink beer, I drink, you know, two to three pints on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe four or five.",client
9,12,['ADVI'],"Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure.",therapist
9,13,['N'],"Well, I-- you know, my pressure has been high for years and, um, you know.",client
9,14,"['CQ', 'GI']","Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there?",therapist
9,15,['C'],Maybe a little bit.,client
9,16,['ADVI'],"Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well.",therapist
9,17,['N'],Okay.,client
9,18,['CQ'],"Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana?",therapist
9,19,['N'],"I don't use heroin or cocaine. I've never even thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school, 20 years or so ago, I smoked reefer, you know. Once I got out of school, I haven't used that at all.",client
9,20,['CQ'],Okay. Have you ever used any prescription medications that weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?,therapist
9,21,['N'],"No, I don't- I don't, uh, really like the idea of taking pills. Uh, as a matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I had this jaw surgery. They gave me a prescription for Percocet. I took one, maybe feel weird. I think they're still sitting in the medicine cabinet.",client
9,22,['ADVI'],"Okay, excellent. Well, it sounds to me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health.",therapist
9,23,['C'],"Well, I guess I'll try.",client
9,24,"['CQ', 'OPTI']","Okay. And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now. We'll recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this, sound okay?",therapist
9,25,['N'],Okay.,client
9,26,['O'],Okay.,therapist
10,0,['OQ'],Hi. You are [unintelligible 00:00:02]?,therapist
10,1,['N'],Yeah.,client
10,2,"['GI', 'OQ']","Okay. Um, what brings you in?",therapist
10,3,['N'],"Well, I'm supposed to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. Just got diagnosed.",client
10,4,['GI'],Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high.,therapist
10,5,['N'],"Yeah, that's what doctor said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was-- I guess, this is really serious stuff. She was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, but it just sounds massive.",client
10,6,['ADVI'],"Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.",therapist
10,7,['N'],"That's, uh, that's a huge amount of stuff to do and, I'm not- I'm not certain I can do all that, and on top of it, it's-it's-- if I don't get it all done, all this stuff happens to me?",client
10,8,['ADVI'],"So, it sure can.",therapist
10,9,['N'],[sighs],client
10,10,['ADVI'],"So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high.",therapist
10,11,['N'],"Well, I-I [unintelligible 00:01:35]",client
15,0,['OQ'],Can I help you?,therapist
15,1,['S'],"Uh, yeah. I just got off work, and apparently, they're going smoke-free, so I'm-- I-I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and the-- they say they don't work really well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day.",client
15,2,['SR'],"So you want nicotine replacement, but you don't wanna quit smoking?",therapist
15,3,['C'],"Maybe like da-- during the day nicotine replacement. Is that-- I mean, do you have anything like that?",client
15,4,['GI'],"We don't really recommend that. The idea is you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit, so then you wouldn't be smoking at work, but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.",therapist
15,5,['S'],"Well, I don't really wanna quit. I mean, I like smoking. I like go-- after work, I have a beer with my friends, and I'll smoke cigarettes. I mean, it's not really a big deal. Cigarettes aren't that bad. I mean, I know that the-- it's popular to say that smoking is bad for you but, you know, I like it, so I'm gonna be doing it.",client
15,6,['GI'],"Okay. Well, smoking really is really bad for you, you know. It causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease-",therapist
15,7,['N'],"Yeah, yeah. Okay.",client
15,8,['GI'],-oral diseases.,therapist
15,9,['N'],"Okay. Well, what are my options? You know, assuming that I'm right, what are my options?",client
15,10,"['GI', 'OQ']","Well, to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch. I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking. That can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all, I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.",therapist
15,11,['S'],"Well, I mean, I s-- I-I-I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean, I've probably smoked for about five or six years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes, but it's sort of hard to get through the day at work.",client
15,12,['GI'],"Okay. Well, we actually consider 20 cigarettes a day to be a significant amount, and in fact, I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.",therapist
15,13,['S'],"Sounds good to me. The more nicotine, the better. Is it like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. I mean, do you have—",client
15,14,"['GI', 'SR']","Well, there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, and probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day, however, but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.",therapist
15,15,['N'],"Oh. Okay. Well, where is that?",client
15,16,['GI'],"Well, we have that here, but again, the-the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking.",therapist
15,17,['N'],"Well, I-- [sighs] I'm probably not gonna buy anything today. I mean, I just came by to see what my options are. I-- if-- thanks for the input. I mean, do you have anything else, do you have any other advice for me?",client
15,18,['GI'],"Well, aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge, that would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement, but again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.",therapist
15,19,['N'],"Oh, well. Okay. Well, thanks. I mean, I guess that helps a little bit. I'll-- maybe I'll be back later. Thanks.",client
15,20,['O'],Okay.,therapist
17,0,['GI'],"Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you a couple of more background questions.",therapist
17,1,['N'],Okay.,client
17,2,['CQ'],"Do you use any tobacco products, or smoke cigarettes?",therapist
17,3,['N'],"No, I would bum cigarettes in college, but I was never a smoker.",client
17,4,['OQ'],Okay. How about in the last year?,therapist
17,5,['N'],"No, not really anything.",client
17,6,['CQ'],Okay. And how often do you have a drink containing alcohol?,therapist
17,7,['N'],"Um, a few times a week. Uh, Wednesdays, I'll go to happy hour and have about two or three. And then, um, Thursdays, seven, um, seven or eight. Fridays, probably just a couple of glasses of wine with dinner. Um, but Saturdays are bigger night. And I would probably have a few drinks before I went to the bar. And then have four or five at when-when I was out. So—",client
17,8,"['CQ', 'SR']","Okay. So it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week, anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day. So, maybe around 20 drinks a week?",therapist
17,9,['N'],"I guess, it sounds like a lot when you say [chuckles] like that. But yeah.",client
17,10,['CQ'],"Okay. Do you use any street drugs like any marijuana, cocaine, heroin?",therapist
17,11,['S'],"No. I-I smoked weed in college, but just a little bit. I wasn't a regular smoker.",client
17,12,['CQ'],"Do you, um, do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you, or ever use your own prescriptions in a way on which they were not prescribed?",therapist
17,13,['N'],No.,client
17,14,['GI'],"Okay. So, you know, as we said before, you're drinking-- it sounds like you're drinking about 20 drinks a week, over the course of a few days. And I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week, and no more than three on a given day.",therapist
17,15,['N'],Okay.,client
17,16,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","So you're doing more than that right now. And when you drink more than this amount, it puts you at risk for a number of things, okay? Things like greater risk of injury, damage to different parts of your body, um, just a bunch of different problems. And, uh-- so I'm going to recommend that you cut down- cut down that amount to the recommended limit. Again, that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day. Do you think you could do that? Would that be a good goal for you?",therapist
17,17,['S'],That's a lot to change. I don't know.,client
17,18,['SR'],"Yeah, I know that making changes isn't always easy. But when you drink more than what's recommended, it creates problems. You know, you said you hurt your ankle when you came out of the bar this time.",therapist
17,19,['S'],"I mean, the stairs were really steep. So—",client
17,20,"['ADVI', 'CQ', 'SR']","Yeah. Well, it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol. You know, it can actually affect your balance and stability. So, really, you know, for where you are right now, you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended. And, you know, I want you to be healthy. And I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else. So I'm really gonna recommend that you try to cut down to that amount. So, do you think you could do that, cut down to no more than three drinks on a given day?",therapist
17,21,['S'],"Where are these limits from? Um, old- an older population? Because, uh, I drink just as much as my friends do. I mean, everybody drinks like I drink. I'm not even the biggest drinker in my group. So I'm pretty middle of the road.",client
17,22,['SR'],"So, it sounds like, you know, the amount you drink is pretty normal-",therapist
17,23,['N'],Yeah.,client
17,24,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","-amongst the people you typically drink with. But these limits are-- they're actually recommended for all adults. And studies have shown that when you drink more than this, it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about. So, you know, why do you think you drink the amount you drink?",therapist
17,25,['S'],"I don't know. It's what we do. It's-- this is how we have fun, I guess. It is fun.",client
17,26,['ADVI'],"Well, I think you can still have fun within these amounts. So that's what I'm gonna recommend. Um, I think this is a really good goal, and hopefully, we won't see any more injuries. Okay? So why don't you try that?",therapist
17,27,['N'],Okay.,client
17,28,['O'],All right. Thank you so much.,therapist
17,29,['N'],Thanks.,client
27,0,['ADVI'],"I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control. So, we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again.",therapist
27,1,['N'],"Mm-hmm. Yeah, I de-I definitely don't wanna come back here. But, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. But the-",client
27,2,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
27,3,['N'],"-ridiculous part is I've had him for 12 years before, and now it's a problem.",client
27,4,['GI'],"Well, you sound a bit surprised by that. But I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that-that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect.",therapist
27,5,['N'],"Yeah, but I-- Um, let me just clarify, I've seen the materials, I have them-",client
27,6,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
27,7,['N'],"-I have even read them. All I've been doing is taking the medicine. So, I don't know that much about this.",client
27,8,['O'],"Well, uh, wait a second, Sal, what do you mean you-you- ha- If you-- As in-- You know to be informed about-- I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby-",therapist
27,9,['N'],Yeah.,client
27,10,['O'],-a new baby.,therapist
27,11,['N'],"John Carlo, yeah.",client
27,12,['CR'],"-and you are very concerned about your health, you wanna be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps, you've-you've almost quit smoking-",therapist
27,13,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
27,14,['ADVI'],"-which is fantastic. So, the next step is to really deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it's- so- It's gonna be hard to do that. But there are always people who will adopt animals. I'm sure that you have friends or family members.",therapist
27,15,['S'],"Uh, this is a little too much for me now. First of all, John Carlo is taken care of. That's fine. He doesn't have- no asthma from the dog. It's just me. I don't ha—",client
27,16,['GI'],"It's you that I'm worried about, Sal. It's you that I'm worried about, okay? The-the symptoms are worse. You've had two or three major asthma attacks. And-and do you appreciate how-- This is, uh, a risk to your life that there are some-some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it truly is something to take very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough.",therapist
27,17,['S'],"So, Oscar is gonna make me die? He hasn't made me die in 12 years, and the doctor is saying, ""Oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking."" So, what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die? I've had him for 12 years.",client
27,18,['GI'],"Sal, what, uh, do you understand that what happened 6 years ago or 10 years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse. You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher, and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone. You know this.",therapist
27,19,['S'],"Well, they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one, and I'll keep Oscar.",client
27,20,['CQ'],"Sal, you're almost on the strongest one. And if Oscar is that important to you, then do you put Oscar higher than your baby, than your wife? Like, uh, that makes no sense to me. Do you understand how important this is?",therapist
27,21,['S'],"I understand, but I don't think you get my situation. I've had this dog for 12 years. So, I'm not just gonna up and get him out of my house when I don't even know if that's the main thing.",client
27,22,['O'],"Uh, okay, well",therapist
32,0,"['CQ', 'GI']","In summary, the Minnesota State, Mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and then you were transported to detox. Plus, you're only 21 years old. Is the report accurate?",therapist
32,1,['N'],"I-I guess, uh, I don't really remember much. I like it was a week ago, so I was kind of drunk too.",client
32,2,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. Behavior like this could get you suspended, doesn't that concern you?",therapist
32,3,['S'],"Hmm. I mean, not really. I'm gonna be 21 in a couple of months. Um, once I turn 21, the cops can't give me a minor and I mean, I'm not a heavy drinker, like-like my friends or anything. I don't get wasted at all. And, uh, I just need to be careful. I just won't get caught. I'm just trying to find, like, a normal college student.",client
32,4,"['GI', 'OQ']","What were you thinking when you got into your car after having six beers, you could have caused an accident and killed somebody.",therapist
32,5,['S'],"Whatever, I-I didn't though. I called my roommates for a ride. He was sleepy. So I had to get home somehow. And this isn't even my fault. I give him rides all the time, but I didn't do anything.",client
32,6,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","You need to take responsibility for your actions. If you keep partying like this, your problems will only get worse. You're likely to face costly legal citations, poor grades, health problems. Getting kicked out of school and disappointing your parents. You don't want that to happen, do you?",therapist
32,7,['S'],"No-no. Like I said, this isn't even my fault. Like, are we done here? I have class in 15 minutes.",client
32,8,"['CQ', 'GI']","Your behavior is not what Minnesota State University expects of its students. If you wanna be a student here, you'll need to show that you're able to follow our rules. Do you think you can do that, otherwise, you'll be suspended?",therapist
32,9,['C'],"Look, I really like going on the [unintelligible 00:02:29] and I get what you're saying. You, you're making some really good points and I'll think about them. Okay?",client
32,10,['GI'],"Okay. Well, your sanction is you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend an alcohol education seminar that'll cost you $150. Also, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer.",therapist
32,11,['N'],"$150, are you serious? I can't pay that. All right, I'm done with this. I'm over it.",client
44,0,['SR'],"Hey, hi, Andrea. Thanks for coming in today. So I don't know how much you've been told about why you're here, but basically, it's my job just to meet with all the students. I usually meet with you once or twice a semester. And I'm going to be talking to you kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and just the sorts of things like that.",therapist
44,1,['N'],Okay.,client
44,2,['OQ'],So why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself?,therapist

44,7,['N'],I'm an IB student.,client
44,8,['OQ'],Okay. How long ago did you start playing saxophone?,therapist
44,9,['N'],"Well, saxophone. I started about four years ago, but I've been involved in music for about 10 years now, so.",client
44,10,['OQ'],Wow. That's a long time. What other instruments?,therapist
44,11,['N'],I started off on the violin first.,client
44,12,['O'],No kidding.,therapist
44,13,['N'],"So I played that for like six years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different things. And then I found the one- the one for me.",client
44,14,['OQ'],That's awesome. And you play tenor sax?,therapist
44,15,['N'],"Yeah, the tenor sax.",client
44,16,['OQ'],Wow. And how long have you been in marching band?,therapist
44,17,['N'],Marching band since freshman year. So like three years.,client
44,18,['OQ'],Okay. Couple of years. Great. And how do you like Marching Band?,therapist

44,52,['OQ'],Cool. All right. Have you started thinking about schools or majors? I guess you're thinking about psychology as a major.,therapist
44,53,['N'],"Yeah, psychology, I haven't really thought too about which school, I mean, I-",client
44,54,['O'],Right.,therapist
44,55,['N'],"Everyone wants to shoot for the Ivy leagues, so [chuckles]",client
44,56,['OQ'],All right. And how about your grades?,therapist
44,57,['N'],"Uh, they're pretty good, you know, high three-point somethings.",client
44,58,['OQ'],"Okay. Good. Very good. All right. Well, what are the kinds of things do you do for fun on weekends?",therapist
44,59,['N'],"Uh, I usually go out with my friends. Uh, we'll go to the movies or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house-",client
44,60,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
44,61,['N'],-and just hang out and things.,client
44,62,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm. When you're hanging out, is there ever alcohol?",therapist
44,63,['N'],"Sometimes, [chuckles] I'm gonna be honest sometimes.",client
44,64,['OQ'],Uh-huh So how often do you think you drink alcohol?,therapist
44,65,['N'],"Um, depending on how much schoolwork there is When there's not, it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month or something like that.",client
44,66,['OQ'],"Oh, so you're drinking a lot?",therapist
44,67,['N'],"A little, yeah.",client
44,68,['OQ'],Okay. And how much are you drinking on the days that you're-- on the days that you drink?,therapist
44,69,['N'],"Um, I don't, we don't get blackout drunk or anything. It's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing.",client
44,70,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
44,71,['N'],I have gotten blackout drunk before-,client
44,72,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
44,73,['N'],"-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it.",client
44,74,['OQ'],Got it. So you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you've ever had?,therapist
44,75,['N'],Like how many drinks?,client
44,76,['O'],Yeah.,therapist
44,77,['N'],"Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things.",client
44,78,['CQ'],"Okay, so you don't even know.",therapist
44,79,['N'],"So, I'm not-- Yeah.",client
44,80,['OQ'],"Okay. So, and then your friends drink too?",therapist
44,81,['N'],"Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do.",client
44,82,['OQ'],Okay. And how much do they typically drink?,therapist
44,83,['N'],"More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy.",client
44,84,['O'],"Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one drink.",therapist
44,85,['N'],"Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah.",client
44,86,['O'],It has a lot of alcohol in it.,therapist
44,87,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
44,88,['GI'],"Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group.",therapist
44,89,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
44,90,['OQ'],"So, is that surprising to you?",therapist
44,91,['N'],A little bit.,client
44,92,['OQ'],"Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?",therapist
44,93,['N'],"Not too much, to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, you know, within my small group of friends-",client
44,94,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
44,95,['N'],"-and we usually sleep over each other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assaults and things like that.",client
44,96,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
44,97,['N'],But I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything.,client
44,98,['O'],"Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.",therapist
44,99,['N'],Okay.,client
44,100,['OQ'],"So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?",therapist
44,101,['C'],"Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going.",client
44,102,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
44,103,['N'],But we haven't always had it-,client
44,104,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
44,105,['C'],"-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking.",client
44,106,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?",therapist
44,107,['C'],"Um, I would probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be like, ""Hey, guys, I don't think I'm gonna drink today.""",client
44,108,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
44,109,['C'],And kind of see how that goes. Because—,client
44,110,['CR'],"Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work.",therapist
44,111,['N'],"Yeah. It's, you know, it's one thing to control my own drinking, and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-",client
44,112,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
44,113,['S'],"-of, ""Oh, they're gonna think I look stupid.""",client
44,114,['OQ'],"Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?",therapist
44,115,['N'],Yeah.,client
44,116,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?",therapist
44,117,['N'],"My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-",client
44,118,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
44,119,['N'],-those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or.,client
44,120,['CR'],It sounds like you might be better off without them though. They’re-,therapist
44,121,['N'],Yeah.,client
44,122,['CR'],- maybe not very good friends.,therapist
44,123,['N'],"Probably, might be too judgmental.",client
44,124,['NEGO'],"Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking.",therapist
44,125,['C'],Okay.,client
44,126,['NEGO'],"And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend.",therapist
44,127,['C'],Okay.,client
44,128,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?",therapist
44,129,['C'],"Um, I think-- I think the possibility.",client
44,130,['O'],Okay. So-,therapist
44,131,['C'],"I think if you make a good plan, like I think I'd be able to follow through with it.",client
44,132,['O'],"Okay, great. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore.",therapist
44,133,['C'],Yeah. I think I can do that.,client
44,134,['OQ'],"Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?",therapist
44,135,['N'],"Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends. My band friends, we’re focused on band-",client
44,136,['O'],Uh-huh.,therapist
44,137,['N'],-so I can't really—,client
44,138,['O'],"Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this.",therapist
44,139,['N'],Yeah.,client
44,140,['OQ'],"You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?",therapist
44,141,['N'],"Not too much, to be honest.",client
44,142,['NEGO'],"Yeah. Okay. So, setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that tough really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-",therapist
44,143,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
44,144,['OQ'],"-the people who drink a lot, um, since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?",therapist
44,145,['C'],"Um, what should I-- uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let's say, I hang out with my friends and they're like, ""Hey, why aren't you- why aren't you drinking?""",client
44,146,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
44,147,['C'],Like how should I go about that situation?,client
44,148,['ADVI'],"Well, you know, one good option would be to just review with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol. You can say, you know, ""I thought about it, and I realized it's gonna mess up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of risk for my health."" ""I don't want to become an alcoholic."" Um, you know, ""I don't want to get liver disease."", ""I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents-",therapist
44,149,['C'],Mm-hmm.,client
44,150,['ADVI'],"-or getting in fights."" You know, one thing you could bring up is, ""I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know, are at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid, and then people post stuff on Instagram.""",therapist
44,151,['C'],Mm.,client
44,152,['O'],"And you know, that's it for their social life. It's like over.",therapist
44,153,['C'],Yeah.,client
44,154,['O'],So—,therapist
44,155,['C'],"And-and you know, like professional life as well.",client
44,156,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
44,157,['N'],"I don't want that biting me in the butt, [chuckles] in the back.",client
44,158,['ADVI'],"Yeah. So I think just tell your friends you know, you realized there's always bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore, so you're just not going to.",therapist
44,159,['C'],Okay.,client
44,160,['O'],And then-,therapist
44,161,['C'],I think I can do that.,client
44,162,['O'],"-you can tell them to stop too. You know, then that'd be really good. You'd being a good friend.",therapist
44,163,['C'],"It'd be easier as-- You know, as a group we-we all work together to become better.",client
44,164,['OQ'],Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. All right. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?,therapist
44,165,['N'],No. I think- I think I'm good.,client
44,166,['O'],"Okay. So, like I said, I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks.",therapist
44,167,['N'],Okay.,client
44,168,['O'],And make sure that you actually quit drinking.,therapist
44,169,['C'],Okay.,client
44,170,['O'],All right.,therapist
44,171,['C'],Sound good.,client
44,172,['O'],Great.,therapist
53,0,['OQ'],"Hi, Laura. So, thanks for coming in. I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. So, basically, I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. And we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. I'll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things. And then we'll talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. And so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that's all right.",therapist
53,1,['N'],Okay.,client
53,2,['OQ'],Okay. Why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?,therapist
53,3,['N'],"Okay. Um, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school.",client
53,4,['OQ'],Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?,therapist
53,5,['N'],"Um, mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends, things like that.",client
53,6,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends are hanging out, and what- what do you do? Do you go to football games, go to parties?",therapist
53,7,['N'],"Uh, yeah, if it's school-related, maybe like a game or two, or go to the mall, like, to shop or go to the movies or something, and at night, maybe like a party or something if someone's throwing.",client
53,8,['OQ'],Okay. And what kind of hobbies do you have?,therapist
53,9,['N'],"Um, I like to read and I like to go outside and, like, take walks and, like, hike and stuff. I'm very outdoorsy, so-",client
53,10,['OQ'],"Oh, cool. What are your plans for after high school?",therapist
53,11,['N'],"Well, I plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and something like that, hopefully.",client
53,12,['OQ'],That's great. What do you think you'll study?,therapist
53,13,['N'],"Well, I'm-I'm looking at the journalism, maybe pre-law.",client
53,14,['O'],"Oh, neat.",therapist
53,15,['N'],"-which is a little different, but-",client
53,16,['O'],"Yeah, that's great. That's a really good goal.",therapist
53,17,['N'],Yeah. Thanks.,client
53,18,['OQ'],"It's, uh, hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you get?",therapist
53,19,['N'],"Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm getting mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty good, I'm okay.",client
53,20,['CQ'],Okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?,therapist
53,21,['N'],"Um, I think all my grades are A's and B's, so, yeah.",client
53,22,['OQ'],Okay. And do you know where you're going to apply to college?,therapist
53,23,['N'],"Um, I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking into schools like in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll leave home or something.",client
53,24,['OQ'],"Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?",therapist
53,25,['N'],"Um, well, I'm definitely not a math or science person, so I started off by there that I started looking at careers that maybe I would like. So-",client
53,26,['OQ'],"Okay. Great. Sounds like you have, like I said, really good goals and you're working hard in school. Um, you said that when you're going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?",therapist
53,27,['N'],"Um, not really. Maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most.",client
53,28,['OQ'],Okay. And how often do you think you drink?,therapist
53,29,['N'],"Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most.",client
53,30,"['OQ', 'SR']","Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?",therapist
53,31,['N'],Yeah.,client
53,32,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year.",therapist
53,33,['N'],"Possibly, yeah.",client
53,34,"['OQ', 'SR']",So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?,therapist
53,35,['N'],"Yeah, I guess you can say that.",client
53,36,['OQ'],Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?,therapist
53,37,['N'],"Um, just two drinks at a party at the most. I don't-- I don't like to drink a lot. I don't-- Getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. So, I just have, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. It's just like to look like I'm actually doing something. Most of- a lot of the time, I don't even drink at all. So-",client
53,38,['OQ'],But you've been drunk before?,therapist
53,39,['N'],"Um, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk.",client
53,40,"['OQ', 'SR']","Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day.",therapist
53,41,['N'],Yeah.,client
53,42,['OQ'],"Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?",therapist
53,43,['N'],"Um, yeah, yeah.",client
53,44,"['GI', 'OQ']","Okay. Um, so one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car-",therapist
53,45,['N'],"No, I have drunk-driven and never got in a car with a drunk driver.",client
53,46,['OQ'],"Okay. Uh, how much do your friends drink?",therapist
53,47,['N'],"Um, I mean, I have some friends that drink some more than others, like, my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that, but I know that there are people that drink a lot more.",client
53,48,['OQ'],"Okay. What about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?",therapist
53,49,['N'],"Yeah. There are kids that drink a lot more than I do. Definitely, yeah.",client
53,50,['OQ'],And do you hang out with them?,therapist
53,51,['N'],"Not really closely, like, I know who they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like, close friends of mine.",client
53,52,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?",therapist
53,53,['N'],"Um, yeah. That makes sense.",client
53,54,['GI'],"Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted.",therapist
53,55,['N'],Yeah.,client
53,56,"['GI', 'OQ']","You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?",therapist
53,57,['N'],"Yeah, yeah, I have. That's, uh, one of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much.",client
53,58,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
53,59,['N'],So-,client
53,60,['GI'],"And then, um, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook-",therapist
53,61,['N'],Yeah.,client
53,62,"['GI', 'OQ']","And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?",therapist
53,63,['N'],"Yeah. Definitely, yeah.",client
53,64,['O'],But you're still drinking.,therapist
53,65,['N'],"Um, yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thing to do at a party, so-",client
53,66,['OQ'],"Uh-huh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you wanna be an attorney?",therapist
53,67,['N'],"Um, definitely not. That's why I don't try to drink that much. Just-",client
53,68,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
53,69,['N'],"-make it look like I am, kind of.",client
53,70,['O'],"Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talk about some goals for how to be-",therapist
53,71,['N'],Okay.,client
53,72,['O'],-safer.,therapist
53,73,['N'],Okay.,client
53,74,['OQ'],"Um, obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?",therapist
53,75,['C'],"I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol, they are the ones you mentioned, like, health-wise and things like that, so, I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing.",client
53,76,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?",therapist
53,77,['C'],"Um, yeah, I mean, it's not, like, a really big part of my life, so.",client
53,78,['NEGO'],"Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.",therapist
53,79,['C'],Okay.,client
53,80,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?",therapist
53,81,['C'],"Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll just not have a drink.",client
53,82,['OQ'],"Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?",therapist
53,83,['C'],"Um, I really can't control what they do, but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will.",client
53,84,['OQ'],"Okay, and-and what if they won't?",therapist
53,85,['C'],"Well, then, I guess, I'll just try to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party or anything.",client
53,86,['O'],"Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends.",therapist
53,87,['C'],Okay.,client
53,88,['CR'],"'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If they're- if they're the kind of people who are gonna keep drinking-",therapist
53,89,['C'],Yeah.,client
53,90,['CR'],-they're probably not a good influence.,therapist
53,91,['C'],"Okay, yeah.",client
53,92,['O'],"Um, and then, then you'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting good grades now, but when you get to college, it's a lot harder and, you know, if you're needing really good grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol.",therapist
53,93,['C'],"Okay, yeah, definitely.",client
53,94,['O'],"Okay, so, um, that's great 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking.",therapist
53,95,['C'],They would be pretty upset. Yeah. They don't really condone alcohol use.,client
53,96,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
53,97,['N'],So-,client
53,98,['NEGO'],"Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-",therapist
53,99,['C'],Okay.,client
53,100,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","-and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking. Um, is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here?",therapist

53,102,['OQ'],"Okay. Um, any questions or anything-",therapist
53,103,['N'],"Uh, no.",client
53,104,['OQ'],-like that?,therapist
53,105,['N'],I have no questions.,client
53,106,['O'],"Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right. Um, well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class and-and thanks for coming in.",therapist

57,0,['OQ'],Mr. Johnson?,therapist
57,1,['N'],Yeah?,client

57,5,['S'],"Well, to be honest with you, I'm not even certain I'm going to take the medicine. Now, I know I got high cholesterol, I've got to get that down, but on the other hand, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and I just can't afford that.

And I've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from what I hear, where you were there and, you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences, but I did want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.",therapist
72,1,['N'],"Right. Actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as, you know, I'm, um, I'm an honor student. I-I usually I'm studying over the weekend and my parents don't let me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage, to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I- when I got there, like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of the bottle-",client

72,3,['S'],"-or playing random games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. So I wouldn't be- I wouldn't be ostracized.",client

72,8,['GI'],"Yeah. Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure?",therapist

72,11,['S'],"Right. And as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- I expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's a social- that's a social custom in our society. So it's like—",client
72,12,['GI'],"Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then.",therapist

90,1,['S'],"Um, I mean, it was just the, like a social gathering. It wasn't like I was looking for it, uh, the drinks were there and I-- all my friends were doing it and it was just-- it's-it's not something that I like do occa- on occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it-it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes.",client
90,2,['GI'],"But, Tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you know, have a drunk driving accident.

90,15,['C'],Mm. Yeah. I-I-I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to-to a certain degree. And I-- it does make a lot of sense. And I-I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking that—,client
90,16,['ADVI'],I think you really need to quit.,therapist

I don't- I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.",client

And I-I guess I've never really had any-any real experience where the alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.",client
90,22,['NEGO'],"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking.",therapist

92,6,['ADVI'],"Well, I-I need to tell you that the-the medicine that she's taking, the chronic inhaler, which is really essential to controlling her asthma does-- is not a steroid like you're thinking. It's-it's much safer, it's very safe, she-- and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control, and I also want to tell you that, uh, your smoking does affect her asthma, even if- even if it's outside, it gets on her clothes, and to be honest, I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway. But, uh, if you want to keep her out of the emergency room, she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day, and you need to watch your smoking.",therapist
92,7,['S'],"Okay, I-I am not going to allow her to take any kind of steroid. I am not going to allow that to happen. She's my daughter. She's my responsibility, and I'm not going to allow that to happen, and I absolutely make sure that the smoking does not affect her.",client

She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up.

So I think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis.",therapist
102,11,['S'],"But I think that part of the problem is that I-I don't have three to four times- three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even. I mean, hour is a long time because if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there-",client

In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?",therapist

There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call.",therapist

106,17,['N'],I don't know.,client
106,18,['O'],I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.,therapist
106,19,['C'],"I'll-I'll-I'll go look at all those things and-and I'll find-- I guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor about it.",client
106,20,['O'],"Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.",therapist
106,21,['S'],"Okay, whatever. Okay.",client
106,22,['O'],Okay.,therapist
115,0,['OQ'],"Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, David. How are you feeling?",therapist
115,1,['N'],Okay.,client
115,2,['O'],"Good. Here, take a look, see what you think. And that feeling-",therapist
115,3,['N'],Yeah.,client
115,4,['CQ'],"-and the color's okay? You know, there is quite a lot of staining so, um, I'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking.",therapist
115,5,['N'],Oh.,client
115,6,['O'],Possibly-,therapist
115,7,['N'],Gonna get that again.,client
115,8,['O'],"-coffee, tea. Yeah, you've heard this before, I'm sure.",therapist
115,9,['N'],"I do all the above, yeah.",client
115,10,['GI'],"Mm-hmm. So, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. You know, physically, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-",therapist
115,11,['N'],Yeah.,client
115,12,['O'],"-um, healing-",therapist
115,13,['N'],Yeah.,client
115,14,['O'],-in your mouth.,therapist
115,15,['N'],Okay. Sure.,client
115,16,['O'],So--,therapist
115,17,['N'],I've heard it all. I-- but I just want to get my teeth fixed.,client
115,18,['ADVI'],"Yes, and I really want to be helpful. I really want to-- you know, my commitment is to your oral health, so um, there are lots of medications out there, David, that actually take away a lot of the cravings. They're-- they make quitting so much easier.",therapist
115,19,['S'],"I did a pill thing, so I did try it. So like, I did try try it. I just did the pills and they didn't work.",client
115,20,['O'],Mm-hmm. Yeah.,therapist
115,21,['S'],It was a waste and it caused more side effects,client
115,22,['GI'],".No, it-- but David, it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--",therapist
115,23,['S'],Or seven lectures along the road.,client
115,24,['O'],"Well, I don't think I'm giving you a lecture, that's certainly not what I meant. I--",therapist
115,25,['S'],"No. No, I just feel that way. I get really-- I get very defensive about when they bring-- cause I get it from my family doc, from my cardiologist, everybody. I'm like, I'm not a complete fool. I am for smoking, but—",client
115,26,['O'],"Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned.",therapist
115,27,['S'],-but it's not easy to quit.,client
115,28,['ADVI'],"No. But as I said, these medications-- so you've tried the medication, you've been willing once.",therapist
115,29,['N'],Yeah.,client
115,30,"['CQ', 'OPTI']","Then, can I write you a prescription for the medication? Can we talk about how you could use it? Because this is something that-that's very important. Not just for your overall physical health, for your oral health--",therapist
115,31,['S'],I guess I got to really want to and-- things I've tried usually caused me more problems than they helped.,client
115,32,['ADVI'],"Oh no, the smoking's going to cause you more problems than the-- than anything else. I can promise you that, David.",therapist
115,33,['N'],Okay.,client
115,34,['ADVI'],The side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking.,therapist
115,35,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
115,36,['O'],"Like, that's the, I think, thing to really consider.",therapist
115,37,['S'],"Okay. Well, can I go now?",client
115,38,['O'],"I'm-- okay, but you know--",therapist
115,39,['S'],"I-I-I know it, I know- I know, doc, what you're trying to-- but I just don't want to get into that right now.",client
115,40,['ADVI'],"Okay. Well thanks for listening, and honestly, I- I am really worried about the smoking, so--",therapist
115,41,['N'],Okay.,client
115,42,['O'],I um--,therapist
115,43,['N'],I appreciate your care.,client
115,44,['O'],"I'm here to help, okay?",therapist
115,45,['N'],Okay.,client
115,46,['O'],So--,therapist
118,0,['OQ'],"Hi, come in. [door closes] Sit- sit yourself down. Uh, what can I do for you today?",therapist
118,1,['N'],"Well, I've got myself all worked up now I've been sat outside.",client
118,2,['O'],Okay.,therapist
118,3,['N'],"I'm not-- I'm now late. I'm sorry. Um, I've come to see you because I've got a really sore throat. It's been like this for a good few days, um, and I think I need some more antibiotics.",client
118,4,['NEGO'],"All right. Um, okay. Um, well let's, uh, let's just have a look shall we? See what's going on. You just wanna open your mouth for me. Say ah.",therapist
118,5,['N'],Ah.,client
118,6,['GI'],"Okay. Right. Uh, to be honest, you know, looking there, it just looks like one of those viruses that are going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats. So, uh, I think that we should just perhaps go for a bit of paracetamol and, uh, some fluids and let nature sort it out.",therapist
118,7,['N'],"I've been sat here for half an hour. Do you not want to know a little bit more about it, or? I mean, it- it's really painful. I- I've barely been able to swallow today and I'm so worried about passing things on to the kids. Um—",client
118,8,['GI'],"Well, I mean, I'm sorry we're a bit late, but you know that's the general practice, isn't it? You know, sometimes these things happen. Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it.",therapist
118,9,['S'],"[sighs] Well, I mean, this is gonna affect my job. I talk on the phone quite a lot at work, and I'm just-- I don't think at the moment I'm going to be able to go to work. Can- can I, at least, get a sick note?",client
118,10,['GI'],"Uh, well- well, not really. Uh, you need to self-certify in your first seven days off sick so if you're going to take some time off, just take some paracetamol, lots of fluids, get a self-certified note, uh, in to your employer, and put sore throat there.",therapist
118,11,['N'],"Well, I don't think my employer are gonna take that. I mean, they- they've given us so much hassle at things in the past. I mean, can- can I get a private note? Can- can I ask you to write me a letter, at least?",client
118,12,['GI'],"Uh, well, obviously that's a non-NHS thing so we have to charge you for that and our going rate for that is, uh, £12.",therapist
118,13,['N'],Just- it's just not good enough. I just-- [sighs],client
118,14,['ADVI'],"Oh, I'm sorry. But, you know, if you have just got a sore throat, then there's not much I can do about that. It's just, you know, something that we all get from time to time. Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids.",therapist
118,15,['N'],"Parace- paracetamol. Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be for me? I mean, I could lose my job or something.",client
118,16,['ADVI'],"Okay, that's pretty unlikely with sore throat. I think that's so, you know, a little bit of grand staging there.",therapist
118,17,['N'],"I'm sorry, uh, I think I'm gonna say something that I don't- I don't want to, so I'm actually going to go.",client
118,18,['O'],Okay.,therapist
118,19,['N'],Thank you.,client
118,20,['O'],Bye.,therapist
123,0,['GI'],"Okay, I finished the exam. I have some good news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.",therapist
123,1,['N'],That's great.,client
123,2,['GI'],"However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm just wondering what's going on.",therapist
123,3,['N'],I don't smoke cigarettes.,client
123,4,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it.",therapist
123,5,['N'],"Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges.",client
123,6,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
123,7,['S'],"And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. And we got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that-that's got tobacco in it.",client
123,8,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?",therapist
123,9,['S'],"Really? Bad? But they're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars.",client
123,10,['GI'],"Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.",therapist
123,11,['S'],"Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out.",client
123,12,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?",therapist
123,13,['S'],"Well, I didn't really know I'd started.",client
123,14,['OQ'],What do you mean?,therapist
123,15,['S'],"I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.",client
123,16,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",So you're gonna quit then?,therapist
123,17,['N'],"Uh, maybe.",client
123,18,['ADVI'],"What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.",therapist
123,19,['N'],"Well, it's something that I'll have to think about.",client
123,20,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.",therapist
123,21,['C'],"Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back.",client
123,22,['ADVI'],"Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.",therapist
123,23,['S'],"Well, I don't believe that they are cigars. And what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right, and it's something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real.",client
123,24,['GI'],"You're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die.",therapist
123,25,['N'],"Well, it's something that I'll think about.",client
123,26,['ADVI'],"Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change.",therapist
126,0,['SR'],"Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today.",therapist
126,1,['N'],Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.,client
126,2,"['CQ', 'SR']",Okay. It looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?,therapist
126,3,['N'],"No, not really.",client
126,4,"['CQ', 'GI']","Well, you just take it once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?",therapist
126,5,['N'],No.,client
126,6,['GI'],"Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, just call your doctor.",therapist
126,7,['N'],"Okay. Um, why am I taking this medication?",client
126,8,"['GI', 'OQ']","It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh yeah, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?",therapist
126,9,['N'],"No, I guess not.",client
126,10,['O'],All right. Great. Have a good day.,therapist
126,11,['O'],"Hello, Kaylie. I see you're here to pick up a prescription today.",therapist
126,12,['N'],Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.,client
126,13,['CQ'],"Oh, it looks like he called in cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?",therapist
126,14,['N'],"No, not really.",client
126,15,"['CQ', 'GI']","Okay. Well, you take this one once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?",therapist
126,16,['N'],No.,client
126,17,['O'],"All right. Well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, you should call your doctor.",therapist
126,18,['N'],"Okay. Um, so why am I taking this medication?",client
126,19,['GI'],"It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?",therapist
126,20,['N'],I guess not.,client
126,21,['O'],"All right. Great. Well, have a good afternoon.",therapist
126,22,"['GI', 'OQ']","Hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions.",therapist
126,23,['N'],Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.,client
126,24,['OQ'],Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?,therapist
126,25,['N'],"Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this.",client
126,26,"['GI', 'OQ', 'SR']","He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?",therapist
126,27,['N'],He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in.,client
126,28,"['ADVI', 'CQ']","Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you normally take your medications?",therapist
126,29,['C'],"Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.",client
126,30,"['ADVI', 'CQ', 'SR']","Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?",therapist
126,31,['N'],"I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed.",client
126,32,['CQ'],All right. Do you have any children in your home?,therapist
126,33,['N'],No.,client
126,34,"['GI', 'OQ', 'SR']","Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?",therapist
126,35,['N'],He didn't mention anything about that.,client
126,36,['ADVI'],"All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.",therapist
126,37,['OQ'],"Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?",therapist
126,38,['C'],"Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away.",client
126,39,['OQ'],"Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?",therapist
126,40,['N'],"Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.",client
126,41,['ADVI'],"Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month.

130,0,['N'],"Wow. I can't believe he fell asleep after all of that crying, poor guy.",client
130,1,['ADVI'],"Yeah. Well, the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia. It's just an upper re-respiratory tract infection and a cold. So there's some things you can do to make- to help him get better. You can avoid excessive dust. You can keep him hydrated, avoid over-the-counter cold remedies. Keep him away from people who have flu or cold-like symptoms and avoid smoke. And the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy.",therapist
130,2,"['N', 'S']","Well, you're right. I-I did quit smoking when I was pregnant, but actually, um, a couple of weeks ago, I went out, my mom was able to take Jake for the night and my friends they were having a birthday party and we had a couple of glasses of wine and it felt like old times. So before I knew it, I was out having a cigarette with them. And since then I've been having a couple of cigarettes a day, you know, just at the end of the day after I put Jake to bed. But that sounds like it has nothing to do with what you're talking about, right?",client
130,3,['GI'],"No, wait a minute. That has everything to do with what we're talking about. I can't believe at the end of this appointment, you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again. That's very, very important information for me to know. And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now.",therapist
130,4,['N'],"Well, I had no idea that it was such a big deal. I-I didn't think it would have anything to do with Jake getting sick or, you know, hurting him.",client
130,5,['CQ'],"Come on, Hailey. You're here because you thought he had pneumonia. You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? Do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your-your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risks that you're posing to yourself and your own health?",therapist
130,6,['S'],"Well, you know, I-I was doing perfectly well. It was just when I went out with my friends and, you know, usually, I'm fine with the cravings. It's just when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. And if I have more than two or three, I just get that craving for a cigarette. And if I have cigarettes in the house, it just happens. You know, I'm doing pretty good.",client
130,7,['ADVI'],"So it sounds like if you have alcohol, then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do. You need to go home and as your-your son's doctor, I need to tell you you need to go home and throw out those cigarettes. You need to quit.",therapist
130,8,['C'],"Okay. Um, well, yeah, I-I guess I can throw the cigarettes. And tomorrow night when I have my glass of wine, I'll-I'll just try to avoid that craving.",client
130,9,['CQ'],And let's talk some more about wine. You keep throwing wine into the conversation. It sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine. How much are you drinking?,therapist
130,10,['S'],"Only a couple of drinks a night. You know, it's pretty rare if I have anything more than that. It's just my way of relaxing at the end of the day. It's been so stressful since Jake came along. It's just how I fall asleep at the end of the night.",client
130,11,['CQ'],"Well, no one said motherhood was going to be easy, Hailey. So let's talk about these drinks. Are we talking about the-the low-risk drinking guidelines, one to two standard drinks a night or are we talking about a mug of Margarita's?",therapist
130,12,['N'],Well.,client
130,13,['CQ'],What are you drinking? What's the quantity that you're drinking.,therapist
130,14,['S'],"I guess about- I have about a half a glass a night and maybe two. Very rarely I'll have more than that. You know, it just helps me kind of relax.",client
130,15,['ADVI'],There's other ways to relax. There's yoga. There's deep breathing. You need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid. This is not okay. You're not just worrying about Hailey anymore. It's Hailey and Jake. You're a mom now.,therapist
130,16,['N'],I didn't know it was such a big deal. I-I never thought that there would be any impacts on Jake because of it.,client
130,17,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","I'm trying not to be hard on you, Hailey, but I've got to tell you as a position, it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home. You're throwing out your cigarettes. You're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol?",therapist
130,18,['C'],I guess I'll do the same thing. I'll go home and throw out the bottles of wine and stop having a glass at the end of the day.,client
130,19,['ADVI'],"Sounds good. And if you need to relax, go for a walk, join a moms group, read a book. How about you come back in a week when we have Jake's six months checkup and you can let me know how that quit plan is going.",therapist
130,20,['C'],"Okay, I'll try my best.",client
130,21,['O'],Thanks.,therapist
131,0,['O'],Good morning. It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.,therapist
131,1,['N'],Good morning.,client
131,2,['OQ'],"What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?",therapist
131,3,['C'],"Well, I need some medication if you can offer me some.",client
131,4,['O'],"Absolutely, we're in the right place for that.",therapist
131,5,['C'],"And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free.",client
131,6,['OQ'],"Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop.",therapist
131,7,['C'],"It's, uh, just these days-- I think these days I'm-I'm finding that, um, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I'm getting sick of it. It's, you know, I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking.",client
131,8,['CR'],"Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here.",therapist
131,9,['C'],"Especially the other night I was at the restaurant, it was a bit-- you know, it was a bit embarrassing I'm the only one walk walking out.",client
131,10,['CR'],And so that-that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly and it's getting embarrassing.,therapist
131,11,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
131,12,['CQ'],Any other reasons?,therapist
131,13,['C'],"Um, it's expensive these days.",client
131,14,['CQ'],How much does it actually cost you a week?,therapist
131,15,['N'],"It's-it's about-- Um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost £7.",client
131,16,['CQ'],£7 a week or a day?,therapist
131,17,['C'],"£7 a day today, so-",client
131,18,['O'],So your pack a day—,therapist
131,19,['C'],"-you're talking about £40, uh—",client
131,20,['SR'],£50 a week.,therapist
131,21,['N'],£50 a week.,client
131,22,['O'],"Even more mess, you see.",therapist
131,23,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,24,['SR'],Okay. So we're talking about spending £50 a week-,therapist
131,25,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,26,['SR'],"-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons.",therapist
131,27,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
131,28,['CQ'],Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?,therapist
131,29,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,30,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","Great, okay. So have you got a date in mind when you'd like to stop smoking?",therapist
131,31,['N'],"Well, what you do-- What do you suggest?",client
131,32,['ADVI'],"Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains.",therapist
131,33,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
131,34,['OQ'],What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it?,therapist
131,35,['S'],"Um, it's just entertainment. Something, um, when I bored, it's got-- I've got-- I smoke-",client
131,36,['O'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
131,37,['C'],"-or sometimes I go out, but as I said, I'm the only one kind of outside.",client
131,38,['OQ'],Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about it?,therapist
131,39,['S'],"The-- Um, it takes away a lot of my stresses.",client
131,40,['OQ'],"Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses?",therapist
131,41,['N'],"Just, uh, when I- when I go down, uh, for-for a break at work.",client
131,42,['OQ'],Mm-hmm.,therapist
131,43,['S'],"I never go down, I just need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, uh, I-I really enjoyed that. The cigarette just helps me calm down.",client
131,44,['CQ'],Yeah. And what is your favorite cigarette of the day?,therapist
131,45,['S'],It's definitely the one at the end of the evening.,client
131,46,['SR'],"Okay, so the end of the day-",therapist
131,47,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,48,['CR'],"-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time.",therapist
131,49,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,50,['OQ'],"Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette?",therapist
131,51,['C'],"I guess, um, I'll just- I'll just have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a cigarette in my hand but to try and give myself regular breaks maybe, I don't know.",client
131,52,['O'],Okay.,therapist
131,53,['N'],It's one of those tough things.,client
131,54,['CQ'],Have you managed to stop smoking in the past?,therapist
131,55,['C'],I've managed for a couple of weeks.,client
131,56,['OQ'],Okay. And what got you back?,therapist
131,57,['N'],"It was, um-- To be honest, it was stress from an argument with my partner I remember.",client
131,58,['SR'],So something just happened-,therapist
131,59,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,60,['CR'],"-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and you don't really like the smell.",therapist
131,61,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
131,62,['CR'],"The main reason that you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a little stress that's going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with.",therapist
131,63,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
131,64,"['CQ', 'CR', 'NEGO']",What you'd like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of like choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible. When do you think would be a good time for you to choose to be your quit date?,therapist
131,65,['N'],"I guess, um, at the weekend I've got a party coming up.",client
131,66,['O'],Okay.,therapist
131,67,['N'],"So, uh, maybe Monday morning.",client
131,68,"['OPTI', 'SR']","So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the things that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen people using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP.",therapist
131,69,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
131,70,"['NEGO', 'OQ']","So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings?",therapist
131,71,['C'],"Yeah. I'm thinking, um, one of these patches.",client
131,72,['SR'],"Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and-",therapist
131,73,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,74,"['ADVI', 'SR']","-and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stopping smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chance of success four times greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's really good that you've come to see me. Now, what you said is you really want to do it and that next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party is over and done with.",therapist
131,75,['N'],Mm-hmm.,client
131,76,"['ADVI', 'OQ']","You've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette. So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you're having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with. Often, a person who smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving for a cigarette. What does it feel like to you, when you can't have a cigarette and you want one?",therapist
131,77,['N'],I just get irritable.,client
131,78,['O'],Okay.,therapist
131,79,['N'],Yeah.,client
131,80,['NEGO'],And that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happening to you.,therapist
131,81,['N'],Hmm.,client
131,82,['ADVI'],"So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week.",therapist
131,83,['N'],Okay.,client
131,84,"['CQ', 'NEGO']","So, you're happy with the date for [unintelligible 00:06:16]?",therapist
131,85,['N'],"Yeah, absolutely.",client
131,86,"['CQ', 'NEGO']",Okay and would you like to come back and see me again?,therapist
131,87,['N'],"Well, definitely.",client
131,88,"['NEGO', 'OQ']",And what would you like me to do if you don't come back?,therapist
131,89,['N'],A nice phone call.,client
131,90,['NEGO'],I'd be very happy to do that.,therapist
