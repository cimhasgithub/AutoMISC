0,high_001,counsellor,hey Monica how are you doing today
1,high_001,client,I'm okay right now but I'm a little anxious because thinking about how Black Friday is soon and my friends want to go to the mall for Black Friday but I really can't go and I want to go but I really to interesting
2,high_001,counsellor,so it sounds like you really want to go to Black Friday with your friends you're feeling a little anxious about it
3,high_001,client,yeah Monaco but interesting but I was thinking about it and maybe if I could make an image or something that I could use while I'm there maybe I'd be able to go so I was wondering if I could give you that very well
4,high_001,counsellor,that sounds like a great idea can absolutely do that
5,high_001,client,okay
6,high_001,counsellor,so we have some materials on the table but if you'd like to use anything else that we've used previously just let me know and I'll get them to you for you

13,high_001,client,ok I think I'm done
14,high_001,counsellor,all right is there anything you'd like to tell me about it
15,high_001,client,well I'm sure um I drew mountains and lake because when I think about things like Unicom I think of nature so I drew a scene that I think would keep me calm
16,high_001,counsellor,so it sounds like nature and mountains are coming to you do you think that this will be helpful I'm black Franny
17,high_001,client,yes as long as I can remember to think about this image when I'm there but maybe I'll bring it with me when I go so I can refer to it when I'm anxious
18,high_001,counsellor,that sounds like a great idea
19,high_002,client,hi there I'm just here to get a refill on my insulin prescription
20,high_002,counsellor,hi my name is Laura I'm the pharmacist let me just look you up in the computer

26,high_002,counsellor,okay I see that you've filled it here before
27,high_002,client,mm-hmm
28,high_002,counsellor,tell me about how you're using the insulin
29,high_002,client,okay um so usually at night I'll check my blood sugar and then if it's pretty high like about like 15 or so I'll use it that day so usually end up using it about three or four times a week
30,high_002,counsellor,so you're testing a lot
31,high_002,client,mm-hmm
32,high_002,counsellor,at least every day
33,high_002,client,yes
34,high_002,counsellor,and then you are using the unplanned when you feel like your blood sugars are running high
35,high_002,client,even exactly
36,high_002,counsellor,and how do you feel your implants working for that
37,high_002,client,I think it's good because my sugars aren't about 14 every day so it must be working. It must work her maybe even a couple of days so it's pretty effective.
38,high_002,counsellor,do you feel like you've seen some real improvements on that
39,high_002,client,yeah definitely
40,high_002,counsellor,okay so tell me why you're only using it when your blood sugar goes high
41,high_002,client,oh okay yeah so I was supposed to use it everyday at first I think um which I was like the first week that I had it I started injecting everyday I don't carry about a week it's your to hurt when I was inject here so that's when I started doing it less often thinking if I kind of gave this skin a couple days to heal it wouldn't hurt as much by the next time I I gave myself the injection
42,high_002,counsellor,so you were experiencing some pain who knows what I'd like you to kind of use it a little left off
43,high_002,client,yeah it hurts a lot when I check
44,high_002,counsellor,and you feel like that's really impacting your day
45,high_002,client,mm-hmm I do yeah
46,high_002,counsellor,okay so sounds like you've seen some improvement your blood Sugar's have been sometimes under control what have you discuss with your doctor recently
47,high_002,client,um why has she haven't seen my doctor since I started the insulin so I guess I haven't told him I'm not using it every day like he wanted I hope you I hope you understand
48,high_002,counsellor,well you're here today for the refill and it seems like you're really committed to getting your blood Sugar's under control
49,high_002,client,mm-hmm
50,high_002,counsellor,there are some options that we could discuss about how to reduce pain when you inject
51,high_002,client,okay that sounds good
52,high_002,counsellor,there are also some suggestions that I could make about how to keep your blood Sugar's under control best
53,high_002,client,okay I like below 15
54,high_003,counsellor,hi John
55,high_003,client,hi Justin I'm dropping off a new prescription
56,high_003,counsellor,no problem I have this in stock but I do notice that these prescriptions from the hospital can you tell me more about that
57,high_003,client,yeah I was in the hospital for about ten days I had this infection where the fluids are oh I need my refills they didn't give me any new prescriptions in the hospital
58,high_003,counsellor,"I did have some auto refills for you in the pharmacy unfortunately to return to stock since you weren't able to pick them up. But if you give me twenty minutes, I can get them all ready for you."
59,high_003,client,I twisted my ankle leaving the apartment this morning it's hurting real bad
60,high_003,counsellor,that's terrible John asbestos in your first day coming back from the hospital but I did want to talk to you about one thing the ibuprofen is you're holding especially with your medical condition will have a tendency to reduce blood flow to your kidneys
61,high_003,client,really but they told me I couldn't take Tylenol but I thought that ibuprofen would be okay at the hospital when I first got there they said my kidneys weren't doing too good but when I left they said everything was back to normal
62,high_003,counsellor,well if you don't mind John if we can go over to the side area and I can discuss with you further kind of see your ankle John
63,high_003,client,sure
64,high_003,counsellor,does look swollen does it hurt anymore mark when you move it does
65,high_003,client,no it's the same
66,high_003,counsellor,"I think the best thing for now is to get a cold pack and elevate your ankle to 45 degrees. Let me grab that for you real quick. So this is the instant cold pack. So just basically to activate it, you just squeeze in place it around your ankle and elevate it to 45 degrees. And the reason why I feel more comfortable with this recommendation is because you've told me about your kidney problem in the hospital. I really don't feel comfortable with you're using ibuprofen. And because if your liver condition, the fluid is pooling in your abdomen which is restricting the blood flow to the kidney. Ibuprofen will further restrict blood flow to the kidney. And your blood pressure medication, the lisinopril, there's normally a very good medication that will further reduce blood flow to the kidney. And the total effect of all three of these factors will drastically reduce buffer to the kidney and the kidney failure. And that's why I feel more comfortable with the cold pack recommendation. And if you have further questions, we can talk to your doctor."
67,high_003,client,thanks for letting me know about this I certainly don't want to hurt my kidneys I got enough problems
68,high_003,counsellor,that's why we're here and if you want to walk with me back to the pharmacy I can get all your prescriptions rung up for you
69,high_004,client,Welbeck I'm just not sure that I'm ready to quit I just I just don't think I can do this right now
70,high_004,counsellor,so you're really not confident that you'd be successful long-term
71,high_004,client,yeah pretty much
72,high_004,counsellor,you know like I know quitting is really hard and it takes a lot of strength to go through that but is it the hardest thing you've ever done
73,high_004,client,what must be because I haven't quite yet
74,high_004,counsellor,well in all seriousness is I know there's other hard things you've been through so if quitting really the toughest thing you've ever done
75,high_004,client,no I'm Courtney I mean going to my divorce was difficult
76,high_004,counsellor,and you got through it
77,high_004,client,yeah but there was just different circumstances
78,high_004,counsellor,it is a different type of difficulty you're right and I don't want to make light of that but what I'm the point I'm trying to make with you is that it was difficult and you rose to the challenge and you got through it
79,high_004,client,yeah that's true
80,high_004,counsellor,so what I know of you is that when you're faced with a tough challenge like a divorce you rise to the occasion and you manage to get through it and you come out on top so are you ready for the challenge of quitting
81,high_004,client,yeah you know I hear what you're saying but you know I just don't want to be a failure I don't want to let people down I don't want to let my family down and I I just don't think I'm ready
82,high_004,counsellor,well I do totally respect your decision if you really don't want to quit and you're not open to it then you know that is your choice whatever you choose to do about your smoking habit really is your choice and I do respect that so where do we go from here
83,high_004,client,well I don't want to quit right now but I know that in the past cutting down has helped me
84,high_004,counsellor,cutting down that would be a great step I mean that would be wonderful so I know you've tried before what else have you learned what other lessons have you learned from quitting I'm guessing you've learned a lot of lessons
85,high_004,client,well I know in the past the nicotine gum has helped me I just didn't really care for the taste
86,high_004,counsellor,well I have some ideas on that if you'd be open to hearing them
87,high_004,client,sure
88,high_004,counsellor,they've got a lot of new flavors on the gum they're cinnamon and orange and juicy fruit which is a popular one and mint I've had a lot of people have favorable things to say about the new flavors
89,high_004,client,that's something I didn't know so you think you might want to try it again again in addition to cutting back
90,high_004,counsellor,how about if I cut back for a month and then I'll try the gum
91,high_004,client,I think that is an excellent idea and I think that you really will be able to do it this time
92,high_004,counsellor,I also
93,high_005,counsellor,you Rachel it hurt coming today what brings you in
94,high_005,client,well so I've been working with the weight management clinic and I just when I found out that this was an opportunity I thought why not use this as another resource to help me lose weight
95,high_005,counsellor,and why why do you want to lose weight
96,high_005,client,well so really recently actually my older sister has had a lot of health concerns relate to her weight and it just sort of jostled me a little bit because we're so similar
97,high_005,counsellor,really related to your sister
98,high_005,client,yeah so I've been this weight for a while but like now I feel like this is really the time for me to start making some changes
99,high_005,counsellor,what kind of problems sister experience
100,high_005,client,well so she has some high cholesterol and high blood pressure and I guess those are things that were running my family but I'm really worried because my grandmother has suffered from a stroke and I definitely don't want to do that
101,high_005,counsellor,there's big change gears to get healthy
102,high_005,client,yeah I mean another birthday rolled around and I just realized that I'm not getting any younger thank you thank you but yeah so there's some pressure there too
103,high_005,counsellor,so there's been some big things going on your life that's really prompted your push for weight loss so I just want to check it really quick and so on a scale of one to ten with one being really super important and have to do it starting today where are you in turn taken away
104,high_005,client,oh I would definitely say a ten
105,high_005,counsellor,okay
106,high_005,client,we want right now for me is really really important
107,high_005,counsellor,and what puts you out of 10
108,high_005,client,just kind of all these reminders in the last year and then I'm getting a little bit older all of those things together make it a 10
109,high_005,counsellor,okay bad idea on in that same scale with one being not confident at all to 10 being super super confident where would you say your are in terms of your confidence to actually lose the way
110,high_005,client,Oh honestly I would probably say that I'm like a five or six with confidence
111,high_005,counsellor,and what what promise you to pick a five or six
112,high_005,client,I just like been tried to lose weight before and those things certainly have failed as I still I'm the same way
113,high_005,counsellor,okay
114,high_005,client,that's what really only leaves me at five or six
115,high_005,counsellor,okay so what can we do to get you at say like a nine or ten level of confidence
116,high_005,client,I think I would be more confident if I understood like how do you use some of the gym equipment a little bit more so it's not something that I feel really comfortable doing. I just don't. I know feel very confident when I'm in there except to use the bike and there are elliptical. So some of that could be I would really like to do some strength training but I just don't know how.
117,high_005,counsellor,okay that sounds really interesting
118,high_006,counsellor,hi Andrea thanks for coming in
119,high_006,client,thank you
120,high_006,counsellor,so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself
121,high_006,client,sure um as you know I'm Andrea I uh I'm a junior I'm in the marching band I played at center sacks I mean yeah I'm also in the little bit of a band geek I play you know the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that
122,high_006,counsellor,wow you really are involved in music
123,high_006,client,yeah
124,high_006,counsellor,when did you start
125,high_006,client,I started playing about 10 years ago actually
126,high_006,counsellor,Wow
127,high_006,client,yeah I start on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet finally found the tenor sax hmm yeah
128,high_006,counsellor,very cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun
129,high_006,client,um you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that
130,high_006,counsellor,it's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family
131,high_006,client,uh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog
132,high_006,counsellor,cute what kind of dogs
133,high_006,client,the golden retriever
134,high_006,counsellor,oh nice
135,high_006,client,I'm a big boy
136,high_006,counsellor,very fun all right and how are things going in school for you
137,high_006,client,pretty good grades have been pretty all right still like 3.7 ish
138,high_006,counsellor,okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school
139,high_006,client,I'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something
140,high_006,counsellor,okay you have some pretty big dreams
141,high_006,client,yeah
142,high_006,counsellor,it's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life
143,high_006,client,um I think a sense of community and belonging
144,high_006,counsellor,okay
145,high_006,client,I think those two um respect respect
146,high_006,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three
147,high_006,client,yeah well I think the community belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching band I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal
148,high_006,counsellor,mm-hmm
149,high_006,client,and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so
150,high_006,counsellor,okay
151,high_006,client,I place great importance in that
152,high_006,counsellor,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends
153,high_006,client,um sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out
154,high_006,counsellor,mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved
155,high_006,client,yeah sometimes
156,high_006,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene
157,high_006,client,uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say
158,high_006,counsellor,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking
159,high_006,client,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three
160,high_006,counsellor,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink
161,high_006,client,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah
162,high_006,counsellor,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get
163,high_006,client,definitely
164,high_006,counsellor,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games
165,high_006,client,I think of them as as different. I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather. Versus with a party it's a lot more energetic. It's a after at all it's very draining.
166,high_006,counsellor,mm-hmm
167,high_006,client,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have
168,high_006,counsellor,okay so there's sort of pros and cons
169,high_006,client,oh yeah
170,high_006,counsellor,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol
171,high_006,client,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad
172,high_006,counsellor,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol
173,high_006,client,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid
174,high_006,counsellor,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening
175,high_006,client,sometimes yeah
176,high_006,counsellor,can you tell me a little bit about that
177,high_006,client,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun
178,high_006,counsellor,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened
179,high_006,client,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and
180,high_006,counsellor,okay
181,high_006,client,it kind of put it down around my my fun
182,high_006,counsellor,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol
183,high_006,client,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff
184,high_006,counsellor,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy
185,high_006,client,yeah
186,high_006,counsellor,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions
187,high_006,client,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things. I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something. I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun.
188,high_006,counsellor,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then
189,high_006,client,it sort of defeats the purpose
190,high_006,counsellor,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that
191,high_006,client,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that
192,high_006,counsellor,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or
193,high_006,client,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little
194,high_006,counsellor,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think
195,high_006,client,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into
196,high_006,counsellor,okay
197,high_006,client,too much
198,high_006,counsellor,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like
199,high_006,client,I'd
200,high_006,counsellor,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself
201,high_006,client,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less
202,high_006,counsellor,okay like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22 mm-hmm
203,high_006,client,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community
204,high_006,counsellor,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important and ten as it's the most important thing right now
205,high_006,client,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't
206,high_006,counsellor,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four
207,high_006,client,um because I still think it's it's important
208,high_006,counsellor,uh-huh
209,high_006,client,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that. I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam. I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea.
210,high_006,counsellor,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to
211,high_006,client,I think
212,high_006,counsellor,on that same scale from one to ten
213,high_006,client,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten I know I
214,high_006,counsellor,oh wow okay why did you say ten
215,high_006,client,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather
216,high_006,counsellor,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that
217,high_006,client,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want
218,high_006,counsellor,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or
219,high_006,client,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible
220,high_006,counsellor,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going
221,high_006,client,I think so that's good
222,high_006,counsellor,does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going
223,high_006,client,I'd like to
224,high_006,counsellor,alright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks
225,high_006,client,Thanks
226,high_007,counsellor,hi Lucy nice to see you today how you been going
227,high_007,client,yeah well thanks
228,high_007,counsellor,great I'm just fully get started has anything changed with your medical history since I last saw you like any new medications or serious operations
229,high_007,client,No
230,high_007,counsellor,great and is anything maybe worrying you about your teeth or your gums today
231,high_007,client,I think I might have a hole in my tooth
232,high_007,counsellor,oh no what makes you say that
233,high_007,client,I can feel it with my tongue and it's a bit sensitive
234,high_007,counsellor,mmm well let's lie you back I'll pop some gloves on and we'll have a little look Lucy it definitely looks like you need a filling um I'd love to help you figure out why you've got this new hole in your tooth do you mind if I ask you a few questions so we can try and figure it out
235,high_007,client,Yeah of course
236,high_007,counsellor,great well here's a risk assessment form it's just a few questions that might help us figure out what the problem might be great yeah it says here that you're drinking soft drinks in between meals what do you know about the effect of soft drinks on your teeth
237,high_007,client,I know it's not good for them
238,high_007,counsellor,that's right um the bacteria in your mouth can use the soft drink to create acid that eats into the tooth surface and causes the holes the more that your teeth are coated in the sugar the more likely it is that you'll develop a hole did you know the one can of soft drink can have 10 teaspoons of sugar in it
239,high_007,client,I didn't know that so I shouldn't have soft drinks at all I'm not sure I could do that
240,high_007,counsellor,yeah I understand it does sound like you're worried about getting holes in your teeth though there are a few options that you can do to help improve how you consume sugar would you like to hear about those
241,high_007,client,well I don't like getting feelings so that would be great
242,high_007,counsellor,yeah probably drinking soft drink you could try drinking it all in one go instead of sipping on it or you could try drinking just at mealtimes instead of in between meals so does either of those sound like they might work for you
243,high_007,client,yeah I mainly sort of drink soft drinks in between meals though maybe I could just have them with lunch and dinner
244,high_007,counsellor,great I'm in Romania to get a break from the sugar I sort of on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most how motivated do you feel you are to make this change
245,high_007,client,I don't like getting feelings so an 8 or a 9
246,high_007,counsellor,great and you maybe have any ideas that you could implement to help you avoid having soft drinks in between meals
247,high_007,client,I could carry a water bottle around with me
248,high_007,counsellor,great that's a really good strategy and waters great for you too umm you can also try chewing sugar-free gum I mean is that something you're interested in
249,high_007,client,I might give the water bottle a try first
250,high_007,counsellor,okay cool well look I'll put a little note in your file and the next time I see you if it's okay I'll check how you're going with avoiding soft drinks between meals
251,high_007,client,yeah that'd be fun and hopefully I won't have any holes next time
252,high_008,counsellor,so Jane it sounds like you're angry with your supervisor would what would I be right in saying that
253,high_008,client,well I think I'm pretty angry
254,high_008,counsellor,all right look maybe to help me understand you know more about that anger I'm wondering if you could you know choose two or three pictures here that look like how you were angry at the time which which of the cards here that would show how angry you were okay don't I might just take a look at those okay it does look like anger doesn't it it's a pretty big anger so after you'd had that you know a big thing with your mum you you went to your room right
255,high_008,client,well she got really angry at me because on the way to my room my idiot sister got in the way so I pushed her out of the way she's just annoying so then I went into my room the only place that I really feel safe slammed the door and then mums favorite picture fell on the floor
256,high_008,counsellor,thank you for sharing that with me because it really and being for being so honest about your anger because what it does is help I don't know if it's helping you but it's certainly helping me to understand that this is really big for you and it's a big expression but surprisingly you know anger anger's a good thing in a way because it's it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair that he he just did change the thing without your permission without you knowing so in some ways you had a right to be angry but what happens what I heard you saying in as you were telling me what happened next what happened next was that your anger took charge and he it did more than what it's meant to do your your anger is just just to let you know that you're angry okay but what it did what I feel it did it just pushed you out of the road and said I'm I'm taking control here so Jane when you were angry did you feel it anywhere in your body
257,high_008,client,well my neck is really sore and its really paining and and my shoulders I just it's really like it's it just feels like I've been I've been hit by something
258,high_008,counsellor,the end of the day that that pushing your sister over and yelling at your mum did
259,high_008,client,it's made it worse yeah
260,high_008,counsellor,yes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here
261,high_008,client,you have to help me with that a bit i think
262,high_008,counsellor,we will
263,high_009,counsellor,hi I'm Amy the pharmacist so I understand you have some questions
264,high_009,client,hi I'm Mario my doctor suggested I talked to a pharmacist about quitting smoking do you have the time for this
265,high_009,counsellor,"Sure, why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking. How soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit."
266,high_009,client,my cholesterol and my blood pressure are high my father and my uncle both had heart attacks when they were pretty young so my doctor's been telling me that if I quit I'll cut down on my chances of having a heart attack
267,high_009,counsellor,that's correct quitting would be important for you and it will reduce your chances of having heart problems
268,high_009,client,so that's the situation I've tried to quit a couple of times before but it didn't work so what I was hoping is that you could go over the different options and help me pick the best one
269,high_009,counsellor,hmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them
270,high_009,client,first I tried the gum I like to chew gum so I thought this would be good so I chewed about three to four pieces of gum a day but I was miserable and I started smoking after four days then I tried the patch a couple of months later I felt pretty good for about a week so I quit using it didn't think I needed it anymore started smoking two days later
271,high_009,counsellor,"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you didn't get the full benefit of the product. A few pieces of gum won't get enough nicotine into your body to make you comfortable. You need at least nine pieces a day for it to be effective. And it has to be used in a very specific way, not chewed like regular chewing gum."
272,high_009,client,I admit I didn't read the directions last time
273,high_009,counsellor,as for the patch sounds like it worked for you you just didn't stay on it long enough we recommend 10 to 12 weeks and this gets enough nicotine into your body to help reduce most of the withdrawal symptoms while you work on learning to live your life without cigarettes you were able to quit for a week with it so it seems like it might be a good choice now but there are others as well
274,high_009,client,yeah my doctor said something about a pill I didn't like the taste of the gum much
275,high_009,counsellor,well that's understandable but you should know there are new flavors that my patients say tastes better to be honest all the medications are effective it's just a matter of what you prefer you've already tried the patch there's also a nicotine lozenge a nasal spray an oral inhaler in tablet form we have bupropion which you've probably heard called zyban and there's a newer medication varenicline or chantix
276,high_009,client,yeah I've heard of those but I think I'd rather stick with the patch and this time I'm gonna make sure I keep it on long enough
277,high_009,counsellor,sounds like a good choice for you and given that you have some experience with it and you know that it works for you um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day
278,high_009,client,about a pack a day
279,high_009,counsellor,okay so you'll want to start with the 21 milligram patch for six weeks and then the 14 milligram patch for two weeks and then the seven milligram patch for the last two weeks it's pretty easy to use in the morning of your quit day I want you to put one patch on a hairless part of your upper body and leave it on for 24 hours and the next morning you take that off you put another patch on in a different location you want to switch site so you don't get any skin irritation if you have trouble sleeping you can take it off before you go to bed you read the directions on the box and if you have any questions let me know
280,high_009,client,okay I'm gonna try it again and read the directions and stick with it this time
281,high_009,counsellor,one more thing there are two parts to smoking so there are two parts to quitting it's an addiction to nicotine and a habit the patch will take care of the physical addiction and help with the withdrawal symptoms but you'll have to make changes in your behavior if you want to stay quit for good
282,high_009,client,yeah dr. Ward mentioned that to me and he gave me the card for this quitting line
283,high_009,counsellor,that's perfect our stay quit line is excellent and convenient so let's talk about picking a quit date and we'll get you set up with a box of patches
284,high_010,counsellor,I can I help you
285,high_010,client,yeah I hope so um my workplace is just gone smoke-free hey I'm not not very happy about it I'm going to keep smoking but I was worrying if there's anything that can help be like get through the day it's like you know go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work
286,high_010,counsellor,so your workplace just went smoke free you're not too pleased huh
287,high_010,client,no I'm not going to quit smoking oh my god I like it it helps me relax so I mean I don't see what the big deal is
288,high_010,counsellor,okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the
289,high_010,client,I mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now
290,high_010,counsellor,okay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that
291,high_010,client,sure I can quit
292,high_010,counsellor,okay what makes you so confident
293,high_010,client,well I mean I don't see why I couldn't although I have not ever tried to quit I mean it's just something that I do for fun you know I'm breaks at work in the morning and have to work
294,high_010,counsellor,"mm-hmm and so in terms of a readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of one to ten? where one is I'm not considering it at all and ten is I'm definitely ready, I want to quit"
295,high_010,client,I am probably - I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today I've been totally not gonna quit smoking
296,high_010,counsellor,okay what made you say two instead of one
297,high_010,client,well I mean anything's possible I mean I I guess I could maybe be convinced yeah is there something I mean I are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking
298,high_010,counsellor,well there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke we have products that can help to replace nicotine which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke
299,high_010,client,okay well that's good information I mean I'm not gonna do anything today I just need to know my options but that's encouraging if I decided to quit smoking I do have have at least tools to help me quit
300,high_010,counsellor,sure and back to that skill you mentioned you said you're a - what do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five
301,high_010,client,I don't know I guess if my friends like if one of my friends decided like quit with me that would probably help too but I all my friends love to smoke so I don't see that happening in the near future
302,high_010,counsellor,sure I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free if there will be some people at work who are planning to quit
303,high_010,client,that's a good point I hadn't really thought about that that's a good idea
304,high_010,counsellor,okay well it sounds like you're really here just for information today I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you
305,high_010,client,okay well thanks a lot
306,high_011,counsellor,hi I'm Andrea
307,high_011,client,until nice to meet you
308,high_011,counsellor,nice to meet you so what brings you here today
309,high_011,client,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas
310,high_011,counsellor,that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate
311,high_011,client,it's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal
312,high_011,counsellor,for sure
313,high_011,client,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just
314,high_011,counsellor,so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far
315,high_011,client,yeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you
316,high_011,counsellor,do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done
317,high_011,client,oh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off
318,high_011,counsellor,have you tried anything that might have worked in the past -
319,high_011,client,well we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do
320,high_011,counsellor,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies
321,high_011,client,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of
322,high_011,counsellor,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -
323,high_011,client,hey I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing
324,high_011,counsellor,do you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes
325,high_011,client,I think I've got some of my closest I'm not sharing because we don't really get product reports in them but both classes I do you know yeah I'm doing well and but you know there's so much riding on these next few weeks. I don't do well on these assignments like it could totally mess up all that work so
326,high_011,counsellor,so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good
327,high_011,client,probably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that
328,high_011,counsellor,completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week
329,high_011,client,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be
330,high_011,counsellor,so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you
331,high_012,client,I pick up a prescription

349,high_012,client,uh you know I started to get a really bad pain in my legs and that's what led me to go to the doctor you ran tests and that's when he said I had sensitivity to it
350,high_012,counsellor,okay well hopefully you won't have any issues like that with this one I'll be sure to go over this with you okay

393,high_012,client,yeah all right
394,high_012,counsellor,thank you mr. seeders take care you
395,high_013,counsellor,there's great seeing you thank you for coming to diabetes clinic today my name is Mark Smith I'm a pharmacist I work with dr. Pham and I we run the diabetes clinic and we basically serve to educate our patients so that I can better manage their their diabetes and looking at your chart I see that you are pre-diabetic so what we're going to do now is kind of focus on nutrition mostly diet and exercise okay
396,high_013,client,dr. Pham already made me get a nutritionist I know what you're going to tell me so Kyle Eve
397,high_013,counsellor,okay okay that's fine I'm glad you had the opportunity to talk with the nutritionist I'm she's a very nice lady and she has some very valuable information do you mind telling me some of the things that she discuss with you
398,high_013,client,it's the same stuff you're gonna tell me
399,high_013,counsellor,okay well I will show you what I normally go through with my patients and then you can let me know if there's any information that you covered with the nutritionist or any of the material it's new to you then that would be great as well basically we feel that going over the nutrition aspect of diabetes and pre-diabetes is so important there's so much that we can do without taking medications and we've seen many patients that have benefited from making just minor changes to their diet that are greatly impacted their health in a very positive way so to start off I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what you eat to get a better picture of your diet so first what did you have for breakfast
400,high_013,client,couple eggs bacon biscuits great
401,high_013,counsellor,okay all right and then what about lunch
402,high_013,client,turkey sandwiches and chips
403,high_013,counsellor,okay chips and then for dinner
404,high_013,client,spaghetti salad bread
405,high_013,counsellor,okay spaghetti salad and bread okay so tell me then what about any snacking that you do throughout the day like any snacks or anything like that
406,high_013,client,"I don't really snack but sometimes ice cream after dinner. It may be free in between meals. Benign occasion, not very often."
407,high_013,counsellor,okay and also what kind of beverages and things that you drink what are some of the things that you drink throughout throughout your day
408,high_013,client,or constant constantly feeling hydrated some thirsty so I drink sweet tea all day long
409,high_013,counsellor,okay okay well thanks for sharing a bit of information within this patient this kind of gives us a better idea of what you throughout the day so now I'm going to give you some information or show you some information about nutrition okay
410,high_013,client,all right know what you're going to say I need to eat less I've heard it all before it doesn't work for me so good
411,high_013,counsellor,okay all right so that's that's that's my ministrations but just just kind of bear with me so when I gather from your best far as that you know already you're fully aware of the things that you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself however you seem to find it difficult and you don't think that it works for you is that that's kind of the fish that I'm getting so explain to me what are some of the barriers that you feel exists that prevents you from eating healthier and losing weight
412,high_013,client,it's mostly the money it's expensive to buy foods that are healthy and I just can't afford it consistently also like foods it tastes good I hope these stuff doesn't taste good and I just don't want it and also my kids want the good taste in food so they wouldn't even eat it if I made healthy food
413,high_013,counsellor,okay okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine
414,high_013,client,honestly I only have one I haven't exercised in years just don't feel like it put all the money to join again
415,high_013,counsellor,okay okay and then what are some of the barriers you believe that prevent you from exercising on a regular basis
416,high_013,client,well kids they take a lot of time group and money like I said gym memberships or there's several close to my home but they're too expensive for me to get and I just don't have enough time the kids take a ball a day of the day and then work
417,high_013,counsellor,all right and then what what ultimate benefits let's talk about benefits what benefits that you feel that you can ultimately gain by by seeking out more nutritious foods and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen regimen and an overall losing weight what do you think would be the benefits of doing all that
418,high_013,client,I guess it's good for you. Dr. Pham always gets mad at me and says I'm not healthy and always talks about my weight.
419,high_013,counsellor,okay
420,high_013,client,maybe
421,high_013,counsellor,okay maybe yes yes ma'am well and and then those things are exactly correct on what I would like to do miss Fisher I know that you're pressed for time I'm not going to take too much of your time but I would like to schedule min and I and basically sit down with you and kind of go over some some helpful alternatives and basically look at some cost effective type thing since cost is an issue with you and then also look at some resources that we can channel into when it comes to exercise you'll soon find out that some of the exercises that you can do they don't even require a gym membership so you know if that's something deal at because you mentioned to me that time and money are contouring for you so we basically want to work with you together to see if we can get something that that better suits you you know and get you on the right track when it comes to your pre-diabetes and overall losing weight so would you like to come in and scheduling Pullman with us about a week from now
422,high_013,client,yeah I mean you can help me with the finances and Ty
423,high_013,counsellor,yes ma'am yes ma'am I believe that so what what we do is we'll schedule a week from now and but it was it was a pleasure talking with you and I very much look forward to working with you okay all right yeah we good rest of the day okay all right
424,high_014,counsellor,hi I'm Andrea
425,high_014,client,until nice to meet you
426,high_014,counsellor,nice to meet you so what brings you here today
427,high_014,client,well I just been feeling really stressed out lately because it's coming to the holidays and my teachers have decided to lower the class with everything these next couple weeks so it is overwhelmed with it all I had I have like feel like I have so much stuff to do and what are those personalities like for crafting a variant I can't with what I have to do and I wanted to well but I trust I'll be doing that and have the holidays I'm trying to prepare to my home Thanksgiving lots of stuff going on then and then boy is coming to visit me for Christmas
428,high_014,counsellor,that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate
429,high_014,client,it's like if it was just the work if you find that I'm stressed about that too and I'm worried about me even think oh it sounds kind of silly but you know your boyfriend coming home for Christmas is kind of a big deal
430,high_014,counsellor,for sure
431,high_014,client,and it's like I wanted to like my family but I I'm not excited you didn't put him to be bored you know I mean that's I shouldn't even be in my mind you know I should be totally focused on school right now it's just
432,high_014,counsellor,so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far
433,high_014,client,yeah actually I've been doing a lot better in this semester and I think that because of it I wanted to want to keep to move on I want to get I like I'm over a cheer instance I like skip good grades but that makes the procrastination like I'm really good at working under pressure but I can't work under pressure with this up because if I don't start doing in advance I won't get it done and I'm trying to figure out how to just balance to you
434,high_014,counsellor,do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done
435,high_014,client,oh I guess just I've considered you know being very turning off all of my electronics of when my computer I'll need it to do the whole market and doing like a to-do list and just really disciplining myself that you know I have to do it but as soon as I get my computer and like Facebook and gave you the things that distract me I keep finding myself putting it up and putting it off
436,high_014,counsellor,have you tried anything that might have worked in the past -
437,high_014,client,well we recently had fire home and we did the whole fascinating and I fasted like my computer completely I was a lot more with internet at all and to really do anything with electronics and I think that just having that goal in my mind and because it was forgotten I was able to really just not do it and I did so much homework during that week that I've ever done so maybe just really sitting at one with God could help me to better I should I should do it it's just so much easier said than done you know because we're college students who want to go have fun and we wanted to be with our friends but I mean I've had to cancel all my plans and this is why purple holidays at lunch sometime a benefit just frustrating me the teachers you know I mean I know that they did all something followed but there's just so much to do
438,high_014,counsellor,it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies
439,high_014,client,I think that you know girls are always overachievers and we can't just chill and like even my fans always like why don't you just relax they're plump up your deal but I'm trying to think that but I don't like it's a big deal school some things ago because I'm not really talented with my music okay dance or any of those things but so many people are into it so school is like my gift I do good and I understand it so to not feel secure and that is kind of
440,high_014,counsellor,so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -
441,high_014,client,hey I guess it is a lot of pressure I mean I remember in high school my brother was like the good pop and he's older than me he would come back with bad grades and I would come off straight A's I'm so excited you know tell me about your day Ethan Anthony was just like give him all these pitches he did so bad the whole time I always wanted to shine maybe I do need to just relax and know that the day-to-day thing
442,high_014,counsellor,do you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes
443,high_014,client,I think I've got some of my closest I'm not sharing because we don't really get product reports in them but both classes I do you know yeah I'm doing well but you know there's so much riding on these next few weeks I don't do well on these assignments like it could totally mess up all that work so
444,high_014,counsellor,so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good
445,high_014,client,probably just do it talk about it but I guess it's just nice to know that
446,high_014,counsellor,Completion with that and going the holiday. Do you feel like when you do? How do you feel? Stressful week.
447,high_014,client,toy was always really really relaxing so I think that'll be good it's kind of like a reward for getting through it but then I have I mean these goodies won't need a week and I feel like we'll be doing a lot in preparation for my boyfriend coming for Christmas so it won't be everlasting back for three more weeks of school and then like columns here and no it's like breach I mean it should be
448,high_014,counsellor,so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you
449,high_015,counsellor,can you talk about the transformation that you see in people
450,high_015,client,it's it keeps me coming back to work every day you know I get to see them walk in and I get to see that transformation slowly and it's beautiful you know you don't you can't beat that
451,high_015,counsellor,"I mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery. but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation, when does that usually occur?"
452,high_015,client,I think it's different for everyone I mean and we really can't tell who's going to make it by who has a better you know a bigger desire. It's a journey and it's this process and so sometimes it happens where you see that light come on. Sometimes they're struggling and they're discharging and that's that's probably the most difficult part of the job. Knowing that someone's not ready to be brought back to their environment and yet that's what has to happen you know. It's a transitional period so.
453,high_015,counsellor,so they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave
454,high_015,client,yeah because it's you know this is a family disease so when you know you leave that environment that was totally chaotic when you leave like the partner and the kids and the bills and the job and the everything and you remove yourself from that environment may you get popped back into it it's like the people around you assume that great you're finally home because now you can take care of the kids and pick up the you know dry cleaning and you know it's they expect you to be there the way you were and so much more and it's completely unrealistic and you know that they're not willing to change their behaviors if they're still going to be able to drink or have pills or whatever it is and it's it's not okay it's not safe and so that it's a difficult thing
455,high_015,counsellor,is there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases
456,high_015,client,I think that's a common like idea is that oh the ones that have been through treatment a bunch are more difficult or those who have you know just been unsuccessful and they've tried or they've grown up in this environment or that environment and you know it's everyone is different. that's why I I personally have a very eclectic approach to each individual and I work with a fantastic team that I can run things by you know people who have stronger knowledge base on certain things so I think everyone has to be approached individually.
457,high_015,counsellor,so I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it
458,high_015,client,absolutely my wife Sonny had a period of sobriety and she relapse back in May we have a small child we have two and a half year old son
459,high_015,counsellor,there's always another chance no matter how bad it gets is it possible can we talk to your
460,high_015,client,15 years and I put my step worth on the back burner and I went out. I was shooting dope. I was shooting heroin and meth in my neck every day. And you know working and treatment trying to work there still you know. And it's trying to go to this meeting and be secretary still high you know. I said I wouldn't get high at work and you know that. I'm trying to find a vein in the bathroom all night. I had no mental defense against the needle. I stole medication. I went to sober living. After sober living I used there and I use there and I use there. And I go on until I start doing things that are shady. Since I realized I've been able to put together more than a week.
461,high_015,counsellor,is there a willingness or you are you basically giving up
462,high_015,client,what's what's gonna do this time you know why is this place gonna be magical
463,high_015,counsellor,so what I'm asking you at this point will you give it one more shot and are you willing to go to treatment
464,high_015,client,another
465,high_015,counsellor,at this point what do we have to lose you know what's scary
466,high_015,client,I get the all right
467,high_015,counsellor,thank you so much for doing this i know that it hasn't been easy
468,high_015,client,no problem
469,high_015,counsellor,how are you doing first of all
470,high_015,client,i'm doing excellent i feel great
471,high_015,counsellor,there was one part where we actually asked her it was cut out we said you know do you want to go to treatment she says
472,high_015,client,can I bring my cell phone like I don't know about that but you know I I you went to Spencer Recovery Center and I worked there so I'm able to see the transition as well I don't work in and him with you but Carrie does
473,high_015,counsellor,you know you you were honest about being a manipulator you were honest about the other programs you went to what's it like now for you what was it like what was different about this place
474,high_015,client,you know I'm not really sure but there is something different I mean I don't know if it's with me or just with my like a psychic kind of change you know going in there except not being out of maybe desperation but just out of my own choice just to be like all right I'm gonna do something different with my life this time and really try and then I had a hard time for a little bit and I really worked with Carrie like to address some of my other issues that might be going on you know other than if I'm relapsing that much maybe there's something else going on with me besides just my addiction you know
475,high_015,counsellor,but you've worked hard it hasn't been easy
476,high_015,client,no it hasn't I've had some struggles like just mental struggles you know when you get back into mode to a relapse it's like or feel that feeling and then you know if to just pray on it and just like so something else can intervene and like besides yourself you know because i did and God stepped in and took those things away you know like because once you're in that mode it's very hard to once you're locked in a mode that you decided to use or like that you're getting feeling like you may want to it's very hard to get yourself out of that and I managed to pull myself out of that with the help of Spencer
477,high_015,counsellor,the transition that we see just on the outside as well I mean people at home need to see that because when you're working for a facility at one point shooting drugs into your neck and then your back at home wondering how am I everyone do this because every Center that I went to i manipulated it and I ended up pulling one over on them and Here I am again back at home shooting drugs or using suboxone or whatever it is that you were doing I like to just take a few minutes to have your your dad and you have a little boy come up and talk to them just for a fitting
478,high_016,counsellor,why miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center dr. Sheila asked me if I would spend some time with you today I'm really glad that you here I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me
479,high_016,client,well I came to see dr. Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something
480,high_016,counsellor,yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that
481,high_016,client,I suppose
482,high_016,counsellor,okay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit
483,high_016,client,he told me to fill that out and bring it with me
484,high_016,counsellor,okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting
485,high_016,client,typically
486,high_016,counsellor,yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive
487,high_016,client,wine with my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four so my stress is increased
488,high_016,counsellor,so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that
489,high_016,client,okay
490,high_016,counsellor,okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot
491,high_016,client,I fill the glass up so maybe a little more than
492,high_016,counsellor,yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and 1/7 in one week
493,high_016,client,so in total
494,high_016,counsellor,how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that
495,high_016,client,mmm
496,high_016,counsellor,so what do you make of all that
497,high_016,client,well that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive
498,high_016,counsellor,yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol
499,high_016,client,well you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what
500,high_016,counsellor,so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you
501,high_016,client,um well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden
502,high_016,counsellor,yeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking
503,high_016,client,yeah kind of defeating the purpose there
504,high_016,counsellor,22 the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more
505,high_016,client,maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress
506,high_016,counsellor,yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying
507,high_016,client,well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed
508,high_016,counsellor,and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the two imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10 i below the visual here with that if zero is not important ten is very important to do something about your drinking way
509,high_016,client,mm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a 7
510,high_016,counsellor,mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a 7 or a 504
511,high_016,client,well again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and so you know all those responsibilities
512,high_016,counsellor,there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale
513,high_016,client,um well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress
514,high_016,counsellor,yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking
515,high_016,client,I'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight
516,high_016,counsellor,okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit just in case but
517,high_016,client,you know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time
518,high_016,counsellor,so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit
519,high_016,client,well again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth
520,high_016,counsellor,okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress
521,high_016,client,well I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of
522,high_016,counsellor,one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone
523,high_016,client,that'd be nice
524,high_016,counsellor,right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future
525,high_016,client,all right thank you very much
526,high_016,counsellor,you're welcome
527,high_017,counsellor,so Chris they wanted to talk to you you know you're one of our starter athletes we really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and I understand you were there and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now
528,high_017,client,okay Oh actually could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately well prior to that party like as you know I'm an honor student and my parents did keep me very like kept down out of the lake so like social life and about a month ago my friends they invited me into a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party and um well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house so I that's when I started drinking it was a unique experience as you could say I guess you can say and I don't know I was fun at least in the moment so I kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing she asked me to like to promise her no alcohol no drugs man I'll pick you up by 12 and I was surprised twelve was told us basically when the party starts but I told her whatever I thought I thought to myself that I'll come home figure out to delay her call me pick me up later so later so she I promise she dropped me off I promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go I have fun like I've been having and I was drinking and then it's time the time came for her to pick me up and as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up and as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car she said you drank vodka and I'm like I I didn't know what to say I just looked at the floor and I feel terrible because I I betrayed my mother I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol and that's exactly what I did
529,high_017,counsellor,so here you are you're an honor student you're star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence
530,high_017,client,right like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends we're instead about instead of studying I'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that
531,high_017,counsellor,it's really changed your focus yeah what do you like about drinking
532,high_017,client,"I don't know if it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part. Not well, not when I'm doing sports. But like, you know, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily."
533,high_017,counsellor,so helps you kind of used to not feel more relaxed
534,high_017,client,exactly
535,high_017,counsellor,sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe
536,high_017,client,China
537,high_017,counsellor,any other things
538,high_017,client,just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed
539,high_017,counsellor,so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now
540,high_017,client,a little bit because not all of them are into that so like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person there's another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before
541,high_017,counsellor,okay
542,high_017,client,as they are there for me
543,high_017,counsellor,well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships it's affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom where do you think you should to kind of go from here
544,high_017,client,oh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen
545,high_017,counsellor,mm-hmm
546,high_017,client,it's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow it's little I guess it may seem to other people like created it it's a big thing
547,high_017,counsellor,your mom is really important to you
548,high_017,client,of course
549,high_017,counsellor,and how she feels about you is important
550,high_017,client,exactly
551,high_017,counsellor,how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit
552,high_017,client,a lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my schoolwork again my athletics okay I feel that there's a feature in that
553,high_017,counsellor,how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit
554,high_017,client,I'm pretty confident especially
555,high_017,counsellor,on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all antennas completely when
556,high_017,client,I'm probably like an eighth of nine I mean I can't be a ten just nothing's a 10 in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined
557,high_017,counsellor,why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than 6 or 7
558,high_017,client,because I don't know I feel - turn to determine - to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience it-it's not something that I wish to enjoy so even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking
559,high_017,counsellor,all right what do you think's a realistic goal for you then
560,high_017,client,to make sure I have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if I have time I need your time like oh I'll go party with my friends and just be as I party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do one cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure
561,high_017,counsellor,your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most
562,high_017,client,exactly just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though
563,high_017,counsellor,yeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this I know it seems like something it's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum sounds like something that'll work for you
564,high_017,client,and thank you for listening listening to me that's me
565,high_017,counsellor,yeah that's my pleasure as part of my job as part I like best so I'm gonna hurry up and get changed for practice

628,high_019,counsellor,get out of it you mean gonna have the charge

630,high_019,counsellor,so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-
631,high_019,client,um I don't know I really am not sure I just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make it change but I'm just not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life
632,high_019,counsellor,all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to
633,high_019,client,mm-hmm yeah
634,high_019,counsellor,so you're stuck there
635,high_019,client,yeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better
636,high_019,counsellor,when you drink do you ever socialize at the same time
637,high_019,client,I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like that I am at my house
638,high_019,counsellor,alone safety of the marijuana
639,high_019,client,yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kinda by myself I mean I smoke every day so thought it was with people I'm doing it
640,high_019,counsellor,so doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using
641,high_019,client,no not really
642,high_019,counsellor,what are you losing
643,high_019,client,I kind of just like use it to like cope. I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago. Like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seemed to help once after the injury.
644,high_019,counsellor,this is the alcohol in there one
645,high_019,client,mm-hmm
646,high_019,counsellor,so you take it for pain relief equalities
647,high_019,client,yeah
648,high_019,counsellor,any other reasons
649,high_019,client,um it's just easier it's just the marijuana like relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when I'm using
650,high_019,counsellor,like forget about problems
651,high_019,client,yeah
652,high_019,counsellor,so it affects your mood in a positive way
653,high_019,client,yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then just it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I don't have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings
654,high_019,counsellor,have you used since you had the DUI
655,high_019,client,um I haven't drank but I've smoked like I've cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using
656,high_019,counsellor,alright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law
657,high_019,client,yeah
658,high_019,counsellor,how do you figure those two things out
659,high_019,client,I don't know I don't know if there's a way to figure both of my I just know like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking you not using marijuana he had imagined it
660,high_019,counsellor,all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future
661,high_019,client,um I guess I hadn't really considered that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible not get any more charges or anything like that not be in this situation again
662,high_019,counsellor,so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future
663,high_019,client,Um I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just turning like right before try to like avoid that situation again
664,high_019,counsellor,so with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble
665,high_019,client,yeah
666,high_019,counsellor,the first you have to get out of trouble this time
667,high_019,client,yep
668,high_019,counsellor,so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it
669,high_019,client,I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I drink mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like if my friends called me up and said hey do you want to go out tonight like not drinking with them
670,high_019,counsellor,so there is a social component here
671,high_019,client,yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like 9 to 5 jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekends and things like all of my friends who I do have they all do drink all right
672,high_019,counsellor,so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink
673,high_019,client,um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out when we got like really drunken I would just feel like out of place
674,high_019,counsellor,so it'd be socially awkward
675,high_019,client,yeah
676,high_019,counsellor,straining the relationships with your friends
677,high_019,client,mm-hmm
678,high_019,counsellor,so the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you
679,high_019,client,No not at all
680,high_019,counsellor,but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it
681,high_019,client,yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change I'm making
682,high_019,counsellor,so you need to make some change
683,high_019,client,yeah
684,high_019,counsellor,but not the alcohol and drugs
685,high_019,client,yeah
686,high_019,counsellor,something else could change
687,high_019,client,yeah I don't know what
688,high_019,counsellor,you have any theories
689,high_019,client,I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's what like got me into this situation don't like other than that really and I really have really thought of what I could do
690,high_019,counsellor,so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain
691,high_019,client,I don't know it might just not go anywhere ever right not sure drive is often
692,high_019,counsellor,mmm
693,high_019,client,because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel okay
694,high_019,counsellor,hmm so that strategy might not work
695,high_019,client,I guess not
696,high_019,counsellor,that's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim
697,high_019,client,yeah
698,high_019,counsellor,is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you too
699,high_019,client,now that I'm like talking through it yeah and I don't think I have any choice really
700,high_019,counsellor,you don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen
701,high_019,client,I don't know
702,high_019,counsellor,all right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person
703,high_019,client,Um go to court wrong test positive if I get drug tested
704,high_019,counsellor,That would do it
705,high_019,client,I would do it get another DUI in the meantime
706,high_019,counsellor,that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things
707,high_019,client,I mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the nollie drunk-driving enough or maybe not to drank the day of my court date but I don't know about the whole you marijuana part
708,high_019,counsellor,that's tougher
709,high_019,client,yeah
710,high_019,counsellor,all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk
711,high_019,client,yeah
712,high_019,counsellor,goals that you could get behind
713,high_019,client,um I mean I can try I guess so like think about it and try to get out there I know I'm gonna be stressed out the day of my court dates it's gonna be hard to like not drink that day
714,high_019,counsellor,you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea
715,high_019,client,No I am not
716,high_019,counsellor,this is really tough for you the alcohol
717,high_019,client,um
718,high_019,counsellor,the marijuana that are important to you
719,high_019,client,yeah
720,high_019,counsellor,this whole DUI thing it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed
721,high_019,client,yeah
722,high_019,counsellor,so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things
723,high_019,client,Um I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it than just dealing with it. I mean if I like don't go to court or anything that's gonna warrant out for me. I can't I can't avoid this situation.
724,high_019,counsellor,what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail
725,high_019,client,I don't know if it would I get to that I know it possibly could that probably will but I I don't know
726,high_019,counsellor,I would think it almost certainly would have
727,high_019,client,yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day
728,high_019,counsellor,let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana
729,high_019,client,for about like six years
730,high_019,counsellor,six years have you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping
731,high_019,client,no
732,high_019,counsellor,what's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this
733,high_019,client,I just I did like the jerking kind of has gotten worse it wasn't always that bad. I've always used marijuana but the alcohol is I guess I've been using a little bit more recently. So I didn't really ever have a plan. The marijuana never really looked affected my life too much but I guess the alcohol has been a little bit more.
734,high_019,counsellor,yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come
735,high_019,client,yeah I didn't really have any like I never like thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or
736,high_019,counsellor,till now
737,high_019,client,yeah
738,high_019,counsellor,could this be in a strange way like an opportunity
739,high_019,client,I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or a reason for me to stop
740,high_019,counsellor,if you really wanted to stop could you stop
741,high_019,client,I don't know may I guess I could try but I don't have that one
742,high_019,counsellor,you could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it
743,high_019,client,yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know
744,high_019,counsellor,it's just unknown
745,high_019,client,yeah yeah
746,high_019,counsellor,so where do you want to go from here you have this DUI I imagine a hearing or some type coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you
747,high_019,client,um I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then
748,high_019,counsellor,like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality
749,high_019,client,yeah
750,high_019,counsellor,okay do you want to work on that
751,high_019,client,yeah
752,high_019,counsellor,all right so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up
753,high_019,client,no they're not for like a few more weeks
754,high_019,counsellor,a few more weeks so I'll see you again I know you have the IOP and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just snubby now

770,high_020,counsellor,okay
771,high_020,client,oh
772,high_020,counsellor,well I tell you what then before we get started in our session let's go through just a real quick breathing exercise just to kind of bring you into the here and now
773,high_020,client,okay
774,high_020,counsellor,you're not where you were an hour ago you have to worry about an hour from now that's just kind of right here okay can we do that we've done this a couple times in grooving in those practice it now it's sufficient being on the floor there we go put your hands on where you're comfortable you sitting up straight you've comfortable closing your eyes
775,high_020,client,yes
776,high_020,counsellor,yes all right so let's not clench your hands you go first thing you're going to do is take a nice deep breath and you're going to blow it out slowly through your lips just like you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake but very slow again to feel the air drove into you sensation on your lips your Grandpa's always your breath is there always there for you to remember that's better you're here and throw it say everything's good so let me ask you question yeah you gonna bring me something or find something
777,high_020,client,oh that's right oh I found something
778,high_020,counsellor,that you could touch your hole
779,high_020,client,oh that's beautiful
780,high_020,counsellor,okay so what do you what do you do with it
781,high_020,client,well this I mean I sometimes I put it just so I can feel it on the back of my neck sometimes I put it in my lap
782,high_020,counsellor,okay
783,high_020,client,you feel better just you know familiar things
784,high_020,counsellor,oh that's right so we'll go ahead and keep in your lap now you can touch it and help keep you singers and keep you here
785,high_020,client,okay
786,high_020,counsellor,so now that your little calmer let's talk about what happened with mom before you came here this afternoon
787,high_020,client,okay well I mean she knows that I'm looking for a job and she knows that I'm going to school and just every time I walk in the door she asks me to do the dishes no matter what and I just we get in a huge argument over well you've been home for two more hours and I've been home so why didn't you do the dishes or why didn't you start the dishes and and we scream at each other and I scream we have screaming matches I always try to scream louder than her and then she gets upset
788,high_020,counsellor,alright so it's back and forth in the situate a situation escalates and you slam doors and
789,high_020,client,we slam doors and stuff how do I get the impression
790,high_020,counsellor,okay well let's use this situation that has happened to you because today I wanted to actually work on awesome interpersonal would give them and I have a handout sheet to give you and it's called the give technique I want you to take a look at this handout you can take that home with you we're going to talk about this we can directly apply this to what happened today with your mom because this is going to happen again right same situation with your mom so it's a it's a an acronym give giv e why don't you read what those letters stand for
791,high_020,client,okay G gentle be gentle I interested act act interested the validate e easy manner use amazing manners
792,high_020,counsellor,okay so this is just something that when a situation starts to escalate you can just say give
793,high_020,client,okay
794,high_020,counsellor,gentle the interested validate and use an easy manner folks it's something it's really short and quick so in your situation with your mother when she started yelling at you about doing stuff if you thought okay G how would that look
795,high_020,client,G gentle um like it not yellow I could be quieter
796,high_020,counsellor,okay maybe your tone of voice so if you thought gentle that would probably stop in your tone of your voice a little bit and that would be a good response
797,high_020,client,okay
798,high_020,counsellor,okay that's very good good what about act interested
799,high_020,client,I'm going to make eye contact with her
800,high_020,counsellor,okay that's important so she knows that you're listening
801,high_020,client,the intention that you're paying attention
802,high_020,counsellor,right okay that would be something that you could do quickly and easily okay and what about validate it's an interesting word what what might that how might you validate what your mother is saying
803,high_020,client,I'm I can tell her that I understand that she would like me to help out around the house
804,high_020,counsellor,yes because you know what if you live together is it important that you work together and get everything done nobody likes to do housework but you all have to do it so does she have a good point
805,high_020,client,yeah
806,high_020,counsellor,can you validate what she's saying that you do hear what she's saying it's important that you do these things and you know I know that you have a lot on your plate certainly your mother notion have a lot on your plate Taylor right
807,high_020,client,okay
808,high_020,counsellor,you're dealing with a lot so but you can still validate her concerns -
809,high_020,client,okay
810,high_020,counsellor,in an easy manner what would that look like for you
811,high_020,client,um I I mean I kind of aggressive so I guess that could be you know I tried be more light-hearted about the situation if we start getting in arguments like it if we try to tell a joke there's no way I was like and
812,high_020,counsellor,they kind of difficult to tell a joke in the middle of a heated situation its Butthead but
813,high_020,client,yeah
814,high_020,counsellor,you could you could slow down
815,high_020,client,okay
816,high_020,counsellor,slow down and maybe stay calm and just think that think of the letter e easy whatever that that word easy would make you feel
817,high_020,client,okay
818,high_020,counsellor,so what are the three what the four letters again
819,high_020,client,G I
820,high_020,counsellor,G for
821,high_020,client,gentle interested validate easy
822,high_020,counsellor,easy okay good good good good so you're going to take that home and you're going to look that over all right okay put that go ahead and put that it
823,high_020,client,yeah
824,high_020,counsellor,in your workbook so it's a it's a really easy acronym to remember
825,high_020,client,"Speaking of acronym, I used the STOP technique that you taught me."
826,high_020,counsellor,you did yeah I want to hear about
827,high_020,client,the other day
828,high_020,counsellor,oh happy
829,high_020,client,yep the other day I was in traffic and I was getting on the highway and nobody was letting me in you know everybody was cutting me off I was getting so nervous and anxious because I couldn't get on the highway and then what was going to happen if I couldn't get on the highway and I am with a panic attack
830,high_020,counsellor,oh
831,high_020,client,and I calmed myself down I stopped
832,high_020,counsellor,stopped is the
833,high_020,client,S
834,high_020,counsellor,yeah
835,high_020,client,I stopped I took a breath
836,high_020,counsellor,T you took it breath and kind of like took a step back okay
837,high_020,client,observe my observe situation I said if I can't get on my Highway I'll just get off I'll get off and then I can get right back on and then P I proceeded with driving
838,high_020,counsellor,oh well I'm so I'm thrilled I'm so happy and it was quick and easy to remember
839,high_020,client,yes yes
840,high_020,counsellor,how did I make you feel to be able to change a behavior like that because ordinarily you would have been cursing and having that anxiety attack
841,high_020,client,right I was trying not to do all those things so I thought you know it to stop I just have to it kind of took me over I took it changed my focus and I had that to focus on so I didn't actually stop in the middle the highway but I you know
842,high_020,counsellor,"I am so proud of you. That is awesome. Taylor, I think I am just... I couldn't be happier. Wait till we tell the group."
843,high_020,client,oh yeah
844,high_020,counsellor,that is no good that would be so good so one more thing I want to give you today one more tool of your little toolkit it's called the opposites and it actually it's in your workbook if you look on page 233 got it if I know anger is one of your emotions that we're working on when I'm is one of our targets here and this has to do with the opposites and you can actually use some of these opposites when you're doing the give technique or when you're doing the stop technique and what it is is that whatever it is that you ordinarily do in response to situations how you react you do the opposite
845,high_020,client,ok
846,high_020,counsellor,so we're going to practice this we're going to practice more a group but I want you to kind of get an idea of what it is today so let me ask you a question when you feel angry what do you usually do with your hands
847,high_020,client,yes
848,high_020,counsellor,yeah kind of tight balled up tan
849,high_020,client,right
850,high_020,counsellor,so what would be the opposite of that
851,high_020,client,out to anyone
852,high_020,counsellor,relax we laugh okay so that would be the opposite of that okay so when you feel like going like that okay or or just keep your hands
853,high_020,client,open
854,high_020,counsellor,okay all right let's see what says your stomach muscles in your chest when you're angry what does that feel like
855,high_020,client,usual it kind of punched over tight i hunched over
856,high_020,counsellor,so if you want to do the absolute opposite of that what would that look like
857,high_020,client,sitting up straight stomach relaxed like I'm taking a deep breath
858,high_020,counsellor,deep breath deep exactly it's hard to take a deep breath when you're like that
859,high_020,client,okay
860,high_020,counsellor,good that's good good good okay what about your face what if what happens when you're angry you're G you're
861,high_020,client,I clench my teeth
862,high_020,counsellor,you can let your two together and you know Brown in and tight so what would be the opposite of that
863,high_020,client,relaxed thanks maybe a little
864,high_020,counsellor,maybe a little smile two little eyes you're up to it nothing fake but this is all meant to be behaviors that you do on purpose so maybe you feel yourself like this you can do it all at once
865,high_020,client,okay
866,high_020,counsellor,and that's something you can choose so got a lot here that you're in your little toolkit for one session so I want you to add this to your homework list
867,high_020,client,okay
868,high_020,counsellor,go ahead and write this down
869,high_020,client,okay
870,high_020,counsellor,"I want you this week to make a list in your journal of the times that you've used your stock technique. You've already used it once, so go ahead and you can put that. That could be your first entry."
871,high_020,client,okay
872,high_020,counsellor,when you used your gift technique
873,high_020,client,hmm
874,high_020,counsellor,and when you use the opposites of a happening and what I want you to do is first put what preceded what that was happening before you decided to use it for this technique so whether it was an argument your mother or somebody cut you off you know you're getting stressed about a homework assignment whatever happens to be what happened before which behavior you choose to use which skill set you're going to implement and then how do you sell afterwards okay and it made you feel calmer happier got along better with your mother you were able to finish your assignment without anxiety that whatever that happened to be
875,high_020,client,okay

898,high_021,counsellor,very cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun
899,high_021,client,um you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that
900,high_021,counsellor,it's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family
901,high_021,client,uh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog
902,high_021,counsellor,cute what kind of dogs
903,high_021,client,the golden retriever
904,high_021,counsellor,oh nice
905,high_021,client,I'm a big boy
906,high_021,counsellor,very fun all right and how are things going in school for you
907,high_021,client,pretty good grades have been pretty all right still like 3.7 ish
908,high_021,counsellor,okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school
909,high_021,client,I'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come a psychiatrist or something
910,high_021,counsellor,okay you have some pretty big dreams
911,high_021,client,yeah
912,high_021,counsellor,it's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life
913,high_021,client,um I think a sense of community and belonging
914,high_021,counsellor,okay
915,high_021,client,I think those two and um respect respect
916,high_021,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three
917,high_021,client,yeah well I think the community belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching band I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal
918,high_021,counsellor,mm-hmm
919,high_021,client,and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so
920,high_021,counsellor,okay
921,high_021,client,I place great importance in that
922,high_021,counsellor,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends
923,high_021,client,um sometimes if you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said or sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out
924,high_021,counsellor,mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved
925,high_021,client,yeah sometimes
926,high_021,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene
927,high_021,client,uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and got everything loosened up as they say
928,high_021,counsellor,mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking
929,high_021,client,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance I'd say about like two weekends out of the month two three
930,high_021,counsellor,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink
931,high_021,client,the days that we drink are mostly like I said they're parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching a movie it's not yeah
932,high_021,counsellor,so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get
933,high_021,client,definitely
934,high_021,counsellor,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games
935,high_021,client,I think of them as as different. I think you know like in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather. Versus with a party it's a lot more energetic. It's a after at all it's very draining.
936,high_021,counsellor,mm-hmm
937,high_021,client,but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have
938,high_021,counsellor,okay so there's sort of pros and cons
939,high_021,client,oh yeah
940,high_021,counsellor,okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol
941,high_021,client,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad
942,high_021,counsellor,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol
943,high_021,client,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that we we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleepover friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid
944,high_021,counsellor,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening
945,high_021,client,sometimes yeah
946,high_021,counsellor,can you tell me a little bit about that
947,high_021,client,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we hadn't up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun
948,high_021,counsellor,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened
949,high_021,client,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me and that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do sometimes so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and
950,high_021,counsellor,okay
951,high_021,client,it kind of put it down around my my fun
952,high_021,counsellor,huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol
953,high_021,client,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff
954,high_021,counsellor,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy
955,high_021,client,yeah
956,high_021,counsellor,got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions
957,high_021,client,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things. I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or someone's parents home or something. But so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun.
958,high_021,counsellor,okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then
959,high_021,client,it sort of defeats the purpose
960,high_021,counsellor,right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that
961,high_021,client,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there but in terms of hot ways I am respecting myself I am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met in - I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that
962,high_021,counsellor,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or
963,high_021,client,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you know get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and I'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cup some people aren't going to be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and I'll still be you know having some to like let loose a little
964,high_021,counsellor,mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think
965,high_021,client,for the most part it works pretty well because like I said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have so I'm like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into
966,high_021,counsellor,okay
967,high_021,client,too much
968,high_021,counsellor,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like
969,high_021,client,I'd
970,high_021,counsellor,like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself
971,high_021,client,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less
972,high_021,counsellor,okay like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22 mm-hmm
973,high_021,client,and um you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community
974,high_021,counsellor,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now
975,high_021,client,I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't
976,high_021,counsellor,uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four
977,high_021,client,um because I still think it's it's important
978,high_021,counsellor,uh-huh
979,high_021,client,I still you know like I said I don't want my body tried specially going to my school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social and your schoolwork and things like that. I know that once I get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam. I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea.
980,high_021,counsellor,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to
981,high_021,client,I think
982,high_021,counsellor,on that same scale from one to ten
983,high_021,client,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a ten. I know I
984,high_021,counsellor,oh wow okay why did you say ten
985,high_021,client,it's just because I know that once I make the decision I know I can making the decision in the first place okay weather
986,high_021,counsellor,okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that
987,high_021,client,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking me not drinking and them doing whatever they want
988,high_021,counsellor,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or
989,high_021,client,I think so I think it's it's very feasible I think it's possible
990,high_021,counsellor,okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going
991,high_021,client,I think so that's good
992,high_021,counsellor,does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going
993,high_021,client,I'd like to
994,high_021,counsellor,alright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks
995,high_021,client,Thanks
996,high_023,counsellor,well let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself
997,high_023,client,I'm pretty obvious
998,high_023,counsellor,so what happened first of all tell me what you did exactly
999,high_023,client,what you mean what I did
1000,high_023,counsellor,well I mean where'd you cut yourself I know you said you cut yourself with a name as always same as always
1001,high_023,client,or your arm
1002,high_023,counsellor,yeah
1003,high_023,client,where'd you get your stuff left and right there hug it
1004,high_023,counsellor,want to see it
1005,high_023,client,yeah
1006,high_023,counsellor,can you say hey you can oh those look to me like they they did you go does it it doesn't look like you went and got any stitches but that looks to me like you could have used them what do you think
1007,high_023,client,I think have you ever been to it er when you cut yourself even though I don't go
1008,high_023,counsellor,okay part of the problem is those look deep in like you're going to have significant force so my suggestion is in the future if you do is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed now let's talk about how how this happened list of all tell me you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die but did you assist a suicide attempt or do things just to cutting your thinking about killing yourself of wanting to kill yourself of wanting to die and again
1009,high_023,client,thinking about killing myself you thought you would help me and you didn't that's what I want to talk about I want to talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me and you are not available to me when I need help okay
1010,high_023,counsellor,so let's okay so it sounds like me not being a bit with me not being available if you rate related to you cutting yourself
1011,high_023,client,I cut myself the first time to call you thinking you would help me you wouldn't help me so then I figured what the hell I might as well just go all the way and so that's why I cut myself deep
1012,high_024,counsellor,what do you feel about the possibility of doing some of that thinking and looking in with another person I hear you clearly saying I don't need you know help I don't need therapy I don't need treatment of any kind but I'm thinking about the exploration area of that and whether or not you have thoughts on how helpful it might be to sit down and be able to sort of chat with somebody about the connection between the alcohol issue and the anger issue and coming back from the war issue and that kind of thing
1013,high_024,client,i'd be willing to explore it like I said I think I can handle these issues on my own
1014,high_024,counsellor,so here feeling kind of two ways but I kind of feel like to get it on my own but on the other hand I would be willing to talk to somebody
1015,high_024,client,right
1016,high_024,counsellor,such as my girlfriend wants me to do and it sounds like there's some reasons that you've got for doing that one of which is a relationship can you think of other reasons that would support the notion of just coming into to chat again and down the road
1017,high_024,client,well I don't like where my anger is at I do not like that if talking to you someone like yourself would would help in those areas and not be willing to do that
1018,high_024,counsellor,so the one thing that you and your girlfriend Sharon color is that you want change with respect to this anger issue of the
1019,high_024,client,anger issue
1020,high_024,counsellor,and it sounds like it needs to change
1021,high_024,client,it's just not healthy
1022,high_024,counsellor,yeah gotcha so I wonder if I can move that then to this whole issue of commandment I hear you saying pretty loud and clear I am committed to the relationship I will do what it takes and maybe I would be willing to the level of six to come in and chat with somebody about it down the road would it be help for me to to offer you sort of a smorgasbord or a menu of what we have to offer here and see if any of those view at all
1023,high_024,client,sure
1024,high_025,counsellor,hi Josh great to see you how's everything going with you
1025,high_025,client,yeah fine thanks
1026,high_025,counsellor,great okay so before we get started are there any changes to your medical history such as any new medications you might be taking or any serious operation since the last time I saw you
1027,high_025,client,no not that I can think of
1028,high_025,counsellor,anything worrying you about your teeth or gums
1029,high_025,client,no not really
1030,high_025,counsellor,okay so what would you like me to do for you today would you like me to simply do a check-up let you know what I find and perhaps help you have a healthy mouth
1031,high_025,client,yeah checkup sounds good
1032,high_025,counsellor,Sure okay let's lie you back. Very some became one of your lower molars. Unfortunately Josh it does look like you're going to need a filling. I would like to try to help you so we can determine just how you got this new hole. May I ask you a few questions so we can avoid it from happening in the future?
1033,high_025,client,can't you just put a filling in it and just fix it
1034,high_025,counsellor,it sounds like you're keen to get healthy I like your practical attitude the new filling will fix this hole but it won't stop new holes from occurring as I said I really would like to try to help you so we can avoid you having to get any fillings in the future on that note would be really great to try to get to know what you've been eating and drinking
1035,high_025,client,look I know I've got a real sweet tooth I don't need you to talk to me about that
1036,high_025,counsellor,you obviously know yourself pretty well thanks for these helpful information
1037,high_025,client,I know it's bad for my teeth can we just get this feeling done
1038,high_025,counsellor,you're right that it's bad for your teeth should I possibly give you any more information
1039,high_025,client,yes sure
1040,high_025,counsellor,the bacteria actually use the sugar that's in your mouth to create acids and it's these acids that eat through the tooth surfaces to cause holes so you could say the more the teeth are coated in sugar the more likely it is that you're going to get holes if we're able to chat a little bit more about your diet I might be able to help you so that we can reduce the risk of you needing fillings in the future
1041,high_025,client,or anyone I chat about my diet right now can we just get this feeling done
1042,high_025,counsellor,okay it sounds like you're not ready to chat about this today is that okay with you if we have this conversation at some point in the future

1048,high_026,client,well a friend and I we snuck out one night to go to the park and we got a couple beers from his house but a cop came by so we threw him in the bushes he was originally gonna give us a curfew ticket but ended up not luckily he didn't see the beer
1049,high_026,counsellor,that must have be real scary
1050,high_026,client,yeah it was if my mom would have found out she would have killed me
1051,high_026,counsellor,I understand so tell me how often do you drink
1052,high_026,client,well I've only tried drinking once or twice
1053,high_026,counsellor,let me make sure I understand you have tried drinking a couple times and you almost got in trouble once did I get that right
1054,high_026,client,yeah that's it

1056,high_026,client,well I'm not sure if this information is for me since I've only been drinking once or twice
1057,high_026,counsellor,I understand you're just experimenting with alcohol then how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are
1058,high_026,client,well all I really know is that it's not good for you
1059,high_026,counsellor,are you surprised what that might be true
1060,high_026,client,yeah and a couple of my friends drink too
1061,high_026,counsellor,well you might not be drinking that much and other kids are also trying alcohol I like to share with you the risk of using alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain still changing it also you're very a hydrous for becoming addicted alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals especially in sports and it could cause on attendants sex how do you feel about this information
1062,high_026,client,I really didn't think about how this would affect me playing sports
1063,high_026,counsellor,"Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really want to play soccer. You have great goals about that."
1064,high_026,client,yeah I would like to play soccer in college
1065,high_026,counsellor,that's a great goal to have for yourself
1066,high_026,client,yeah I would also like to get scholarships
1067,high_026,counsellor,this scholarship will really help you achieving your goals
1068,high_026,client,yeah
1069,high_026,counsellor,I would like to share with you this materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about this risk. What do you think about that?
1070,high_026,client,well I will take a look at it and I'll definitely read it and I don't want to become addicted I would like to continue to play sports as long as possible
1071,high_026,counsellor,it sounds like you're in the right track looks like you care about your health and you care about your goals in life I'm here to answer any questions
1072,high_026,client,thanks for all the information
1073,high_026,counsellor,your work
1074,high_027,counsellor,okay Tamra so I just finished reevaluate your gums
1075,high_027,client,yeah
1076,high_027,counsellor,and we did your scaling and root planing just a few weeks ago
1077,high_027,client,uh-huh
1078,high_027,counsellor,and I wanted to let you know that we didn't get the response that we were looking for
1079,high_027,client,Oh No
1080,high_027,counsellor,"so I wanted to ask you on a scale from one to ten, ten being the best, one being the worst, how important is it to you"
1081,high_027,client,about four or five
1082,high_027,counsellor,okay what do you think it would take to move you to a seven or an eight
1083,high_027,client,maybe some more information because you know I'm newly diabetic so I'm just learning you know my diet and taking my medicine and stuff and sometimes I forget to take my medicine but you know maybe if you could help me with that
1084,high_027,counsellor,okay so tell me what you know about the relationship between diabetes and gum disease
1085,high_027,client,I know that it you know it kind of goes together but I'm not really sure anything else about it
1086,high_027,counsellor,that's true that's true that's good the relationship between your gums and your diabetes if your diabetes is not well controlled it's not it's not a good thing your gums tissues tend to be more irritated they believe much more easily your gum disease progresses much quicker and how long has it been since you've seen your doctor
1087,high_027,client,my Sultan last week and he took like work and then he called me back and he said that my number was like 7.5 and it's not really where he wanted me to be at but he said since I was so new that you know I just still needed to work on my diet and taking the medicine we need to give it a little bit longer and see if that won't help
1088,high_027,counsellor,okay good sounds like you're really motivated and you're doing some research and kind of staying on top of it that's you know trying
1089,high_027,client,I'm trying to get the diet down
1090,high_027,counsellor,good
1091,high_027,client,that's a little bit different
1092,high_027,counsellor,good what would you say is your biggest challenge for keeping it well controlled
1093,high_027,client,I'm probably taking my medicine because I forget a lot of times you know I just I don't really take any other medicines and that's the you know and I need to take it every day he said so sometimes I do forget so that that could be it
1094,high_027,counsellor,okay well I have a couple of suggestions and I think what help is that okay
1095,high_027,client,yeah
1096,high_027,counsellor,okay the first thing I think would be a good idea would be that you put your medication near your toothbrush
1097,high_027,client,that would work yeah because you're taking it at night
1098,high_027,counsellor,right right
1099,high_027,client,and it's metformin
1100,high_027,counsellor,right
1101,high_027,client,okay so if you put your toothbrush and your medication side by side then you would be brushing your teeth at night before you go to bed which is very important yes and then you can take your medication and you'd be less likely to forget
1102,high_027,counsellor,that's right that would I mean that would work
1103,high_027,client,okay good so now tell me with the information I've given you today how would you say what would you say be a 1 or a 10 in regards to taking better care of your gums where would you be
1104,high_027,counsellor,I don't probably I need to be you know more like a seven or eight because it is really affecting you know my cleaning and everything if I don't take my medicine and don't you know get my diabetes under control
1105,high_027,client,well good I think we have a plan and I think we're gonna see better results next thank you
1106,high_028,counsellor,Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol on the contraception
1107,high_028,client,sure
1108,high_028,counsellor,okay so we're working on a 10-point scale of one to ten one being not important can be very important one being not confident one being very confident so on a scale of one to ten which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the low risk lips
1109,high_028,client,I would say eight
1110,high_028,counsellor,you'd say I'm eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels
1111,high_028,client,I would say a four
1112,high_028,counsellor,amount of four okay and so let's look at those two here you're thinking that's pretty important but your confidence is down here a four but it's not a one what makes you confident that you can drink the low risk levels and you remember what those are
1113,high_028,client,I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path so I'm confident that I can change that at this point
1114,high_028,counsellor,okay so that gives you a good reason not to drink okay anything else
1115,high_028,client,well I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with and I think what I hang out with them it's an issue so that also helps me
1116,high_028,counsellor,so you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink
1117,high_028,client,yeah
1118,high_028,counsellor,below risk levels
1119,high_028,client,yep
1120,high_028,counsellor,okay anything else
1121,high_028,client,nope
1122,high_028,counsellor,now let's look at your self evaluation of your birth-control views so now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control so on a scale of one to ten how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant
1123,high_028,client,I would say an eight
1124,high_028,counsellor,an eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time to you that you can use effective birth control
1125,high_028,client,every time
1126,high_028,counsellor,every time
1127,high_028,client,you are sick
1128,high_028,counsellor,correctly as its prescribed at
1129,high_028,client,probably six
1130,high_028,counsellor,probably a six okay so you're pretty confident that you can do it and why are you a six and not a two or a three
1131,high_028,client,I'm a six because I think if I drink less I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm I drank too much and I don't really care too much.
1132,high_028,counsellor,okay so it's kind of linked to your drinking the fact that that you can if you can take care of that drinking you can take care of the birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here
1133,high_028,client,yes
1134,high_028,counsellor,"Very good, so it looks like you're using a good method of birth control. You're just not able to use it effectively and you've linked it back to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use of this today?"
1135,high_028,client,before I leave
1136,high_028,counsellor,yes
1137,high_028,client,okay
1138,high_028,counsellor,okay and if you need more information we can get that for you
1139,high_028,client,okay
1140,high_028,counsellor,okay
1141,high_029,counsellor,hi mr. snow
1142,high_029,client,hey
1143,high_029,counsellor,how are you doing today I'm Bruce Berger I work on the case manager with your health plan I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes
1144,high_029,client,yeah I'm supposed to learn how to manage it I just learned that I got diabetes and apparently it's pretty bad because she said my blood sugar was sky-high and she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen that just sounds so disastrous and then she told me I've got to do all this stuff man it's just source disappointment right now so you just you just saw the doctor and you know you sound like you just got blindsided with not only how how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that she you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen on your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things actually
1145,high_029,counsellor,my legs having troubles and
1146,high_029,client,so you're really kind of reeling right now from all of that and saying you sound a little bit pretty pretty scared actually
1147,high_029,counsellor,well that's yeah it's not just being scared you know I don't want that to happen to me but then one when when she reels off all these things I got to do and I'm sort of you know I'm not certain I can even get it done so it's sort of simple you know I'm sitting here thinking that oh my god this is this is what's going to happen to me as a discourage yes so a slight discard it sounds a lot like on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control and I can't imagine doing all those things so you almost feel like all that bad stuff is going to happen
1148,high_029,client,yeah it looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle and yeah all this horrible stuff happens to me I mean it's it's a relief looking situation
1149,high_029,counsellor,okay and I and what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down on you know on the one hand you're doctors right you know your blood sugar is very high and we do want to get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen and and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to to get your blood sugar down you know on the other hand we can take this a step at a time so it's not so overwhelming and I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now you know for example there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes taking your medicine as prescribed and honestly if I was going to work on one thing right away given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that do that first because that'll have the biggest impact how does that sound so far
1150,high_029,client,well I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines especially since I understand what blood Sugar's really high
1151,high_029,counsellor,so that sounds doable
1152,high_029,client,yeah I'm pretty good yeah
1153,high_029,counsellor,because it looks like you need to just take your medicine once a day from the prescription so that sounds doable right now
1154,high_029,client,yeah I think I could probably do that
1155,high_029,counsellor,okay the other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits you know to eat healthier not necessarily less but healthier and the other thing would be getting some more physical activity and by the way that doesn't mean going to a gym that means things like more walking maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or escalator stuff like that
1156,high_029,client,well she also mentioned the monitoring my blood sugar and all this and that just seemed like them mm-hmm a lot of and that's mumbo jumbo to me yeah
1157,high_029,counsellor,that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task
1158,high_029,client,oh okay
1159,high_029,counsellor,so it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine when you're changing your eating habits that it's really having an impact than your blood sugar because getting your blood sugar down is gonna keep you from having all those other problems how does all this where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling
1160,high_029,client,well I like it that I you know that we can do it as stuff at the time I mean that's that relieves some pressure and being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than I I wasn't certain I could just wait and put this huge programming into effect but doing a step at a time and I you know that getting on the medicine I don't think that's any big problem like that I couldn't do
1161,high_029,counsellor,sounds like you're very committed to that
1162,high_029,client,yeah I think I could do that as long as there's no big time side effects
1163,high_030,counsellor,great hello my name is Sara I'm the student pharmacist at what's a name and how can I help you
1164,high_030,client,you can comment miss trans I'm just having like a migraine today so I'm coming in hopefully you can make any recommendation for me I choke fatigue cold and tired
1165,high_030,counsellor,all right when a scale one to ten how bad is your headache
1166,high_030,client,it's about seven
1167,high_030,counsellor,oh I see you and a lot of pain right now
1168,high_030,client,yeah
1169,high_030,counsellor,when did it start
1170,high_030,client,um it start a couple of hours ago and it's it's getting worse
1171,high_030,counsellor,did you take any medications yet
1172,high_030,client,um no not not at all not at all
1173,high_030,counsellor,so what makes it better and what makes it worse
1174,high_030,client,"so if I'm exposed to loud noise and then light I tend to get worse but then if I, you know, go into a dark room without noise, it's getting better but still I'm still having like a, you know, really bad migraine"
1175,high_030,counsellor,dude they do again those migraines select orphan
1176,high_030,client,um only once once in a while is very rare I'm not really often at all
1177,high_030,counsellor,okay so before I recommend that medications to be and before I will I want you to ask you about your past medical history
1178,high_030,client,okay
1179,high_030,counsellor,do you take any medications or do you have any medical conditions
1180,high_030,client,I I have diabetes so I'm currently taking metformin twice daily other than that I don't think I take any other medications at all alright
1181,high_030,counsellor,alright do you smoke
1182,high_030,client,um I don't
1183,high_030,counsellor,do you drink alcohol
1184,high_030,client,occasionally
1185,high_030,counsellor,occasionally how much
1186,high_030,client,drink one drink like maybe what
1187,high_030,counsellor,it's all right
1188,high_030,client,yeah
1189,high_030,counsellor,no that's all right there's any allergies
1190,high_030,client,not that I know no
1191,high_030,counsellor,okay so I will recommend medication this one it's called excedrin extra strength it has if the one tablet contains three different medications inside first one is acetaminophen it's a pain reliever and the second one is aspirin it's a pain reliever and it's also anti-inflammatory drug and also it contains caffeine
1192,high_030,client,okay
1193,high_030,counsellor,and caffeine scanners constrict your blood vessels in your brain and also can relieve pain from from the migraine
1194,high_030,client,okay
1195,high_030,counsellor,all right so this medication because of your your headache is very bad I would recommend you to take two terabytes
1196,high_030,client,okay
1197,high_030,counsellor,by mouth every six hours but not more than eight tablets a day I say and you should not be taking this medication for more than 72 hours not more than three days and if you still feel the symptoms they're handing now after three days you should consult your doctor
1198,high_030,client,okay
1199,high_030,counsellor,all right
1200,high_030,client,okay
1201,high_030,counsellor,and the best way to take this medication is with water
1202,high_030,client,okay
1203,high_030,counsellor,with a full glass of water and if you feel upset stomach you should take it with meals
1204,high_030,client,okay
1205,high_030,counsellor,food okay
1206,high_030,client,okay
1207,high_030,counsellor,usually this medication does not cause any major side effects however it make was obsessed Omikron or vomiting and you may feel a little bit nervous of shaking
1208,high_030,client,okay
1209,high_030,counsellor,because of caffeine all right and then I would advise you not to drink any alcohol tourist medication because it may increase your risk for a stomach bleeding or a liver disease all right and you should not be taking any other medications over-the-counter like Tylenol or ibuprofen advil that personally don't take any of this because it already contains no aspirin okay because it contains a renter those products so you should not be taking too much of it and I would also advise you not to have too much coffee or caffeine in general
1210,high_030,client,okay
1211,high_030,counsellor,all right because this product contains caffeine inside
1212,high_030,client,okay
1213,high_030,counsellor,all right and also this medication does not have any drug interactions with your metformin so don't worry affect that's what I am concerned okay and you know so how so do we have any questions for me
1214,high_030,client,um so so I just take two tablets every six hours for the cost of water
1215,high_030,counsellor,all right
1216,high_030,client,perfect thanks so much
1217,high_030,counsellor,oh yeah oh you're welcome so you need any more help any questions you can always find me here
1218,high_030,client,okay perfect thank you
1219,high_031,client,many people have told me if I quit smoking I'm gonna gain weight well food really doesn't taste good but they say it tastes much better if you quit smoking
1220,high_031,counsellor,mm-hmm
1221,high_031,client,now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight
1222,high_031,counsellor,mm-hmm
1223,high_031,client,that means a new wardrobe which I'd like to have but I can't afford
1224,high_031,counsellor,so right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life it's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years it's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then
1225,high_031,client,yeah
1226,high_031,counsellor,and your worry is that if you stop you will end up gaining weight so I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping I'm wondering what else might be on that list
1227,high_031,client,withdrawal hmm they say it's awful being cranky
1228,high_031,counsellor,mm-hmm
1229,high_031,client,and if I do go through this I just hope my friends understand and will support me and what I'm trying to do
1230,high_031,counsellor,mm-hmm okay yeah so added to the other other list is they're having to go through the withdrawal the unpleasantness of that
1231,high_031,client,okay
1232,high_031,counsellor,what else might be on the not-so-good side about smoking and that's talking
1233,high_031,client,um I think everything's on the bad sad about smoking but I'm just smoked so long I just can't imagine not going through life without smoking I know I've got to stop I'm having no health problems from cigarettes
1234,high_031,counsellor,mm-hmm
1235,high_031,client,at present but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future
1236,high_031,counsellor,mm-hmm
1237,high_031,client,that made me rethink everything
1238,high_032,counsellor,so brings you here today well my doctor made me come said of my diet is bad and my cholesterol level is up so high that I've got to change the way I eat and honestly I don't really feel like doing that so he said I had to come talk to you and hopes that that's going to help
1239,high_032,client,ok so what's nothing to me is that your doctor saying you have an issue a health issue at your cholesterol and nearly an allison issue of this present time cycle right
1240,high_032,counsellor,right it was actually I feel pretty good they do a test on me and says mom not healthy because what I eat them I don't know it doesn't bother me
1241,high_032,client,ok so you found a little we're very resistant to change
1242,high_032,counsellor,I like french fries I like fast food I don't want of time to cook you know this is the food I eat his burgers it's what's my lifestyle and he says I got to stop eating french fries sometimes pizza I like sausage and a breakfast I eat almost the whole pound of bacon log bacon bacon on my eggs bacon on the sandwiches I like bacon on the cheeseburgers the doctors like Mr. Hendricks you have to stop eating bacon wait a minute I don't know about that french fries
1243,high_032,client,so this is the first time you went to the doctor he makes an account with your high cholesterol okay so how long it's been going on for a while I mean every time he was like yeah I think you how to change the way ye na ma alright and then I keep eating it the this time he's dropped the heavy on me and he said you're gonna have to do this and he showed me pictures of cholesterol problems and told me facts and stories about people that's didn't stop eating the bad foods and cholesterol levels where they ended up not so I don't want to die
1244,high_032,counsellor,okay so what do you think to do to help resolve the issue
1245,high_032,client,I'm kind of hoping some other options I'm changing my food
1246,high_032,counsellor,have you considered exercise
1247,high_032,client,we didn't talk so much about that he was so focused on the food but I'd be willing to exercise if I can still eat my fries
1248,high_032,counsellor,"Okay, will sound like you have it this semester issue the food thing. You are not great to give up but exercising to be a possible Avenue just to lower your cholesterol levels. Ok, so how motivated are you today start like a rigorous exercise 18 the lord I kept glycerol."
1249,high_032,client,was six maybe a seven even
1250,high_032,counsellor,okay so what could you do this week to start now once you've in this office today to have lower your cholesterol
1251,high_032,client,follow the hunger but how odd probably willing to talk to somebody about an exercise program
1252,high_032,counsellor,okay have you know participant I can exercise over the floor
1253,high_032,client,no
1254,high_032,counsellor,ya knows me a lot of work and I respect your decision that you are not ready to give the food but you have a decision to make good choices it is your choice to do with you is it D but this is too much for you like you're incapable of this this is beyond you you can now show your dad
1255,high_032,client,I can do it but I don't know if I'd be happy
1256,high_032,counsellor,so how would you know if you're not happy until you try it
1257,high_032,client,I got a feeling I wouldn't be happy but I'm wrong
1258,high_032,counsellor,okay so you say motivated like a 6 or a 7
1259,high_032,client,mm
1260,high_032,counsellor,is that the highest like today that you've been or wish your motivation I'm lowering operators after my last doctor appointment
1261,high_032,client,okay it is promised been going on for how many watts or yeah probably three to four years
1262,high_032,counsellor,three or four years okay
1263,high_032,client,he's noticed it's been a while since my cholesterol hasn't started to come down
1264,high_032,counsellor,okay so this is like neglect for the three or four years
1265,high_032,client,pretty much
1266,high_032,counsellor,but you are little motivated now
1267,high_032,client,yeah he scared me all about with the health reports he was giving me okay where's next time he goes to the doctor
1268,high_032,counsellor,he wants me back in a month
1269,high_032,client,okay so cuz you're a little motivated he said I'm six or seven we can maybe establish a plan for you so we listen good a doctor your clothes will be lower than what it was just this present month
1270,high_032,counsellor,that'd be good
1271,high_032,client,sorry the plan
1272,high_032,counsellor,sorry your plan
1273,high_033,counsellor,good morning Linda my name is Ann and I'll be your next to do yeah we have about 15 minutes where we could talk I want you to know that whatever information you give me will be kept confidential I'm only going to inform the health care team if needed yeah I actually am happy and respect the fact that you took of time off your busy schedule so come and see me today how are you feeling so what I think you are a little bit concerned right can you elaborate on that
1274,high_033,client,well unless you know I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I was still a suspect I'm finding it hard to find the time to do that so it's really taking it totally it's not easy
1275,high_033,counsellor,so what I'm hearing you say is it's really been hard it's really been difficult for you to exercise this data right yes
1276,high_033,client,that's true I actually tried a few plants earlier but it didn't work us blind soon it's not been easy for me to assess myself
1277,high_033,counsellor,so what you're saying is you tried some strategies in the past but it didn't work out as planned this well I want you to know that relapse is normal and changing a behavior it's also quite as difficult it takes time so do not be too hard on himself but I appreciate the fact that you actually do try and that is a good step you did actually take so why do you want to change
1278,high_033,client,well I want to exercise because I've been told they will help me control my sugar level and my uncle died of diabetes and I don't want that to happen to me
1279,high_033,counsellor,okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 there will be not important at all and 10 being very important how do you reach the level of importance of
1280,high_033,client,it's very important to me to exercise now so I'm sitting
1281,high_033,counsellor,okay great that's wonderful so that tells me that it's actually very important to you right okay then on a scale of zero to ten again there being not that confident on not having any confidence in yourself and ten being very confident in yourself how would you reach your confidence level for changing to start to exercise so that's also good but can you explain to me why it's actually not informative
1282,high_033,client,well the fact that I've tried before makes it more than before even though I feel and being able to talk to somebody to gives me some confidence also
1283,high_033,counsellor,okay okay so what do you think I've helped you move towards the -
1284,high_033,client,well I think I can come and see you for more advice and it will help me with my confidence
1285,high_033,counsellor,well so Linda what I'm hearing you say is that it's actually very important for you to exercise but on the other hand you are not that confident to actually start a success is that true
1286,high_033,client,that's very true
1287,high_033,counsellor,okay well so far I don't know a few things about you can you tell me how it typically is like for you
1288,high_033,client,mmm I'm a businesswoman I'm very busy most of the time I have three stores in that and I drove quite a distance together I mean usually in the first off I ate and I moved through the other stores intermittently but I do take ways
1289,high_033,counsellor,so what you're telling me is that on one hand you are very busy with your job but on the other hand you take place right and actually that's a good thing because we can actually capitalize upon taking your breaks have you ever thought of ways in which you could use your groups it's Eliza we've done
1290,high_033,client,a lot from eating I think I can go to there Jamie I actually thought of it luckily there's a gym by the second store so I plan to go there I work maybe every other day for now
1291,high_033,counsellor,oh great that's really wonderful to hear from you can I share a few thoughts with you
1292,high_033,client,sure
1293,high_033,counsellor,eyesight actually going to the gym or when you don't have the opportunity to go to the gym you can also use the stay keys instead of using the elevator
1294,high_033,client,oh my gosh
1295,high_033,counsellor,yeah that would also provide a means of being physically active okay what do you think
1296,high_033,client,that sounds good I could actually park my car maybe some distance from the shop and network that sounds good
1297,high_033,counsellor,okay so since I'm gonna see you back in two minutes in two weeks sorry I would like you to actually notes when you actually go to the gym and also when you use the staircase and bring it back write it down in your journal and would know the next step from there okay thank you
1298,high_034,counsellor,Jeffrey tell me what you'd like to talk about today
1299,high_034,client,um that's all you can call me Jeff that's fine um I don't know there's just so much going on right now hey I lost my job two months ago and I don't know I was like taking care of myself so much better and it's just I stopped going to church as much and it's been really tough because my wife and my two kids aren't living with you right now so I'm just trying to get my just kind of get trying to get myself together right now and so I mean you're the first person I've seen in four days I just don't know I just don't know what to do
1300,high_034,counsellor,okay so right now you have so much going on that you're just feeling totally overwhelmed you don't even know where to start
1301,high_034,client,yeah
1302,high_034,counsellor,thinking about trying to control your diabetes just seems like one more
1303,high_034,client,yeah I did likely from like a bottom of a job like how can I think about you know checking my sugar and irregular basis I'm trying to just get out of bed you know I'm not sleep till 2:00 p.m. like I've been doing
1304,high_034,counsellor,here you've been feeling a little bit depressed right now
1305,high_034,client,yeah yeah it's not hopeful
1306,high_034,counsellor,so it sounds like you mentioned that you had been going to church some like the people that you had
1307,high_034,client,that's part of what I'm scared about is you know what if they aren't there like one thing that was really cool is on Wednesdays me and a few my friends have walked the Bible study instead of driving and it was fun one of the friends was named Cheryl and whenever I didn't go she'd call up and be like so you know she's always getting me to go and just I didn't want to let them down I also really enjoyed it so we just talked about work I have a job now but I mean we just I don't know we just talked about life you know
1308,high_034,counsellor,yeah exactly yeah in two in two of them had diabetes as well so sometimes we were just Chad you know see you people were you know just taking care of themselves get into the clinic doing whatever they needed to do so
1309,high_034,client,yeah I just I just I don't know I just it's just it's just tough because you know not only do I miss my friends but I also miss being a good husband and being a dad and and being able to provide and just I mean I had to get food at the church food pantry you know two weeks ago and you know it shouldn't be like that I should be able to support them and to you know work hard go to or come home you know cook dinner help with the homework I mean I'm not doing any have no structure of our life right now you know I I mean I could sleep until 2 p.m. because who cares you know
1310,high_034,counsellor,it sounds a little bit like you're feeling a change that you can't fill this role that you
1311,high_034,client,it's not so much ashamed it's just embarrassed you know it's like I I I mean even just saying this I'm kind of like hope you know that you don't judge me or whatever because I did I can't even it's hard to even just say this I don't want things to be like this you know it's hard enough sometimes having diabetes and being embarrassed around that but throw all this other stuff on and it's too much I just don't even want to acknowledge it really you know
1312,high_034,counsellor,you're really frustrated because there's so many things going on in your life that you feel like you don't even have control
1313,high_034,client,exactly exactly yeah I mean at least I had control as far as going to work going to church taking care of my family I mean those are three things that helped having those in balance I could focus on my diabetes because it was as part of my routine and I got ready for work you know like that was just part of my routine
1314,high_034,counsellor,so in the past when you were able to have the structure and also the support of people around you it's sort of added more daily basis there's a lot easier
1315,high_034,client,yeah it wasn't easy but it along or I just felt like I could deal with it
1316,high_034,counsellor,okay so you know you're really overwhelmed right now and everything just sort of really it sounds like you may have identified a few things to think about in trying to figure out where to move forward I did work in the past
1317,high_034,client,right now some things work you're right
1318,high_034,counsellor,so having some social support having some structure
1319,high_034,client,yeah
1320,high_034,counsellor,those might be some areas to to think about
1321,high_034,client,yeah
1322,high_035,counsellor,hi Tom how are you today
1323,high_035,client,yeah going well thanks
1324,high_035,counsellor,so before we begin let's update your medical history it's important we're doing this at each time because your oral health can affect your general health and vice versa are you taking any new medication as a moment no if you had any major surgery or serious illness in the past six months no have no changes
1325,high_035,client,that's great were there any concerns today
1326,high_035,counsellor,yes I've been been in for a while but lately I've noticed these white spots appearing on my teeth they've sure that they're before
1327,high_035,client,ok shall we check them out. ok Tom so these white spots they're actually the first sign of decay. what I'd like to do is help you work how why you've develop our developing them in the first place. do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
1328,high_035,counsellor,yeah sure that's fine
1329,high_035,client,excellent so I might do that we might get you to do what's called a risk assessment form so it's just here
1330,high_035,counsellor,yep
1331,high_035,client,I'm just getting you to fill that one out for us
1332,high_035,counsellor,yep
1333,high_035,client,"Excellent, thank you. Says here that you're having one can of soft drink a day. But you're spending a bit of time drinking that."
1334,high_035,counsellor,yeah that's right um usually have it around lunchtime and I just slowly sip it throughout the afternoon that way I don't feel like having another can later I just have the one can
1335,high_035,client,that's great but you only went in here and take a soft drink Tom however it's also important how you drink it do you understand why sugar and acid are bad for your teeth
1336,high_035,counsellor,yeah see online all the time about how sugars really bad for your teeth so I try not to eat like lollies and other stuff like that too much
1337,high_035,client,that's great that you're trying to you know limit your intake of sugar and all is it definitely not a too friendly food the issue is sugar is that it feeds the bacteria in your mouth to produce acid and this acid bathing the tooth surface eventually leads to holes and that's why it's really important to limit the time spent sipping that soft drink in the afternoon because the longer your teeth are exposed to that acid the more damage you can do did you know there's actually 10 2 teaspoons of sugar in one can of soft drink
1338,high_035,counsellor,no I didn't know that what if I just switched to diet soft drink instead there's no sugar in that right
1339,high_035,client,well Tom it's great to think you're being proactive about improving your health other studies show that diets offstring still has a high acid content that dissolves your teeth every time you take a few
1340,high_035,counsellor,okay well just like I got the chance can I ask you about this thing I've read online so it's where people swish coconut oil in their mouth and they use that to just stop the hulls from forming and they do that for about ten minutes should I give that a shot
1341,high_035,client,it's great to see that you're doing some you know your own research about help online and what you're referring to is actually called oil pulling there's not actually any strong scientific evidence to show that it prevents holes in your teeth I can see that you're really motivated to you know make some changes how about we talk about some ways we can simplify your oral health routine
1342,high_035,counsellor,yes it sounds good
1343,high_035,client,so first of all getting back to the risk assessment can I suggest that one can of soft drink we try to either drink it all in one go perhaps limiting you to about 10 minutes and even consider using a straw when you drink it
1344,high_035,counsellor,yeah well usually have it around lunchtime so I could just have it all in one shot then
1345,high_035,client,great that will give your teeth a break from all that sugar and acid in the afternoon and perhaps you could keep a glass of water handy instead Tom on a scale of one to ten ten being the most one being the less how motivated do you think you are to make these changes
1346,high_035,counsellor,well I really don't want these spots turning into holes so I say about eight or nine
1347,high_035,client,grain and we can talk about other ways you can simplify your drinks between meals
1348,high_035,counsellor,yeah sounds good
1349,high_035,client,excellent so one suggestion is to keep a bottle of water handy and sip that through the afternoon instead and perhaps even try some sugar-free chewing gum however I'll just try and keep it to ten minutes otherwise it won't lead to a bit of tooth wear and you could get a sore jaw
1350,high_035,counsellor,okay then I'll think about those ideas
1351,high_035,client,oh that's great so what I'll do Tom I'll make a note on your chart and then next time you're in will check in and see how you've gone with that yeah it sounds good
1352,high_036,counsellor,so where you said you'd like to start Sal is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other
1353,high_036,client,yeah my as was just been out of control lately and my doctor says it might be connected to Oscar
1354,high_036,counsellor,hmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse
1355,high_036,client,"I've got allergy testing. It's just the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing that's cut down. And then they said the drinking might contribute to it too. So I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know. The drinking, the smoking, and the dust that I got the scratch test for."
1356,high_036,counsellor,right
1357,high_036,client,and and that's what I know and that I take the medicine for it
1358,high_036,counsellor,okay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern
1359,high_036,client,no I've had it for 12 years and now it's a concern I don't understand
1360,high_036,counsellor,hmm yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free
1361,high_036,client,does that work what the boy said yeah
1362,high_036,counsellor,okay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards that
1363,high_036,client,mm-hmm I'm a little I'm a couple down I used to drink for a night now I'm down to three at least
1364,high_036,counsellor,okay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what what's next
1365,high_036,client,yeah yeah okay
1366,high_036,counsellor,so I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms
1367,high_036,client,well we keep him clean like he's clean so all the dander doesn't really make sense but I have been noticing sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside I wheeze a little bit but I think it has to do with um the hair the in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking so I don't know if it's that that's where I'm confused I don't know how this could be happening
1368,high_036,counsellor,hmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution
1369,high_036,client,but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit
1370,high_036,counsellor,I guess I also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long
1371,high_036,client,mm-hmm mmm I just want some medicine and I want to keep Oscar and I want to feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life in it honestly feels like my my nose is just above the water
1372,high_036,counsellor,mmm yeah and and in the end you know whatever you whatever you do about Oscar about your asthma about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda setting worksheet I mean you are in the driver's seat salad it really is your choice
1373,high_036,client,hmm ya know that feels good that I you know ELISA it is my choice I just feel like just about I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up and I'm kind of sad about things and I don't know I don't know what to do
1374,high_036,counsellor,there's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife with the new baby and and now thinking about looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby
1375,high_036,client,you know I want I want Giancarlo to grow up with Oscar so he has his friend when he's young too and I just it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you got to think about and I'm not feeling good about it
1376,high_036,counsellor,mm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how would you know when you win or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not
1377,high_036,client,yeah how would I know I don't know I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine if she gave me the strongest medicine and I wasn't working
1378,high_036,counsellor,mm-hmm
1379,high_036,client,that would be the way right now cuz I can't see I don't know how I'm gonna give this dog
1380,high_036,counsellor,oh yeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry
1381,high_036,client,no no it's something I got to just sit there and kind of put the pros and the cons on the table about but something's going on
1382,high_037,counsellor,hi my name is Arielle I'll be your dietician today
1383,high_037,client,hi my name is Emily
1384,high_037,counsellor,nice to meet you Emily what can I do for you today
1385,high_037,client,well my doctor sent me to you because I have diabetes type 1 I've been struggling with that blood sugar diet
1386,high_037,counsellor,have you been keeping up with your insulin injections
1387,high_037,client,I have actually but I've skipped some a few times because I heard not taking them actually helps you this week
1388,high_037,counsellor,and you have lost weight recently correct
1389,high_037,client,yes
1390,high_037,counsellor,I see well looking at your anyone C value of 12 tells me that your blood sugar for the past few months has been very high. We want to try and get that value down to seven. When you skip your injections do you notice anything different or do you feel differently?
1391,high_037,client,um get headaches sometimes and
1392,high_037,counsellor,okay those are actually symptoms of hyperglycemia or high blood sugar let's caused by a deficiency of insulin in the body do you know what ketoacidosis is okay when there is no insulin in the body the cells cannot get the energy they need to function to compensate that your body begins breaking down fat body this is what is referred to as ketoacidosis and this can be very life-threatening by leading to coma Oren's of your cases even death so those experiencing I'd usually have stomach pain nausea sometimes I have breath that's most fruity or like they say it smells like acetone or they have very labored reading what they call Kussmaul respirations and this is why taking your insulin injections it's very important so without it your body can't function
1393,high_037,client,Oh I dunno about that I knew I was supposed to take them but I thought skipping with you here and there wouldn't be such a big deal
1394,high_037,counsellor,well your body is completely dependent on those injections as without them that glucose gets built up in your blood if continued hyperglycemia will develop which is very detrimental to your body and then it's not corrected quickly it will need to ketoacidosis
1395,high_037,client,if there's so much sugar in my blood then why or whenever I should get my injections then wait
1396,high_037,counsellor,that's a good question my guess is that all the sugar it needs somewhere to go so your body gets rid of it through urine which is why you're always using the bathroom because you're gonna run up someone to fluid
1397,high_037,client,we're going to lose weight
1398,high_037,counsellor,you're basically depleting your wash stores and becoming dehydrated
1399,high_037,client,oh that makes sense now that explains why I'm so thirsty after I just get injections
1400,high_037,counsellor,exactly what we want to focus on is keeping your diet and insulin dosage in check also physical activity can help lower your blood sugar and help you lose weight and healthy weight what is your normal diet look like
1401,high_037,client,well to be honest I pretty much eat whatever I want the whole carb counting is just really okay
1402,high_037,counsellor,well hopefully I can explain carb counting a little more in-depth for you with carb counting our goal is to spread out the consumption of carbohydrates throughout the day in order to normalize your blood glucose so in general 15 grams of carbs equals one serving of carbohydrates so this will make it easier for you and trying to determine how many units of insulin you need to take and after eat a meal so one unit of insulin for 15 grams of carbohydrates at d1 service or however your doctor tells me so how many meals and snacks do you eat today
1403,high_037,client,I need three meals and snack appropriately throughout the day so it's a couple of times
1404,high_037,counsellor,okay so a starting point I would say aim for about 60 grams of carbohydrate or four servings at each meal and then between zero and 20 grams for each snack which would be about one serving of carb and also with each time you're getting your carbohydrate so at each meal make sure that you're balancing that out with some protein and fat as well so for example if you're eating like a piece of toast maybe put some peanut butter on it so that way you're getting your protein and your fat in there as well so do you know what counts as a carbohydrate
1405,high_037,client,bring
1406,high_037,counsellor,yes but there are cards instance of other places you find think up like fruits starchy vegetables milk yogurt and sweets and generally the next Rishon table can tell you how many carbs are in something so I haven't had that for you and on this front and up it shows you the nutrition label and it tells you the total carbohydrates and it kind of helps you break down the steps and like how to do the math so in the total carbohydrates you wants to have sugar alcohols and fiber and because you don't completely absorb those those don't quite count in your total carbohydrate so this helps you do the math on that and it makes it a lot simpler and this basically just breaks it down for you completely on the other side I hat side I have listed the some examples of foods that may not have nutrition labels on them so like fruits like apples and bananas they don't usually come with nutrition labels but on here I have like what a serving would be and we come to cards I would be for that surgery it's like one small half would be 15 grams of cards so does this make any easier
1407,high_037,client,sure does
1408,high_037,counsellor,alright well just be sure to keep track at the top calories and fats are consuming as they can add up really fast and lead to weight gain I also recommend staying active as I can how can you lose weight and lower your blood sugar just be sure to check with your doctor on what you can do and then you should take your is one before changing up your routine
1409,high_037,client,I will check on that thank you for seeing me and explaining everything in such great detail I will give you my carb counting and another counting another chart
1410,high_037,counsellor,my pleasure I look forward to seeing you and our follow up where we'll check on your progress
1411,high_038,counsellor,what's going on what are you feeling right now
1412,high_038,client,um I'm feeling disgust to Scully about what hope I can't do this like you can't do this
1413,high_038,counsellor,so so tell me what that feeling of disgust is what are you disgusted about
1414,high_038,client,uh just my body like just I don't know I feel like eating that just makes my body feel you know gross
1415,high_038,counsellor,mm-hmm
1416,high_038,client,uncomfortable I don't know
1417,high_038,counsellor,yeah well it sounds like there's some judgments in there right so it sounds like probably you're having some judgments like I'm feeling really bad yeah
1418,high_038,client,yeah
1419,high_038,counsellor,that sort of thing
1420,high_038,client,yes
1421,high_038,counsellor,but but you did say it more descriptively which is great which is you're feeling uncomfortable right now
1422,high_038,client,right just eating that makes me feel icky I don't know just
1423,high_038,counsellor,yeah and I can totally understand how you get to there if you're thinking I'm feeling fat I'm going to get fat you know it's an easy place to get to okay
1424,high_038,client,okay
1425,high_038,counsellor,but I feel like we're missing something too because I don't think it's just discussed I think there's another primary emotion in there what do you think that might be
1426,high_038,client,well I feel like just looking at that I that cake I feel like I just want to run out the door I just I don't want to be here
1427,high_038,counsellor,sure so what what emotion do you think that is
1428,high_038,client,being afraid being fearful
1429,high_038,counsellor,yeah
1430,high_038,client,of what will happen if I eat that
1431,high_038,counsellor,I think that's exactly right that's what I'm seeing you know. I see you kind of curled up over there you know. You have a very worried face you know and you're having a hard time approaching it. I think I think that's absolutely right that you're feeling fear and I want you to know that makes a lot of sense to me. You know when's the last time you've eaten cheesecake?
1432,high_038,client,I honestly I can't remember I don't know
1433,high_038,counsellor,I know it's been it's been a really long time he certainly didn't need it all through you know when you were really stuck in your eating disorder you know I used to
1434,high_038,client,I used to like it I remember that but it was such a long time ago and uh
1435,high_038,counsellor,and so you've been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you're feeling fear
1436,high_038,client,right
1437,high_038,counsellor,and you had said this is one of the hardest foods for you so that makes sense to me
1438,high_038,client,right so just see it like as a big blob of fat
1439,high_038,counsellor,right
1440,high_038,client,that was that it looks like to me
1441,high_038,counsellor,that's what what what is that it's a big Wobbuffet
1442,high_038,client,no judgment
1443,high_038,counsellor,yeah exactly you know I'm not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that all right
1444,high_038,client,okay
1445,high_038,counsellor,so because that's just not going to be helpful right now so what I'm wondering is since we know that it's fear that we're dealing with maybe if we can do some opposite action to that emotion do you remember what I mean by opposite action
1446,high_038,client,mm-hmm
1447,high_038,counsellor,what do I need
1448,high_038,client,instead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this and just you know check out basically right you want me to go towards it and you know just experience what I'm feeling and not go away from it
1449,high_038,counsellor,right exactly so you know fears associated with that urge like you said to run out the door so instead of running out the door we want you to approach the thing that's scary which is this cheesecake right now right
1450,high_038,client,right
1451,high_038,counsellor,okay so I see how hard it is for you and I honestly it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away but as you know the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake it's just going to make you more fearful the next time you come in front of some kind of food that's tough for you make it work yeah so by doing this hopefully over time your fear all go down okay
1452,high_038,client,okay
1453,high_038,counsellor,so can we have the fear right now and still take a few more bites all right
1454,high_038,client,okay
1455,high_038,counsellor,let's do it so how was that
1456,high_038,client,it's difficult
1457,high_038,counsellor,yeah I can see how difficult it is
1458,high_038,client,what I'm doing it but it's not football
1459,high_038,counsellor,exactly
1460,high_038,client,doesn't feel comfortable
1461,high_038,counsellor,no I wouldn't imagine it would but you did perfect opposite action right there which is you are feeling really uncomfortable and I can tell that but you still did it
1462,high_038,client,right
1463,high_038,counsellor,do you feel a little bit proud of yourself
1464,high_038,client,yeah
1465,high_038,counsellor,yeah
1466,high_038,client,a little bit
1467,high_038,counsellor,okay so this shows me that you can do it so let's try again let's take a breath and then we'll go back and do more opposite action
1468,high_039,counsellor,"hi George my name is Kaylee I'll be your nurse today I just want to let you know that everything we talk about here is confidential however I do have to let someone know if you're at risk of harming yourself, someone else, or if there is child abuse going on is that okay with you?"
1469,high_039,client,yeah that's there
1470,high_039,counsellor,okay so George doing a little bit about why you came into the clinic today
1471,high_039,client,well I have type 2 diabetes and I can't seem to find the time to exercise
1472,high_039,counsellor,okay would you mind if we explore this issue a little further
1473,high_039,client,no that's okay we can do that
1474,high_039,counsellor,okay so why don't we start by having you tell me a bit about your day and what seems to be getting in the way of you exercising right now
1475,high_039,client,well I live a very busy lifestyle and had work I've children I have John you know and then being a diabetic there's so many soft activities that come along and it seemed to have gotten control of everything else but it's just exercise I can't seem to find the time for it and it's very overwhelming and I feel this encouraged
1476,high_039,counsellor,okay so it feels like you're having trouble fitting exercise into your schedule and you're starting to feel pretty discouraged and frustrated
1477,high_039,client,yeah I just found out what to do anymore
1478,high_039,counsellor,okay so how important would you say this change is for you to make in your life we'll try on a scale from zero which is not important at all to ten which is very important to me
1479,high_039,client,they've always talked about exercise being important to diabetics and I can see how that is important both to me and maybe it's a seven
1480,high_039,counsellor,okay pretty important yes and how confident would you say you are right in this moment that you'd be able to make this change and we'll do the same zero to ten scale
1481,high_039,client,oh goodness um there's just so much I don't think I can make this change maybe a two -
1482,high_039,counsellor,okay so hopefully we can get that confidence up a bit and from what I hear you saying it sounds like you have been successful in the past making these changes related to lifestyle and incorporating exercise into your schedule is another really big change that might be really difficult for you to make
1483,high_039,client,yeah it might just even be too difficult maybe I should have even come here today
1484,high_039,counsellor,well you know what I'm glad you did come in today it shows you're in a serious about your health and you really want to manage your diabetes better I'm sure was really hard to come in especially since you're not sure you if you really want to make this change right now
1485,high_039,client,well I know how important it is for to keep my diabetes under control and how exercise can have an impact on my lifestyle and my diabetes but I've tried everything and I just can't seem to find a time
1486,high_039,counsellor,okay so it sounds like you know what can happen if you don't incorporate exercise so you know the risks and at the same time life is life is getting in the way
1487,high_039,client,yeah like I said that it's I just don't know what to do I know it's important for my health
1488,high_039,counsellor,mm-hmm okay so from what I hear you saying you're having difficulty incorporating exercise into your schedule and at the same time you know the importance of exercise and the risks associated with not exercising and being a diabetic is that correct
1489,high_039,client,yes
1490,high_039,counsellor,okay but you mind if I provided you with a little bit more information about the benefits of exercise
1491,high_039,client,sure I think that would be beneficial
1492,high_039,counsellor,okay good so for a diabetic an exercise can help lower your blood glucose which is very important you can also help lower your blood pressure and the great thing is that regular exercise can also help improve your energy improve your sleep and strengthen your bones and muscles which one of these benefits do you think you would appreciate the most
1493,high_039,client,well I would definitely love to have more energy it's very very overwhelming you're having to do all these things they're not advantage I feel so tired and even though I feel tired I don't get any sleep at night I find that I can't sleep so it would be wonderful to have the energy do the things to my day and be able to sleep at night
1494,high_039,counsellor,okay so it sounds like you're willing to make a change and you're getting kind of excited about possibly having more energy
1495,high_039,client,oh yeah
1496,high_039,counsellor,okay so can you think of any ways you might be able to incorporate exercise interest go to area
1497,high_039,client,well I Drive my kids to school every morning kiss them to go to school because I don't start work till like nine o'clock so maybe I could walk them
1498,high_039,counsellor,okay that sounds like an excellent plan how many times do you think you could walk them to school this week I assume they go to school every day
1499,high_039,client,oh yeah they do um I Drive them to school so maybe I can try walking them to school five days a week
1500,high_039,counsellor,okay George that would be great that sounds like a really good plan do you think there might be anything that could get in the way of this plan this week
1501,high_039,client,no it should be a problem I'm talking so late and the wife sleeps here in the house so I'll be fine
1502,high_039,counsellor,okay so great so the plan is to walk your kids to school every day this week and maybe you can keep track of this on a piece of paper just maybe take off every day of the week that you've done your exercise for the day this way you can keep track of things visually and you know you can watch your progress okay so if you have any problems during the week please feel free to call the clinic and ask for myself or another nurse although this is your decision ultimately we are going to support you along the way I don't want you to ever feel like you're lowering this and we will we'll play to meet in one week to see how things are going and hopefully we can follow up after that and get that confidence level up
1503,high_039,client,okay wonderful I'm glad to have you as it's important that you
1504,high_039,counsellor,thanks so much for coming in today I really commend you for taking that first step towards change thank you George
1505,high_039,client,thank you can we for your help
1506,high_040,counsellor,well cast our walls I'm really glad that you were able to find some time to actually get get together
1507,high_040,client,well it's good to see you're finally where you been
1508,high_040,counsellor,yeah that's right I know I was thrilled to see that you've made an appointment on my calendar and you know you have this benefit as a health coach and we've just never been able to find time to get together I know you're always running around helping someone someone or whoever I hear about that raving about pastor wall it's great help
1509,high_040,client,well I've got people that try to fit into the schedule to meet him for breakfast or lunch and around the work schedule and that keeps me occupied and trying to fit the schedule is
1510,high_040,counsellor,sounds like you're really running 24 7
1511,high_040,client,or 7 24
1512,high_040,counsellor,that's happily so blonde glad that you took the time out to you know think a little bit about yourself and spend a little time that we could talk about how things are going for you you know you give a lot of your time to everyone else but it's also good for you too you have some balance and think about things for yourself also
1513,high_040,client,is it really sounds like it so that's great that you decided to come in well thank you for letting me come you okay
1514,high_040,counsellor,so tell me about how things are going over overall I know you had mentioned in your email that you lost some weight recently
1515,high_040,client,yeah dead wife quit feeding me know
1516,high_040,counsellor,your wife's foot feeding you huh well I'm sure if you quit feeding you you would find some other great way to eat
1517,high_040,client,but that's all good little exercise helps on that and splitting meals sure meals instead of eating that big portion that the restroom gives you you know we split it that works
1518,high_040,counsellor,so you thought you've really found that when you want to eat you both order wasn't one portion and share it
1519,high_040,client,most of the time
1520,high_040,counsellor,okay so that and then adding more exercise
1521,high_040,client,more exercise yep
1522,high_040,counsellor,that's what seems to have worked for you
1523,high_040,client,yeah exercise helps
1524,high_040,counsellor,well what kind of exercise do you like to do I mean you probably get enough exercise just running around between folks
1525,high_040,client,well I do that but you know I roll out of bed then I run around the block three times then I kick the block under the bed and go back to bed
1526,high_040,counsellor,you do do you have to go for that early morning block block and monitor the neighborhood
1527,high_040,client,bicycle League works
1528,high_040,counsellor,basically
1529,high_040,client,yeah that works um
1530,high_040,counsellor,how did you get into that
1531,high_040,client,had a bike there and that's a good place to ride so that's easy to do
1532,high_040,counsellor,ok
1533,high_040,client,easy to do and
1534,high_040,counsellor,sounds like something you enjoy
1535,high_040,client,yeah yep good check out the neighbors see what they're doing is why they're really awesome right
1536,high_040,counsellor,then everyone's waving down pastor Walt with their
1537,high_040,client,30
1538,high_040,counsellor,latest thing that they're not talk to you about oh good well if there was anything about your health you're still thinking about now in terms of you know what's your next goal or what your next step or something you're thinking about
1539,high_040,client,mm not really that I know about
1540,high_040,counsellor,so overall things seem to be going pretty special you are you
1541,high_040,client,things are good
1542,high_040,counsellor,yeah so that's that's that's awesome it sounds like good a great place and sounds like the things you have implemented
1543,high_040,client,their works
1544,high_040,counsellor,and working really well
1545,high_040,client,it works
1546,high_040,counsellor,well on this scale of one to ten you know like we use that pain scale with people as nurses how confident are you that you'll continue on with what you've been doing as far as the portions and though bike riding
1547,high_040,client,Oh probably seven
1548,high_040,counsellor,is that a seven or an eight
1549,high_040,client,sure
1550,high_040,counsellor,so pretty confident that things will continue on it you can maintain what you've been doing and that's great you're not a zero
1551,high_040,client,well yeah like Cyril
1552,high_040,counsellor,well what makes you a seven and not a four in terms of confidence
1553,high_040,client,I guess that's just the way I am. It's just tough. It can be done. Maybe I can do it.
1554,high_040,counsellor,well because you've been doing it and you've been consistent and successful with it
1555,high_040,client,correct
1556,high_040,counsellor,and what would it take to make you be a nine in terms of being more confident that it'll happen all the time
1557,high_040,client,oh just another couple days on the bike a couple days out good
1558,high_040,counsellor,so what I'm hearing you say is that's kind of what you're wanting to get to is being able to global add a little more to what your schedule is and how do you see yourself doing that
1559,high_040,client,well that's the child because if you go to meet people for breakfast at seven thirty eight o'clock
1560,high_040,counsellor,Wow 730 a clumsy
1561,high_040,client,and try to ride a bike before and shower and stuff ahead
1562,high_040,counsellor,that means you're getting up pretty early
1563,high_040,client,so you do it in the afternoon what a ton of degrees no that doesn't work either so evenings maybe
1564,high_040,counsellor,okay so of course the Florida weather you've got those hundred degree humid temperatures where you feel like you're hot then you get on the bike
1565,high_040,client,right
1566,high_040,counsellor,island by the evening is it is it cool down some and we committed to taking off a little need me
1567,high_040,client,on the rare occasion all day
1568,high_040,counsellor,huh so that it's kind of picking those days of window I feel like going out there do I feel like sweating right now on the bike
1569,high_040,client,that's it
1570,high_040,counsellor,uh-huh so that seems kind of like your next focus on just trying to implement that
1571,high_040,client,yeah a little more be good but
1572,high_040,counsellor,well it sounds like you know you're doing a lot to really think about your house and to have a balance between what you're offering to other people but also taking time for you do you do anything just do do anything just for you time just to you know be able to just have your own time to enjoy and mind
1573,high_040,client,like grab a good book
1574,high_040,counsellor,mmhmm
1575,high_040,client,yeah
1576,high_040,counsellor,grab a good book that's always a great way to
1577,high_040,client,personal leadership
1578,high_040,counsellor,uh-huh
1579,high_040,client,looks
1580,high_040,counsellor,and you find that that gives you
1581,high_040,client,what yeah not one of those fluffy novel things
1582,high_040,counsellor,none of the fluffy Harlequins or whatever that the women like to watch read huh
1583,high_040,client,yeah note those
1584,high_040,counsellor,leadership something that gives you some more tools to work with folks that have some depth to them well that sounds great if we could just perhaps maybe talking you know a couple maybe four to six weeks and kind of see how that bicycling is going for you and just know I'm here for you and
1585,high_040,client,that's good so you're going to be here
1586,high_040,counsellor,yeah I'd love to continue to be your support
1587,high_041,counsellor,hi Sandra thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes I understand you don't have very much time but I really appreciate you stopping by
1588,high_041,client,well I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well I think it's important to quit but I enjoy smoking I'm not ready to give it up right now my life is too much in turmoil
1589,high_041,counsellor,so I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about but that overall coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter so can you tell me what was it that made it possible for you to even come in what were some of the things you were thinking about
1590,high_041,client,I think it's important because I feel like I'm a bad role model for my children. My daughter's turning 12 and already some of her friends have tried smoking. I don't want her to think it's a good thing.
1591,high_041,counsellor,so the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking
1592,high_041,client,I smoked when I was young and I'd certainly don't want it for her
1593,high_041,counsellor,and it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately
1594,high_041,client,well that's true it seems so hard I'm just not ready for this right now
1595,high_041,counsellor,so Sandra what's good about smoking what do you like about it
1596,high_041,client,it's very enjoyable relaxing you know it's stress reliever when I'm at work we all go out and smoke and chitchat and you know talk about things I would hate to not smoke really I'd be left out
1597,high_041,counsellor,what else tell me what else is good about it
1598,high_041,client,mmm I like to have a cigarette after I eat it sort of tells my brain I'm finished stop eating I'm full so it's it's a way to you know sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack so it's a way to control my weight
1599,high_041,counsellor,okay so is there anything else that you like about it
1600,high_041,client,let me think well I just enjoy it I think it's it's not good for me I know but I'm so used to smoking I don't really think about quitting too much
1601,high_041,counsellor,so let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking the things that you like about it and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out
1602,high_041,client,okay
1603,high_041,counsellor,so it sounds like it's a way to relax it's a way to socialize with your friends from work and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke
1604,high_041,client,that's true yeah
1605,high_041,counsellor,you also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight and concern that if you are we're going to quit smoking what that would do in terms of gaining weight and that smoking after meals is pleasurable that it's something that would be really hard to give up
1606,high_041,client,yeah
1607,high_041,counsellor,I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a nonsmoker. Does that capture for you some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?
1608,high_041,client,exactly mm-hmm
1609,high_041,counsellor,so I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking what about the other side can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things
1610,high_041,client,well I I'm worried about my children I feel like I'm being a bad parent and I often wonder you know they've seen me smoke for years I certainly don't want my 12 year old daughter to start smoking and some of her friends are already smoking
1611,high_041,counsellor,Sandra can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her
1612,high_041,client,yeah just this morning I was outside having a cigarette and when I looked up there she was looking out the window watching me smoke
1613,high_041,counsellor,so this morning that experience it really brought home how she does watch you and she does really look up to you and notice what you do how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you
1614,high_041,client,I felt terrible you know I was projecting I want to be a good parent and I don't feel this really parted the plan
1615,high_041,counsellor,and again thanks for your honesty in talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know on the one hand you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter
1616,high_041,client,mm-hmm
1617,high_041,counsellor,and on the other hand I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief socializing and it's something you can't imagine ever changing how do those two things fit together
1618,high_041,client,it doesn't fit you know it's the opposite side of the coin you know I'd love to do it but I don't think it's right
1619,high_041,counsellor,so why would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important that raised it up in the list of priorities for you
1620,high_041,client,well I can't think of anything right now okay I don't have any plans to quit it's just something I'm thinking about
1621,high_041,counsellor,so it's it's not so much that you don't want to quit in a way it's almost how could I do it that would work for me
1622,high_041,client,exactly
1623,high_041,counsellor,okay I appreciate we we probably used up the time that we have I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this is that something that would be helpful
1624,high_041,client,oh sure sure I'll come in tomorrow
1625,high_041,counsellor,Not necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do but I appreciate you willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. We have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do. One of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change. Why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?
1626,high_041,client,okay okay I'll give it a try
1627,high_041,counsellor,okay here you go
1628,high_041,client,thank you
1629,high_041,counsellor,so thanks for coming in Sandra we'll see you next week
1630,high_041,client,all right
1631,high_042,counsellor,I just I do today
1632,high_042,client,I'm alright I'm going a little weird lately and I can't explain it I'm just I feel off you feel off I just feel really off and not like myself and just not like I'm normal like I think that normal person should be feeling right now
1633,high_042,counsellor,you're not feeling like a normal person should be feeling
1634,high_042,client,I'm feeling a little anxious a little jittery a little I I don't know I just I just feel weird
1635,high_042,counsellor,I said you have some anxiety but you're not really certain of the feeling
1636,high_042,client,yes yes
1637,high_042,counsellor,okay I want to ask you a bit of an unusual question that is going to take some imagination to answer I want you to bear with me if you can okay so let's say that we we know you have this problem describing this partially anxiety based at least say that you were to go home tonight and attend to usual chores and you're to go to sleep so you're asleep and sometime during the night miracle curse and the problem you're having right now and its entirety is gone so the next morning you wake up but you don't know the miracle has occurred that makes sense
1638,high_042,client,it makes sense
1639,high_042,counsellor,so at this point as you wake up you don't know the miracle has occurred how would you recognize the problem is going
1640,high_042,client,I think I would just feel better like I don't know maybe not be jittery you know I can't be
1641,high_042,counsellor,jittery
1642,high_042,client,yeah maybe I mean I don't know maybe I would just I would just feel better on the inside
1643,high_042,counsellor,I try to try to think that's good trying to think specifically like you first wake up. Now let's go through let's go through your day. Say first wake up this miracle is occur but you don't know it's occurred.
1644,high_042,client,okay
1645,high_042,counsellor,so you don't know about the miracle you wake up believing that you would still have the problem
1646,high_042,client,okay
1647,high_042,counsellor,even though the problems not there
1648,high_042,client,okay
1649,high_042,counsellor,so let's move through let's move through the day and see when you would be able to recognize or what you would recognize so it's different
1650,high_042,client,"I think during the first half of my day I just it like when I wake up I do all the normal things. I make my breakfast, shower, shave, all that stuff. I generally don't feel jittery then. It's just when I start to actually go out of the house and just thinking about getting to work and stuff. It starts to just get a little jittery on the inside."
1651,high_042,counsellor,so you may not notice the problems go on when you're still home
1652,high_042,client,correct um but I think that once I actually got like to my office space I think that that's when I'll start to say hey you're you're you're not filling all jittery your palms are not sweating you're not being you're not really anxious about going into work today and something just starts to click and it's like hey this is just feels right instead of this feels wrong and I should here or I shouldn't want to feel like this alright
1653,high_042,counsellor,so the moment you get to work is when you think you'd really recognize that something about the problem has changed that it might be gone
1654,high_042,client,I think so and I think more I would actually understand or see the miracle had occurred is actually when I started to interact with my co-workers. Because I think that there that's where a lot of the jitteriness occurs or at least that's what I've been noticing. That I'm seeing that anytime I'm really starting to interact with my co-workers that I my heart starts to raise my hand starts to get sweaty. I I don't know what to say I don't know what to do. And I think that if all of that started to disappear then I think that I would notice that.
1655,high_042,counsellor,so that moment when you start to interact with your co-workers you would you would notice that you're not reacting in the way that you're used to react
1656,high_042,client,correct
1657,high_042,counsellor,which sounds almost like almost like intense anxiety or panic will you describe it
1658,high_042,client,I never really thought about it like that because I think that that's something that this naturally always been happening and it really never occurred to me to look at my work situation to see if by eliminated that or those people that all of the anxiety would go away. Because I think that even though when I come home I'm still thinking about working stuff is still happening and I'm still worrying about how I'm going to work with these people. That I still have a little jittery but I'm not as jittery or sweaty or whatever especially when I'm at the office.
1659,high_042,counsellor,so so the largest chance you're going to recognize the problem is going is during that in the office first really so there might be an after effect that you would it's going to be absent on your way home
1660,high_042,client,correct
1661,high_042,counsellor,but you feel like the symptoms the problem are really strongest at the often
1662,high_042,client,correct yes right yes I would say 100% yes when I'm especially when I'm interacting with this people it's specially large groups of people I think that that's when it really pops in and it just I just don't know what to do with myself and I think I could see that if I we had a say a group meeting um I think I would really notice that them because I wouldn't be worried about what I'm saying or how other people are viewing me or if people think I'm dumb or anything like that I think that it I would just be able to say what I needed to say
1663,high_042,counsellor,so the problem wasn't there you'd be relaxed and confident during these meetings
1664,high_042,client,yeah I think I would be I think being really confident and also I would be very sure of myself because I would know that this is what I'm saying it's right what I'm doing is right and I wouldn't have to worry about if my coworkers talking about hi my bag or if my coworkers laughing I wouldn't even care if they're on their phones because I know that what I'm presenting is going to be round alright so
1665,high_042,counsellor,it it seems like I've used to this question which we called a miracle question
1666,high_042,client,okay
1667,high_042,counsellor,it seems like it's helped you to identify what's going on a little bit it sounds like a social anxiety type symptom that they have going on
1668,high_042,client,okay all right
1669,high_042,counsellor,that's something we can certainly work on perfect and maybe it's giving you some insight into how that social anxiety seems to function throughout the day when it's more intense at work less less intense as you come home and in the morning we wake up really it doesn't seem like it's too bad at all so it's giving you an idea how those symptoms I've been flow through the day and what they might mean what might be causing them
1670,high_042,client,mm-hmm
1671,high_042,counsellor,so it makes sense
1672,high_042,client,that things could complete that's I think
1673,high_042,counsellor,we'll work on it don't work want to put some more framework around it but give that some thought what's going on the problem in terms of when it occurs you kind of you're recognizing habits work and reflect on that a bit and then I'll see you again about a week and we'll start moving through and see what we can do about the social anxiety
1674,high_042,client,okay perfect
1675,high_042,counsellor,that's how good Jeff
1676,high_042,client,that sounds wonderful
1677,high_042,counsellor,I'll see you then thanks a lot
1678,high_042,client,thank you
1679,high_043,client,then go ahead and have a seat right here
1680,high_043,counsellor,all right perfect
1681,high_043,client,you have all kinds of fun stuff for us today right I didn't change my ways
1682,high_043,counsellor,are you ready for that
1683,high_043,client,I am ready all right very excited
1684,high_043,counsellor,good well I am too and it's a pleasure to be here thank you for trusting me I've got the questionnaire that you filled out earlier for us and I brought that with me today
1685,high_043,client,okay
1686,high_043,counsellor,"I made a few notes for myself and I want to go through and ask you some additional questions. But before I get the questionnaire out for us to begin talking, let me tell you a little bit about today. And that today is about you. I'm gonna be asking you quite"
1687,high_043,client,well I never hear that very often
1688,high_043,counsellor,I thought you might enjoy that
1689,high_043,client,all right
1690,high_043,counsellor,so I'm gonna be asking you some in-depth questions and some of them you may have questions about why I'm asking the questions and you're perfectly okay to to ask me about that if that comes up for you I'm I can answer your questions as well but what I'm gonna be doing is asking you things about in detail about what kinds of things you eat and also other lifestyle things and that will help me put together a program for you moving ahead so thank you for the advance work that you did and thanks for your patience as I get the bag out here
1691,high_043,client,I'm anxious to see I analyzed all of that
1692,high_043,counsellor,well you know something you're um you are really already pretty far ahead in the in the continuum of things now that this is something that we should be judging it's not like there's a good way or a bad way and one of the things I say to my clients is this if we look at the way that we eat and we live our lifestyles as a continuum with one end of the spectrum being the standard American diet and people who we know are doing some unhealthy things and then at the other end of the spectrum you've got the really really really healthy people that you don't ever want to be around because they make you feel guilty for everything you do and every choice that you make yes we all do and if you can find a spot for you on that continuum that fits for you at any particular given period of time that's what it is that we're trying to do here and it's not a judging thing it's not that you're trying to get from one fit place together and and remember this also Michelle as we work together there will be points in time when you will feel like you're on top of the world and you're doing good job and something may happen for you that causes you to have a little bit of a setback maybe stress at work maybe something happens in your personal life whatever or maybe it's the holidays and you're celebrating and you might have what you would call quote a setback it's not the end of the world and we'll talk as we go along about how to address those types of issues how to deal with those how to head them off at the pass so this is an ongoing continuum kinds of thing and remember it's a lifestyle this isn't a diet
1693,high_043,client,right absolutely
1694,high_043,counsellor,that's where we're going with this so
1695,high_043,client,that's why that's why I like you and your approach and I think it's gonna be a nice fit for where I'm trying to get in my family and so let's do it
1696,high_043,counsellor,absolutely the first couple of questions that I asked had to do with what what it was you consumed and I asked whether or not you ate meat chicken fish and so forth you're not vegetarian according to this and so you do eat some of those things talk to me a little bit about the sources of the food that you get the meat product
1697,high_043,client,the sources I tried to buy you know is organic as possible that's not always the case you know sometimes we buy it in bulk we try to access the farmers that are in this area
1698,high_043,counsellor,ok
1699,high_043,client,have it available and for me personally I've you know meat isn't a focus of when I'm putting a meal together but my husband you know is a meat eater and so I try to incorporate it into things more for for his you know satisfaction than anything and you know it's not we don't need a lot of it but it is part of our Cherno part of our diet
1700,high_043,counsellor,ok and I'll I'm gonna hit the pause button for you and tell you you know that I am personally and vegan and I'm a raw foodist
1701,high_043,client,right
1702,high_043,counsellor,when I ask you these questions again it's not from a judging perspective it's not because I'm gonna say to you well we're gonna cut meat out of your diet in a hurry that's not the case at all what I'm asking the reason I'm asking is so that when I build things for you and build a program for you I'm accommodating the things that you're comfortable with if there are things that I ask you for example if you say I do eat meat now I don't want to and then we'll talk about that so that's where that question is coming from so I'm delighted to hear that you're conscious about the sources of your meat products
1703,high_043,client,perfect with it by any means sometimes it's what's available or I'm in a hurry or we're having people you know and but I do try to yeah get it
1704,high_043,counsellor,organic and local that's
1705,high_043,client,it natural yeah it's possible
1706,high_043,counsellor,that's wonderful and then obviously you're aware of hormones and antibodies and those kind or antibiotics and those
1707,high_043,client,right
1708,high_043,counsellor,we can let's leave that out yeah and the same thing with dairy products you've got some dairy products on your repertoire talk about that
1709,high_043,client,heavily I'm not a milk drinker but I do like cheese
1710,high_043,counsellor,mm-hmm
1711,high_043,client,and so and I cook with milk you know of course but I'm not I haven't drank milk since I was little
1712,high_043,counsellor,okay
1713,high_043,client,but I do like cheese and probably eat a lot of cheese and eggs and that but um you know I and like I said it would same with the meat I don't know that I want to do away with any of it but I just want to kind of what naturally evolves and happens with I just want to you know be smarter about how we prepare things and where we're getting it from then
1714,high_043,counsellor,right
1715,high_043,client,how we're putting it together
1716,high_043,counsellor,do you ever have any ill effects from the dairy that you can sue
1717,high_043,client,no
1718,high_043,counsellor,okay so you don't have a digestion issue
1719,high_043,client,I know I I'm pretty I I don't really have any ill effects from anything that I eat very very rarely
1720,high_043,counsellor,and the rest of the family is okay with that too okay good so when I'm asking the questions I'm primarily asking about you but if it if it comes up that somebody in your family if I hit a hot button and you say oh I don't have sinus problems but my my offspring do or my feelings do or whatever then let's talk about that as well um you have you have a husband
1721,high_043,client,yes I do and the daughter this turns 8 this month
1722,high_043,counsellor,Wow okay and no ill problem no health problems
1723,high_043,client,no
1724,high_043,counsellor,okay
1725,high_043,client,not with any of us
1726,high_044,counsellor,hello kelsey thank you for coming in today I'm Shelley see our own personal trainers I shall be through you um so why are you here today there's some behaviors you want to change anything that you want to take care of
1727,high_044,client,yeah I'm here because I would like stop eating so much sugar primarily in the form of candy
1728,high_044,counsellor,okay
1729,high_044,client,as I work out a lot i would say high intensities and I just feel like I'm always striving for this healthy lifestyle but then I will eat soon so girls in one sitting and it kind of ruins everything that I'm working toward
1730,high_044,counsellor,all right so um what are some pros and cons to eating candy
1731,high_044,client,well pros aren't that is delicious
1732,high_044,counsellor,it is
1733,high_044,client,and cons obviously it's not good for anything down the road I don't want to make it a habit because I honestly don't want to develop any chronic diseases or um it enables me to not lose weight even though it's not really goal but kind of always the goal um it doesn't make me feel good afterward that's for sure
1734,high_044,counsellor,what was that
1735,high_044,client,is enjoyable in the moment
1736,high_044,counsellor,alright so what I hear you saying is that you really enjoy how can you taste and it makes you feel good at the moment I'm assuming because you're getting the pleasure oh you can't be um but afterwards you just you don't like the way that makes your body feel you feel bogged down and gross and then potentially see the side effects of maybe unwanted weight gain and things that you're striving to prevent
1737,high_044,client,yeah that's exactly
1738,high_044,counsellor,okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 how much do you think you can make the change to quit eating candy
1739,high_044,client,well this has been a repeated effort for me so I'm going to say about a 7 because I feel like I can do it but I work around a lot of candy there's candy on my desk so it's kind of hard to resist
1740,high_044,counsellor,okay well it's not a zero so you have some confidence in yours
1741,high_044,client,yeah
1742,high_044,counsellor,all right um so when you say that you have candy at work is there any way you can get rid of that
1743,high_044,client,now because I work for an athletic director and the can use for the athletes post bay but
1744,high_044,counsellor,sometimes just thank you know the cookies over or katie jo should i say all right so what are your goals how do you see yourself quitting in canyons
1745,high_044,client,well i would like to start making like a foo dog and not lying to myself about how much candy i'm actually eating when i eat 32 the rules i should write down that I didn't
1746,high_044,counsellor,all right that's started
1747,high_044,client,you know maybe check that for six weeks and see if actually looking at how much candy I am eating will help me realize that it's
1748,high_044,counsellor,okay good good so what are you saying correct me if I'm wrong is you think that logging your sugar intake is going to help you see on top of the way you feel after you eat candy how much can you you're actually eating
1749,high_044,client,right yeah I'm going with that do i can write down you know how much i sleep or what else i'm eating and see if the g3 some candy helps with other
1750,high_044,counsellor,okay
1751,high_044,client,lifestyle factors
1752,high_044,counsellor,good good i understand that it's really hard quitting kidding i myself have been known in the past you eat a ton of canyon or the city right right this or can you explain me again just some more reasons why you think it's going to be hard and why you think you can do it
1753,high_044,client,well i think it's gonna be hard because i work every day but monday that it's on my chest tuesday and thursday i work in the morning so it's less likely for me to snack on it i don't really know why i just don't think about it in the morning and i'm only there for three hours so that would definitely be a reason why i would have a hard time resisting it but this this last week I've been putting up signs from the candies door that says no candy all right Pizza sticky
1754,high_044,counsellor,okay no good that's a good story
1755,high_044,client,always help quick
1756,high_044,counsellor,and can you clarify for me one more time the kind of pleasure you get from eating candy
1757,high_044,client,well obviously taste I'm sure it stimulates some sort of happy memories
1758,high_044,counsellor,okay
1759,high_044,client,um you know how we Easter Christmas is all about the candy
1760,high_044,counsellor,yeah so what you're saying is that candy brings back good memories and it tastes good and it makes you happy but at the same time it frustrates you and you're having a hard time letting it go because of work I mean it's hard to get rid of things when they're so prevalent in your life and candy is everywhere we look
1761,high_044,client,but strong
1762,high_044,counsellor,so I would just like to understand a little bit more on how you're going to put definite goals I'd like to write down four goals for you on how we want to derail your need for handy
1763,high_044,client,okay well so the first one I'm going to do is log my I think I'm gonna log all night and day
1764,high_044,counsellor,okay
1765,high_044,client,including candy
1766,high_044,counsellor,good
1767,high_044,client,and fruit could probably be it would be a definite factor in that as well um secondly I'm going to continue to put up those post-it notes in front of the candy jar saying that I should not eat candy network
1768,high_044,counsellor,okay
1769,high_044,client,um thirdly I have a Fitbit and I was thinking about writing like no sugar really small bed in it you know just as a reminder just when I think that nicca now probably shouldn't what do you have any suggestions about what
1770,high_044,counsellor,have you ever considered maybe talking to your boss I'll moving the candy jar from the table to maybe an instant table next to the door or something so it's out of reach
1771,high_044,client,right every two no I haven't but that's a good idea or even talk to him about so Jana with fruit or really anything else besides candy
1772,high_044,counsellor,because really i mean its athletes we're working with you and athlete like yourself
1773,high_044,client,i'll be passing out candy
1774,high_044,counsellor,should not be eating candy do i think that you can maybe make a push and get some gratification for yourself out of improving the lives of others one for being your own
1775,high_044,client,I think that a very good idea
1776,high_044,counsellor,ok so you're really willing to make this change apparently
1777,high_044,client,yes I want to make this change
1778,high_044,counsellor,ok um and you've already started you started with the post-it notes um my only other suggestion if you don't mind me giving you a suggestion
1779,high_044,client,how about that um
1780,high_044,counsellor,would be like you said with the fruit consider all of the food you're taking in because sometimes after you exercise your body crave sugar because you're not getting enough complex car such as like bread or rice or something like that before you workout so your blood Sugar's just dropping so just monitor the way you feel more than just the pleasure since you get from the delicious
1781,high_044,client,yeah all right

1790,high_045,counsellor,hi Patrick
1791,high_045,client,hey
1792,high_045,counsellor,my name is Christina I'm gonna be the therapist today nice to meet you too so before we start I want to know if it was okay if I take notes
1793,high_045,client,sure
1794,high_045,counsellor,okay great so can you tell me a little bit about why you're here
1795,high_045,client,um no because I don't really know why I'm here my dad kind of just forced me to come
1796,high_045,counsellor,okay why do you think he forced you to come
1797,high_045,client,no he's always forcing me to do stuff like whenever he wants me to do something he's always makes me do it it's not been asking if I want to do it you know it just makes me do it I never had these issues when I go visit my mom my mom was in New York and whenever I go visit her she's a lot more lenient she understands that if I have something that I need to get done I'll get it done she doesn't anyhow meet every second of the day to make sure I get it done if I want to go to Times Square as long as I stay within her rules and follow our rules she's okay with it the other week I went to Times Square with a friend and we hung out and it was a great day we got to go to Central Park we got to do all the stuff that I wouldn't been able to do if my mom had forced me to stay home I mean New York is an incredible City being able to walk around it explore it's so much fun and I just I mean I wouldn't be able to do it if I had been forced to stay at home I wouldn't have gone the neighborhood of Liberty we went and we just explored around and found all these cool little hidden places that we had never gone to before and it was so much fun
1798,high_045,counsellor,awesome okay so um New York time look it was amazing let's go back to your dad so you said your dad made you come here is that right okay so can you tell me a little bit about why you're frustrated looking
1799,high_045,client,I mean I don't really I guess it's just like I said because all of these making me do stuff that I don't want to do and he's always on me to do stuff that I have to get done. I'm 17 years old he doesn't need to be on me 24/7 to get stuff done and he doesn't always he doesn't have to make me do stuff I don't want to do. For example he always wants me to go to the store. I don't always want to go to the store with him but it doesn't matter what I want he makes me go. He food shopping he going to the fishing store the sporting goods store going to get crafts because he's a huge crafter. Like I don't need to go to those stores. I don't want to go to those stores. Why does he make me go to these things doesn't since I don't do crafts another crafty person.
1800,high_045,counsellor,yeah totally okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is always making you do things like chores and making you you go with him to places that you don't really want to go to is that right
1801,high_045,client,yeah it's not so much the chores like I understand that totally bugs I have to get those done and that's the thing is I understand what I need to get stuff done I know when I have to do my homework I know when I have to do my chores I know when I have to get up and go to school I understand all that but even those things he's constantly on me to do he's constantly as soon as I get home from school or home from work do your homework do this do that I understand that I have to get it done he doesn't need a tummy when I get home from work I'm tired I mean I work on my feet all day I work at a coffee shop like I'm serving customers and I'm often tiring at home and I don't want to do my homework I shouldn't have to do my homework maybe I just want to want to be or play games or play computer
1802,high_045,counsellor,okay so do you think that your dad doesn't understand that you're tired
1803,high_045,client,I don't even I don't know about that. I mean I think he understands. I mean he gets it. it's just you constantly on me to do stuff and I don't know why I don't.
1804,high_045,counsellor,okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is micromanaging a little bit
1805,high_045,client,a lot of it yeah he is trying to control every second of my life like I said I'm here I am he made me come here I didn't want to come here and offends you I'm sure you're a great person I'm sure you have a lot of friends and whatever but I don't want to be here that's just he made me come
1806,high_045,counsellor,okay so why don't we try something if that's okay with you I want you to talk to the chair like as if your dad was there I want you to tell the chair or your dad how you feel
1807,high_045,client,like that
1808,high_045,counsellor,yep
1809,high_045,client,I guess I would just say that tell him that I don't need him controlling every aspect of my life at
1810,high_045,counsellor,before you continue can you try to talk to the chair as if your dad was sitting there
1811,high_045,client,like actually look out of the chair okay I guess I would just say dad listen like you don't need to be on me 24/7 to get stuff done like I'm 17 I am gonna be going to college soon I know how to control what I need to get done in my life I know how to manage everything like don't get me wrong I know that you probably just have my best interests at heart but I don't need you every 10 seconds saying make sure you do this make sure you do that you need to do that you need to do that every now and then is a different story if you really want me to go to the store with you every now and then that's not that big a deal it's just when it's every single time that I've had the issue or if you just take the time and say every now and then it'd be like hey just don't forget you have to do this if you knew that like once every every we've got a couple of times a week even just once a day something like that it's gonna be a lot better than you just constantly saying make sure you get this stuff done
1812,high_045,counsellor,okay can you tell me about how that talked you're talking to the chair talking to your dad
1813,high_045,client,different I mean I guess I kind of realized that I might need a little angry with him and that might be why he want me to come but I mean it got it felt kind of nice to get that off my chest instead of just holding it in
1814,high_045,counsellor,good okay so it sounds to me like you're a little frustrated we get that I get a little angry that you are having a hard time with him telling you what to do you feel like you're an adult is that right so you feel like you're an adult you feel like your dad doesn't really understand that that there's kind of an imbalance there okay so I think we had a really good first session I want you if you can come back next week and we're gonna try to figure out how to talk to your dad so he can better understand that is that okay
1815,high_045,client,sure all right it was nice to meet you see you next week
1816,high_046,counsellor,hi Quinn I'm glad that you came to see me today my name is me and I'll be your nurse what would you like to talk about
1817,high_046,client,of your current myself if it's really from Captain tanner I'm also worried about my house will get worse if I don't exercise more
1818,high_046,counsellor,sounds like you're concerned about eating too many five foods and not exercising enough so which of these two concerns would you like to focus more on today
1819,high_046,client,our men testing within our society it's very important to control my blood sugar I'm finding it hard to attempt to exercise know since that I have to work five days a week and took it comes with my kitchen so I guess which the starter there
1820,high_046,counsellor,okay well I appreciate you bringing it up it's true many people with diabetes find it hard to add exercise to their life especially with their busy schedules it must seem overwhelming to have to fit exercise into your life when you have so many other priorities
1821,high_046,client,yes exactly
1822,high_046,counsellor,so tell me what's living with diabetes been like for you
1823,high_046,client,we are it had done w day I hope to watch what are you or the fam make sure I don't care you have a pic of my accident a top of that everyone goes to me I need to exercise and I really don't like ecstasy
1824,high_046,counsellor,you must be so stressful how to make so many changes to your life because of your diabetes adding exercise to your list of things to do isn't making your life any easier you mentioned that you don't like exercising so maybe we can look from your perspective what exactly you think that and the disadvantages of exercise are first of all what exactly don't you like about exercising
1825,high_046,client,it's so difficult to get started and to keep a movie I'm so tired after work I the rugged Esther real taxa and the CTL my culture and watched TV on the spend more time with my children
1826,high_046,counsellor,you struggle with exercising because you're already tired after coming home from work and exercise increases your fatigue
1827,high_046,client,yes
1828,high_046,counsellor,so tell me then what are the benefits of exercising to you
1829,high_046,client,I know then it becomes the to decrease to my blood pressure on me to lower my blood sugar that is not so tightly that's what the doctors decide
1830,high_046,counsellor,you understand that exercising here and prove your overall health
1831,high_046,client,yes
1832,high_046,counsellor,so where does that leave you now
1833,high_046,client,even though I know that our society of happily managing my sugar levels I just don't feel once are their facades
1834,high_046,counsellor,so as long as you feel fine you don't see the need to exercise
1835,high_046,client,oh that's right
1836,high_046,counsellor,what if you felt that your house was getting worse that you're starting to feel the symptoms of your diabetes even though the symptoms of type 2 diabetes develops slowly in the early stages and can go unnoticed for years if blood sugar is left uncontrolled it can lead to many complications would you like me to tell you more about that
1837,high_046,client,next room
1838,high_046,counsellor,for example diabetes can lead to health problems like hypertension nerve damage or even kidney disease
1839,high_046,client,because sorts as a lot you take insulin if you have to control your blood sugar and I may enjoy fried food sometimes but most of time and prettily almost alcohol
1840,high_046,counsellor,that's true insulin is a big part of glucose control and it's also great to hear that you're able to maintain a healthy diet despite your busy schedule that's quite an accomplishment exercise can also complement these effects actually exercise can help your bodies up your blood sugar and has been proven to be more effective or even or just as effective as medication
1841,high_046,client,what heck yes
1842,high_046,counsellor,so it seems that being healthy is pretty important to you and that having symptoms of diabetes or feeling sick worries you
1843,high_046,client,because I want to be able to take home for my kids they are i still can I don't want to be sick and unable to see them grow up
1844,high_046,counsellor,okay let me summarize what we just talked about you're not sure that you want to be here today the only reason you came is because your doctor felt that exercising more would help you manage your diabetes at the same time you haven't been feeling any symptoms of your diabetes so that's why I don't feel the need to exercise but if indicated that you want to prevent feeling sick and you like to be healthy for in order to take care of your children in fact you're ready doing so many things to help look after your health such as taking your insulin regularly eating a healthy diet and not consuming any alcohol did I miss anything
1845,high_046,client,no that's correct
1846,high_046,counsellor,"I see where you're coming from. Normally, in order to control her blood sugar, you have to live a healthy lifestyle. You're already doing a great job doing that by taking your insulin on time, eating regularly and a healthy diet, and not consuming any alcohol. So the only other thing you can do is exercise. But you don't see the need to exercise and you find it hard to fit into your schedule."
1847,high_046,client,sorry i don't like society but i do want to keep the interesting to look of mine are you saying lanta i can stay here say it even access long
1848,high_046,counsellor,yes that's exactly what I'm saying
1849,high_046,client,I'll be like this I coulda tried to start seeing them
1850,high_046,counsellor,all right if since you wanted to exercise would you mind if we took some time to find out how i feel about exercising
1851,high_046,client,okay
1852,high_046,counsellor,"On a scale of zero to ten in terms of how important you feel they need to exercise, zero being not important and 10 being very important, how important do you think exercise is to you?"
1853,high_046,client,I'm 17
1854,high_046,counsellor,seems that you think that exercising is pretty important then how come you're at a seven and not a two or three
1855,high_046,client,like Isis are that I don't want to this point of my kids I'm in too sick to care for me I will marry to do anything for them
1856,high_046,counsellor,the thought of not being able to take care of your kids scares you you must love them very much
1857,high_046,client,yeah more than anything in the world
1858,high_046,counsellor,now let me ask you how confident you are from the scale of zero to ten where zero is not confident at all and 10 is very confident in order to regularly exercise
1859,high_046,client,I remember I've had a hard time exercising you know Carston because I've been so Carrie. I just took tore down on the treadmill for 30 minutes but it was hard to do that every day. I think I meant for
1860,high_046,counsellor,so you're moderately confident what would help increase your confidence
1861,high_046,client,I mean I guess if I had the more encouraging them to exercise and or the increase in my confidence also it would exercise so tearing that we're gonna have to
1862,high_046,counsellor,in the past what is help you to continue exercising
1863,high_046,client,sometimes to my husband would encourage exercise but not the loss of him
1864,high_046,counsellor,more support from your husband would help you to continue exercising maybe we can also explore additional options as to how to motivate you to exercise
1865,high_046,client,like what
1866,high_046,counsellor,well you mentioned that you think exercising will take away from the time you want to spend with your children would you consider including your children in your exercise routine
1867,high_046,client,that's a risky idea i guess i put the puller you some games this then we really repre
1868,high_046,counsellor,and you mentioned earlier that you used to run to exercise but running is a very high intensity exercise it would be hard for anybody to run for 30 minutes a day would you what exercises do you think would be easier for you to try
1869,high_046,client,maybe you're walking
1870,high_046,counsellor,would you be willing to consider walking for 15 minutes after dinnertime
1871,high_046,client,that's what a walk
1872,high_046,counsellor,that's a great start would you like to schedule an appointment next week to discuss more about your fried foods consumptions and other ways we can help you to keep exercising
1873,high_046,client,thank you
1874,high_047,counsellor,we'll there's some things that have come up in in what I've seen so far I I just want to talk to you about your blood pressure it looks higher than I'd like and and obviously that concerns because there are some things that can happen with high blood pressure and I got to point out that the smoking in combination with the blood pressure concerns me and there may very well be cause and effect I'm sure the last thing you need is is somebody to to nag you but could we talk a bit about your smoking
1875,high_047,client,yeah sure I'm comfortable
1876,high_047,counsellor,okay okay so you smoked how long
1877,high_047,client,well 35 my first time I smoked was a I was 12 years old it progressed as I got through high school and I've been a regular smoker since about the age of 17
1878,high_047,counsellor,okay so about half your life you've been a regular smoker
1879,high_047,client,yep
1880,high_047,counsellor,okay about how much you did
1881,high_047,client,well oh it's kind of buried over that span of time but I'd say right now I'm about about half a pack a day
1882,high_047,counsellor,okay okay the most important thing I mean I've got slides will and statistics and all kinds of scary things I can say but the most important thing from my perspective is what your thoughts are about your smoking where you at with being a cigarette smoker
1883,high_047,client,well I am aware that it's it does have adverse health effects and down the road I perceive me at making a change in my behavior and and knowing that the health consequences associated with with smoking but that day is not today I don't feel like I really use you know when it started off as I mentioned as a teen it was more of a social thing
1884,high_047,counsellor,sure
1885,high_047,client,and acceptance my friends were doing it I got to college I was open and open to more people who were were smokers as well and it seemed to be more accepted and I've just been you know continued that uses of as an adult
1886,high_047,counsellor,yeah
1887,high_047,client,you know it's it's for me it's now become much more of a habit and just a routine as much it is is the I feel like the the nicotine in the effects of the the cigarette itself it's very much part of my daily routine this is part of your life this is what you do
1888,high_047,counsellor,yeah and you know I know it's it's you know the cost and have gotten increase in over the last few years with with the cigarettes but uh but like I said at this point in time in my life I have a trouble seeing myself quit I'm a little bit concerned about you know I've had friends who tried to quit as well some successful some haven't been as successful ones that you know have quit they've noticed they've gained a lot of weight and and that's kind of concerns me in my age ranges what kind okay so you're doing a lot of good thinking well what what I heard you say and clearly you're a guy who sought through some things about your health what I heard you say smoking has some negative consequences and I don't want those things to happen but today's not the day I'm not gonna sign up and say today all all quit cold-turkey right you know appreciate that I would like to know will more about what you know about potential negative consequences when you think about what happens to smokers even half a pack a day what consequences are we concerned about
1889,high_047,client,well my grandfather had had emphysema
1890,high_047,counsellor,chirp
1891,high_047,client,which is you know a direct cause of his smoking non-filter cigarettes for 35 plus years
1892,high_047,counsellor,yeah
1893,high_047,client,that concerns me
1894,high_047,counsellor,yeah
1895,high_047,client,you know shortness of breath I noticed you know I still try to do some limited and exercise and and sometimes it's very labor intensive for me when I'm exercising that's a concern you know the health of my family my wife you know being exposed to secondhand smoke is mostly concern you know we're looking at starting a family soon and and I know that behavior will need to change when when that when that time comes but I guess you know in terms of other health concerns you know you know the more unpleasant ones the the complaints from the family members about the smell of me
1896,high_047,counsellor,yeah yeah it's our that the the social pressure is a rough
1897,high_047,client,you know and now you know I with with different places and businesses outlawing you know smoking in side restaurants and bars around our area it's become much more of a challenge maybe publicly
1898,high_047,counsellor,so these real big health problems some of which your grandpa has emphysema certainly lung cancer another risk that people take and then you look at what's going on in your own health already a little short of breath sometimes not having the lung capacity that you'd like to have social pressure exposing your wife you know I I wish I could say that's not a word but I think you're doing some good thinking I do think part of why all this hassle about smoking publicly has happened is because if your wife's exposed certainly it's the two of you had children if your children were exposed there are some real health consequences to people who are around you when you're smoking and already some some sense of some symptoms you've had with so it's you're breathing all right are there any other you mentioned breathing and people's negative reactions your fear for your wife's health are there any other things that I should understand that you don't like about being a smoker other concerns
1899,high_047,client,you know uh I mean I guess it's in terms of my health you know the my teeth the yellowness of that the whitening of teeth and the appearance that I have you know the I guess there's one thing on the surface that's of concern you know really I think that the respiratory issues that we talked about you know
1900,high_047,counsellor,sure
1901,high_047,client,the lung cancer those were pretty much my primary big ones you're not concerned with but you know the the routine that I have with the smoking is it's so ingrained in my lifestyle that it's just really hard for me to fathom being of stopping
1902,high_047,counsellor,yeah
1903,high_047,client,you know I've not really made a strong effort in the past to to quit you know if I've sampled some of the nicotine gum from friends who've tried it
1904,high_047,counsellor,right
1905,high_047,client,and didn't care for that it was found it you know not an equal replacement for the real thing
1906,high_047,counsellor,yeah yeah
1907,high_047,client,and I think that's kind of worrying
1908,high_047,counsellor,okay so so when you weigh things you just say man I'm concerned about weight gain this trick I know the gum didn't seem so great what else do you know we'll about sort of small steps people could take who don't want to get emphysema or lung cancer or have this thing progressed are there any small step you're telling me you're not really quit cold-turkey
1909,high_047,client,well I think I mentioned in the beginning when we were talking at you know the the volume of cigarettes that smoke is kind of varied over the years there was a time in my early 20s where I was pushing close to a pack a day including trying to reduce the amount great is is one I guess more tangible a realistic option and in terms to losing it
1910,high_047,counsellor,absolutely
1911,high_047,client,rather than cold turkey although I've kind of heard mixed messages that maybe cold turkey is the best way to go or not so I'm not really clear on what would be the best strategy to apply
1912,high_047,counsellor,well you've taken an important step will one of the first things I say to people who say I can't stop cold turkey is could you consider cutting back that's a huge step that is significant it's not perfect but I'm not in the business of perfect patience will I'm in the business of people taking small steps and this is this is a big one and I want to congratulate you I do know some things about other steps will and and even it sounds like quit cold-turkey isn't a step today but I do know some other options some other options to lay out potentially would it be ok if you and I talked about those other options that you could just file away for when you're ready
1913,high_047,client,sure I'm always open to some suggestions and advice when it comes to this absolutely
1914,high_047,counsellor,great
1915,high_048,client,I'm feeling very stressed out lately a lot of tension couldn't tell me more about that I just feel like nothing I do is good enough I work really hard I try really hard but I'm still having a really hard time
1916,high_048,counsellor,so what I hear you saying is that you're feeling really stressed and kind of stretched out too thin
1917,high_048,client,I am stretched too thin I'm trying so hard but I can't live up to my dad's expectations I really love him but it doesn't feel right or what it should be like my friend's parents support them
1918,high_048,counsellor,and what do you wish things would be like
1919,high_048,client,I like to have more free time I have lots of friends and they get to relax and hang out after school and I don't get to do any of those things I like to do that or spend time with my boyfriend my dad has always pushed sports if it's not volleyball it's another sport and I just want to make him happy
1920,high_048,counsellor,that sounds exhausting so it sounds like you're feeling this contradiction of pleasing your dad and meeting his expectations but you also want to enjoy yourself and be young is that right
1921,high_048,client,yeah
1922,high_048,counsellor,so that must be really frightening to be so confused about your dad's expectations and I also imagine you feel pretty frustrated with them yeah I am frustrated with them
1923,high_048,client,if I don't please him it makes me feel like I'm not good enough
1924,high_048,counsellor,what do you think your dad wants you to be like
1925,high_048,client,well he wants me to be in really good shape make the best of grades graduate with honors so I can get into a really great school and I know he just wants the best for me and I want to make him happy
1926,high_048,counsellor,I can really hear you really love your that don't you
1927,high_048,client,yeah which is why not living up to his standards is so hard and
1928,high_048,counsellor,so it's this feeling that only a part of you is acceptable and that doesn't leave much room for you to be human does it
1929,high_048,client,no it's like he wants me to be perfect perfect like those women in the magazines
1930,high_048,counsellor,yeah and if his love for you is based on picture what's the good at that
1931,high_048,client,you're right it is no good I can't ever be good enough for him I can't ever live up to his expectations and we have this college visit coming up I feel like college is too far away is too far to the future I feel like it's too much pressure and I'm not even sure if that's where I want to go to school I could visit at any point but it's this weekend my boyfriend was going to take me to a concert that all my friends are going to I want to enjoy my life not worry about the future my dad said we had to go now even though he knows about the concert this weekend what should I do it's not where I want to go anyway but I can't tell my dad I could never tell him that's not where I want to go I want to be a kid I want to enjoy my life I just don't think it's fair why do I always have to live up to what he wants me to do what should I do should I tell my dad I don't want to go
1932,high_048,counsellor,so this is the conflict it's really hard for me because I want to give you an answer and I really wish that I could give you the answer you want I really mean that
1933,high_048,client,but that's why I'm going to therapy I thought you were supposed to tell me what to do
1934,high_048,counsellor,well I don't mean to be evasive about this but I just I want to know what do you think you should do in this situation
1935,high_048,client,I don't know why can't I just be like a normal person and tell him I don't want to go why do I tell him things I really don't mean
1936,high_048,counsellor,and so I catch that the real deep puzzle is you feel this what should I do sometimes it's sad for me to notice how hard you are on yourself about yourself and I really appreciate you sharing this with me well
1937,high_048,client,yeah I'm hard on myself because I need to be but I hate how I always have to live up to such high standards
1938,high_048,counsellor,and so the thing that comes to mind is me asking what do you wish I would say to you
1939,high_048,client,I wish you would tell me what to do I feel like there's a part of me that really wants to please my dad but in order to please him I don't feel like I can be myself there's just a part of me that feels lost and unsure of myself
1940,high_048,counsellor,yeah I really hear that and to me at the same time you don't sound too uncertain
1941,high_048,client,oh really
1942,high_048,counsellor,yeah judging by the tone your voice it sounds like the thought of doing what your dad wants you to do is more uncomfortable than it is for you to actually tell him how you feel
1943,high_048,client,I just wish you would listen that he wanted to know how I feel he just wants me to be the perfect daughter but he doesn't even know the real me
1944,high_048,counsellor,and so you sort of feel this I want my dad to like me for who I am
1945,high_048,client,yeah I'm not the straight a size zero perfect girl and I can never be good enough I can never be smart enough or skinny enough and
1946,high_048,counsellor,when I think I'm hearing you say is that you'd like to feel accepted for your dad
1947,high_048,client,yeah that's what I want how can I do that do you think I should say something to him
1948,high_048,counsellor,well I feel like this is a really private thing that I couldn't answer for you but I'll definitely try to help you come to your own answer
1949,high_048,client,it doesn't matter how much I want him to accept me you wouldn't like the real me I could never live up to his expectations the thought of even saying anything is terrifying because I know he would be so disappointed would it even be worth it to say something to him
1950,high_048,counsellor,I'm really not sure it's an awfully risky thing to live and you'd be taking a chance with your relationship with him and you'd also be taking a chance with yourself
1951,high_048,client,yeah it really is risky I'm never in control of anything sometimes I feel like the only thing I have control over is
1952,high_048,counsellor,that sounds really upsetting I think what I'm hearing you say is that by controlling food is the only way that you feel it you can make a choice for yourself
1953,high_048,client,even just talking about it right now is making me really tense because it's making me think of everything I ate today counting the calories is one of the only things that makes me feel better because it's something I can control
1954,high_048,counsellor,so you're feeling anxious at the moment and like your only relief is in controlling what you eat
1955,high_048,client,I guess that's the only thing my dad can't control that it's just mine I don't think that's right I wish I didn't have to be so hard on myself and I could eat like everybody else does
1956,high_048,counsellor,so it's quite clear that the problem isn't just with your dad or your relationship with him but it's also at you as well and in this question of how can I accept myself
1957,high_049,counsellor,hi Alex my name is Tony I'll be your nurse for today how are you doing
1958,high_049,client,I'm okay I guess just waiting for the stitches to come out it would be nice
1959,high_049,counsellor,okay tell me a little bit more about this firefight
1960,high_049,client,okay story time you rate this so proud my girls having a fantastic time looking off on fleek and ish and then this girl like she has the nerve to stare at me from across the room it gives me this kind of it come on like this and then she comes up to me she bumps into me she spills my drink and she comes up and then she's like there man so I'm like excuse me so obviously I pushed her she pushed me kind of thing and yeah one thing led to another all right so it's a blur from that point on but all I know is that cops showed up I'm here and I have this to deal with fantastic great
1961,high_049,counsellor,okay from what I'm getting here is you were intoxicated at that point in time and then you had a confrontation with this girl which led to the bar fight and
1962,high_049,client,I was more than toxic it Oh smash oh you should have seen it but like this type of thing doesn't happen often so I don't want you to be sitting here and referring me to some AAA because yo I'm not an alcoholic
1963,high_049,counsellor,okay so it seems that you can't offend that they feel offended you refer to me
1964,high_049,client,yeah I'm not an alcoholic no I'm
1965,high_049,counsellor,okay because it labels you guys mom
1966,high_049,client,yeah exactly
1967,high_049,counsellor,over yeah all right of all we do have some time right now if it's okay with you I wonder if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits
1968,high_049,client,yeah sure no
1969,high_049,counsellor,I do you what is drinking you for you would have
1970,high_049,client,yeah well you know being 25 that's what we do like we get together we'd hang out we get a couple of drinks it's me and my girls we do this all the time and I love this it breaks the ice when we go socializing so meet new people kind of thing you know girlfriends circle it's it's fantastic and it definitely relaxes me after a stressful week and my weeks are so stressful is I need this you know so I mean yeah but just so you know I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that
1971,high_049,counsellor,okay so to me this is our drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends is your way to socialize and it breaks that I guess right it helps you socialize and you know I'm I also wanted to say that experience I was responsible of you to be drinking and not driving
1972,high_049,client,thank you
1973,high_049,counsellor,how does it affected your life
1974,high_049,client,who has it well I mean now that this happens I do have it because of that bar fight and he's gonna be disappointed so I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry it's been great fantastic but he says that when I drink it's like I'm not myself it's like somebody has never met before and obviously you can imagine the arguments the fights and oh my god all that stress it's just I love him so much but you know but it does stress and that's like I don't forget to make it it it's just
1975,high_049,counsellor,so for my understanding drinking it helps you socialize his friends it relaxes you it's you know here we have just you know it breaks that ice for you on the other hand it's causing that a lot of arguments of do you and your significant other Henry
1976,high_049,client,yeah
1977,high_049,counsellor,and it's causing a lot that that all those arguments are completed you a lot of stress in your relationship this manager
1978,high_049,client,yeah I mean we're engaged you look pretty this is well I don't like you put it that way I mean I'm worried because what's he gonna think of me later on the link once again I tell our children all your mom is an alcoholic she drank this and they go into fight I don't want I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way but at the same time I mean I don't want to quit cold-turkey I mean you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it but I love him so much I mean I would do anything for him and he's gonna be so he didn't even say I don't know how can I face him
1979,high_049,counsellor,this seems like a little Brady lucky died to have someone who loved him that much
1980,high_049,client,mmm boy seriously he's not gonna find anybody that loves him as much as I do trust me on that it's not gonna happen
1981,high_049,counsellor,so what I'm getting here right now is that if you just want to quit
1982,high_049,client,yeah
1983,high_049,counsellor,yeah and it's just partly because um but this alcohol is the leading to the arguments with Henry and it's necessary relationship
1984,high_049,client,yeah
1985,high_049,counsellor,I noticed over a year there and I know you don't really like like the idea of it. but what do you know about it eh like what's one shift of light on that
1986,high_049,client,it's a place or alcoholics go to discuss their problems and like I said I'm not an alcoholic
1987,high_049,counsellor,mm-hmm well you're right there for multiple walks of life and they share their drinking stories and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey if you can so prayer together
1988,high_049,client,okay
1989,high_049,counsellor,I don't even want to join eight at this point in time
1990,high_049,client,okay
1991,high_049,counsellor,mom's but hypothetically speaking would you ever consider joining it
1992,high_049,client,if this is what I have to do to get my guy back I'll do it
1993,high_049,counsellor,mm-hmm okay well on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm 10 mean like for sure and 1 being not really sure about it at all what would you say where you are on the scale with 20 an 80-acre know that you
1994,high_049,client,put it that way and everything I told you I would say 6 yeah
1995,high_049,counsellor,why would you say sticks instead of say that's really I mean you're really adamant about not doing anything
1996,high_049,client,well it's all about it's all about Henry at the end of the day it's it matters to me if I want to keep disengagement and I will do anything for that man so of course this is what I have to do this to do this is him live including his relationship with me and it's so much more important to me than drunk in a bar I'll tell him that
1997,high_049,counsellor,yeah so right now we're sitting at a six what needs to happen stated maybe we can jump that to an eight or nine
1998,high_049,client,um you know like flexible hours maybe if that isn't even an option um also maybe there's maybe if there's a place nearby somewhere like nearby my house I'll be great so off to waste gas its expense I already go to work and it's far anyway and um like I guess I guess it has to do with attitude as well I don't want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look and my drinking habits and all of that so I guess I'm just looking for a good vibe you know I don't want to be judged not labeled
1999,high_049,counsellor,yeah all of these are like really understand aborning it's just of course you want something I mean you need to be close to use you don't have to commute so far and
2000,high_049,client,yeah

2019,high_050,counsellor,with your husband
2020,high_050,client,yeah and I mean um a one hand I know that that's where i'm wanting to go possibly but on the other hand i'm wanting to stay so I'm kind of torn between if that's where i go with it
2021,high_050,counsellor,so you feel torn stuck between decisions about
2022,high_050,client,yeah and it's just I don't know what which way I need to go right now ok so it's Rick me feel like you need to leave your husband well lately hey jess has a good helping me or parenting our son's one a damn cat scratch fever and so we've been having to make a lot of visits to the emergency room and he has not been going with me to these visits and he also has not they have been watching the other son Wong going to the hospital and it's just been adding a lot of stress on me
2023,high_050,counsellor,so sometimes you're stressed because your son's how's his health issues
2024,high_050,client,some sporting a nice pen somebody other than providing nothing yeah and I mean it's just been very stressful life I just I want him to be the father figure you know one him I wanted to be a partnership in handling our children but he just I've told you this a hundred times and he's just not listening to me like we're at the hospital I he was just like i'll be there and then he never showed up and I mean I don't want that but on the other hand I don't want I really don't believe him neither so I'm kind of stuck on what I need to do you I don't know what the best decision is so we're here is like the other idea of my vonage of being a partnership from supporting in advance and he's not very same time you understand yeah yeah it's I want to stay with him for his relationship with my son's I don't want to take I'm scared if I take their father under their life you know they may not have a relationship with them anymore and I don't want to hurt that
2025,high_050,counsellor,okay sounds like email about it sometime relationship with his father you feel is 50 leaving the relationship will be damaged it someone
2026,high_050,client,yeah he's I mean he's not he isn't it being the best parent right now for as far as a partner but I know he cares about them and I know that you know my son's look up to them very much so what would be the worst case so you want to for Charm School but it would hurt their relationship that he might decide that he doesn't to be a quarter lessons life at all and then I taken their father away from you you know that's what I feel like at least that that would hurt film he also very normal fears about messing up the family
2027,high_050,counsellor,mm-hmm separating your kids
2028,high_050,client,yeah that's something that I worry about for the rest of course
2029,high_050,counsellor,if you were to leave them
2030,high_050,client,well that he was still continued have a relationship with employees but I would be able to find happiness because I might be right extremely happy and I don't see him changing in the future because this is the gone off a few years and I'm talking about it and he's just very he's not going to change right now and so I would the best case scenario would be that I would be able to find someone later or finding myself to be happy but you know I'm just not it's bringing me down happiness is a party but as well as you your son's happiness
2031,high_050,counsellor,yeah and said I mean that's what I'm Stefan is that do I stay with him and even though I'm unhappy and even though he's not being emotionally supportive for me so that he could have that relationship with my son or do I leave him and possibly hurt their relationship but by a find better support for myself
2032,high_050,client,so if you have some someone feels about keeping your family together what's coming happen
2033,high_050,counsellor,yeah maybe this up
2034,high_050,client,okay your feelings
2035,high_050,counsellor,yeah and he's um he's hidden danone considering leaving him I mean I started it in the past but he just always ignored it and just blow it all I child leaving him before but I never was able to do it for more than a couple of days hey this is my hair I mean or like with the parenting thing I want to get there I'll me get better but it never happens so what's up a lot of fun
2036,high_050,client,but you have to see this behavior
2037,high_050,counsellor,yeah and so that's why it because they give you more depressed is that I'm just stuck and I don't I don't know what to do instead become go stalking approach
2038,high_050,client,yeah yeah
2039,high_050,counsellor,I mean it's just I'm crying all the time. I'm all happy. I'm feeling so overwhelmed with everything I'm having to do. I'm getting a lot of stress from my parents because they're having to help out a lot because he's slacking. They feel that since I married that he should be helping me financially. He should be helping me with the kids and that's just not happening.
2040,high_050,client,Stressful. Your family also seems to have you feel things should be supporting. These one.
2041,high_050,counsellor,yeah it's just it's causing a hard the conflict in my life and I just never know it she's making me really happy sounds back around doing nothing everyone i am basically doing the same routine besides going to take my son to all the doctor visits and hospital visits I have no friends because I don't have any time to myself because I'm basically a single parent even if someone else's in the household I I'm not I don't have anything to do outside of the house and I hard time
2042,high_050,client,you do anything I saw the house sounds like
2043,high_050,counsellor,yeah yeah I know I'm the annoying if we weren't together my family would be more helpful you know they even offer me any support if I just leave you know that I could live a diff and that would help me with the boys but for now you know they're kind of saying it as he is to step up since he's the one I'm living with it is just not happening and I'm always stressed as well about money because he's he's not providing adequate finances for our family there's times where hundreds and hundreds dollars go missing him off them here's no idea where it's gone too and that's very stressful so all so much for the money
2044,high_050,client,sorry yeah I mean I'm just be sure you're happy about the situation but I don't want to make the wrong decision and hurt our children either so what would be your first step just like a better point if you wanted to to link them
2045,high_050,counsellor,so you know um I guess to figure out where i'm going to say my parents had offered her place i have a couple friends who offered a lot of jobs so i would have to stay with somebody else
2046,high_050,client,don't you feel about making their stuff
2047,high_050,counsellor,I would I mean right now I'm I feel like I'm not ready to do that to take that except I feel like I'm scary at first steps best food we've been comfortable with yeah and I don't want to have to explain to a child you know why mommy her mommy both boys are moving to make plays
2048,high_050,client,so we've got a lot of thoughts in your head the buildings in Smith just give her stuff to have done people want to tell you something that you weren't even husband about it
2049,high_050,counsellor,yeah yeah and i don't mean I values the love moments into I don't want to it makes me sad to think that I feel me more like you know like my husband anymore if I do that ok you may not we may not be able to work it out if I go through you know how am I actually and that's splitting up so it's scary soon over i watch mr. bone switch your family yeah and it's um it's worrisome picking their steps so I'm so far the probe
2050,high_050,client,the Miller one support from your husband which are not getting that but Gail may not look at that at the same time do you want to stand it has a family and even if the support is not much new happen it's much better than what you feel not again if you what I mean

2072,high_051,counsellor,so I know that the gym is usually the place where he cut because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there
2073,high_051,client,yeah
2074,high_051,counsellor,okay so where between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym where did you decide to cut because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody so there must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut
2075,high_051,client,I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her. I'm gonna get in trouble. I'm gonna go cut.
2076,high_051,counsellor,okay so that was when you decided to cut and you went down to the gym
2077,high_051,client,mm-hmm
2078,high_051,counsellor,and what happened when you got there
2079,high_051,client,well nobody was there because gym class isn't in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym so I went behind the bleachers
2080,high_051,counsellor,what did you use to cut
2081,high_051,client,the pencil that I have always used
2082,high_051,counsellor,to the same pencil as usual

2092,high_051,counsellor,what were you thinking at that point
2093,high_051,client,well I thought couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly
2094,high_051,counsellor,so you have your pencil where did you cut

2097,high_051,client,three
2098,high_051,counsellor,how deep did you cut where was it was it deep enough that you needed a band-aid did you need more than a band-aid
2099,high_051,client,no I mean I guess I could have used a band-aid but I mean whatever
2100,high_051,counsellor,but it wasn't so deep that you needed something more
2101,high_051,client,no
2102,high_051,counsellor,okay right after you cut where were you on the scale of one to ten with your feeling with your anger like a
2103,high_051,client,3
2104,high_051,counsellor,3 what were you thinking right afterwards
2105,high_051,client,that felt good I feel better and I'm going to have to talk to Michelle about this
2106,high_051,counsellor,did that feeling last you for the rest of the day they're feeling better um yeah for the most part yeah did
2107,high_051,client,okay so that's what happened right afterwards
2108,high_051,counsellor,mm-hmm
2109,high_051,client,later in the day what were you thinking about the cutting well
2110,high_051,counsellor,I kind of forgot about it okay but then I just started thinking about it again right before bed and just feeling really guilty that I cut because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean I the night time I just I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like. I mean you know it's usually a pretty hard time.
2111,high_051,client,I know net is a really difficult time for you
2112,high_051,counsellor,it is everything seems worse at night
2113,high_051,client,yeah
2114,high_051,counsellor,so you were thinking back it up back on it then and you were feeling guilty
2115,high_051,client,yeah
2116,high_051,counsellor,sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon
2117,high_051,client,no not always seems to happen
2118,high_051,counsellor,sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last
2119,high_051,client,yeah I guess so
2120,high_051,counsellor,I know you've also been working on doing less cutting
2121,high_051,client,I've been doing pretty good
2122,high_051,counsellor,you have you've been working really hard I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings
2123,high_051,client,yeah maybe I mean those guilty feelings really suck
2124,high_051,counsellor,okay so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut at your locker what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim
2125,high_051,client,yeah because she's stupid
2126,high_051,counsellor,okay it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day you said he hadn't called he hadn't been texting as much and that was on your mind
2127,high_051,client,yeah that's right
2128,high_051,counsellor,so I'm wondering if at that point if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting
2129,high_051,client,okay
2130,high_051,counsellor,that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit
2131,high_051,client,it's not going to bring it down all the way to a three though I'll tell you that much
2132,high_051,counsellor,it might not but it'll bring it down a little bit maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more
2133,high_051,client,alright
2134,high_051,counsellor,maybe there'll be things you'll feel good about later you won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back
2135,high_051,client,alright
2136,high_051,counsellor,so the first thing is that pencil it sounds like it's comforting to have it
2137,high_051,client,yeah it is
2138,high_051,counsellor,it also sounds like it's tempting what do you think about that
2139,high_051,client,I mean only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting I'm
2140,high_051,counsellor,having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things and you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less
2141,high_051,client,yeah I am
2142,high_051,counsellor,sounds like that pencil standing in your way
2143,high_051,client,yeah maybe
2144,high_051,counsellor,what do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time choosing a different favorite pencil but maybe you can't cut with
2145,high_051,client,I mean maybe only only if it's can be like a really cool pencil
2146,high_051,counsellor,that way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you that'll make it easier to try the two things
2147,high_051,client,yeah
2148,high_051,counsellor,okay what do you think our first thing should be what do you think you can try you just heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry what can you do in that moment
2149,high_051,client,what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't want to hear I put my headphones on
2150,high_051,counsellor,do you have your headphones with you at school
2151,high_051,client,yeah they they actually they let me keep them on in school
2152,high_051,counsellor,is that something you'd be willing to try next time
2153,high_051,client,I think so there's a there's a few songs that usually help me so I think so
2154,high_051,counsellor,okay that sounds like a good one to try so we have headphones I need to come up with one more what do you think you'd like to try
2155,high_051,client,well I really like my teacher mrs. en so she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk and her rooms kind of right down the hallway from my locker in the same hallway so I guess I could talk to her
2156,high_051,counsellor,that sounds like a good option so that's our goal is to keep pushing cutting further down the list and to keep adding things that you're going to try first and you're right that the first thing you try might not bring you all the way down to a two or of three but it might bring you down a little bit and each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more so you have to be willing to try a few things can you do that
2157,high_051,client,I can but I really want like a cooler pencil though like like a cooler pencil so I don't know maybe maybe we could go look for a pencil together
2158,high_051,counsellor,I think that's a good idea
2159,high_051,client,okay I'd like that
2160,high_051,counsellor,okay thank you for answering all my questions on this you did a great job with this chain and I know it wasn't easy
2161,high_051,client,yeah you're welcome
2162,high_051,counsellor,let's go look for that pencil
2163,high_052,counsellor,look Carl how are you doing today
2164,high_052,client,oh good good area I'm doing well thanks for asking last week you were talking in therapy
2165,high_052,counsellor,yeah I mean and I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week but a joke I was telling you about Jill my coworker and you know she was kind of bothering me in the past couple weeks but really this this past week was like the worst right so she's not doing her paperwork and the thing is is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports so if she doesn't have hers I can't do mine and then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do their it's a mess the whole thing's a mess and it's just it's annoying me
2166,high_052,client,so her work slowdown would not be efficient work is affecting your work productivity
2167,high_052,counsellor,yeah yeah it definitely is and it it's one of those things that like you know has it gives me a bad a bad evaluation you know like it if I'm not eating my stuff in in time then it reflects negatively on me you know and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level you know and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time so she doesn't then I don't then the next person and so forth
2168,high_052,client,and it makes it seem like you're not doing your job
2169,high_052,counsellor,right yeah and my boss doesn't like it my boss's boss doesn't like it so forth you know and I try to explain to them you know she's the problem but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like here's what's happening or it just somehow it doesn't come out
2170,high_052,client,you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation
2171,high_052,counsellor,yeah and that's pretty annoying too because you know it's one thing if people get mad at me but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job like I'm supposed to but it's another thing for them to get me into me not realizing my fault you know
2172,high_052,client,you have an explanation for why the works that get done
2173,high_052,counsellor,yeah I did I do that's the thing but I can't always get it out you know I can't always tell the person that's has the complain about and yeah I mean I tried talking to my my boss and I tried talking other people too you know but really hasn't gotten anywhere
2174,high_052,client,so you're feeling stuck with this whole thing
2175,high_052,counsellor,yeah yeah I mean I talked to Jill a little bit about it too you know and I tried to ask I tried kind of gently reminding her you know like such-and-such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock yeah I didn't want to be real abrasive you know but I I tried to remind
2176,high_052,client,it was a polite approach
2177,high_052,counsellor,yeah yeah and it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening
2178,high_052,client,your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you wanted
2179,high_052,counsellor,no it really hasn't and and that's just I feel like I've tried everything that I could try you know and even like I came home and I was talking to a friend about it and I was trying to think of other solutions right you know I was trying to think like what else I could do what else I could say who else I could talk to things like that you know and I mean my friend you know he was listening in staffing had some good suggestions but it he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company so like I got nothing
2180,high_052,client,you're not getting help you need for this
2181,high_052,counsellor,yeah not at all feeling pretty lost with it and then I wish it was just like a clearer way to do things like this is what you should do now and I don't see anything
2182,high_052,client,some sort of clear plan
2183,high_052,counsellor,yeah yeah but I yeah I don't I don't see a way to go about it I mean I so I right so this is the way I lay down my mind I tried talking to the people above me mm-hmm didn't work out the way I thought it would I tried talking to the people below me so to speak just lower on the before me in the process that's what I mean and that didn't work out which it's just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work so like there's nowhere else I could turn
2184,high_052,client,the options are exhausted
2185,high_052,counsellor,yeah that's what it seems like to me
2186,high_052,client,and this is frustrating for you yeah it is and I've been trying to rack my brain you know like what else could I do you know like maybe if I could maybe if there was like a committee or something that I could go to you know and be like well this person's not doing what they're supposed to be different but there's not a committee like that or even if there was like a person you know like a resolution person or whatever but there's there's nobody like that
2187,high_052,counsellor,there's no other Avenue
2188,high_052,client,that's what it seems like to me yeah and you knows I'm even trying to think like I don't know should I write a letter to somebody maybe but I don't even know who or what
2189,high_052,counsellor,you've thought about a letter but who would you send it to
2190,high_052,client,yeah or like just something else that I could I can do instead of going to this person though that person that didn't work could I could I call us somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that but I mean there's there's HR people but that's I I can't really see where they could come in I don't know how Human Resources could deal with something like that
2191,high_052,counsellor,you don't view them as a potential solution
2192,high_052,client,wonder me if there's like a but there's I mean I'm thinking now that there's got to be something or somebody or somewhere that I could put in like almost like a complaint or something like something's out of my hands and I don't know what to do about it look there's got to be something and now that I'm saying this I'm thinking that there's got to be
2193,high_052,counsellor,some other resource you haven't tried yet
2194,high_052,client,yeah yeah and I mean now I'm trying to think back to my training you know initially you know what I think now that I'm now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about it a little bit differently about it I'm thinking that there's like man I forget what they call it now but maybe like a complaint but it's not the right word but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something and I think if I remember correctly those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting which we have like every other week
2195,high_052,counsellor,they're discussed at this regular meeting
2196,high_052,client,yeah and I'm I'm thinking now I mean nobody really uses it but I'm thinking like maybe that's an avenue that I can use you know and like maybe that'll get brought up and maybe that's something that then might actually work
2197,high_052,counsellor,this could be another option for you
2198,high_052,client,yeah it could be and then if it does work it'll get thrown and rather if they do read it it'll get brought up at the staff meeting where everybody's at my boss my boss's boss Jill everybody's there and maybe that's a way for it to come to everybody's attention that deadlines being missed affect other people in ways that you don't really know about
2199,high_052,counsellor,so everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way to help you
2200,high_052,client,maybe yeah I think that's I mean that's gotta be the way to do it and maybe that's the best way ever I really think yeah I mean after saying all that after going through that I really think that that's probably the best way to do it and if it if it doesn't and I guess I could find another way but I really think that's the best way to do it
2201,high_052,counsellor,you feel as though you found an option here
2202,high_052,client,yeah yeah and even if that doesn't work then it'll be brought up and maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it and maybe he'll understand really where I'm coming from but this will at least be a start to something you know how to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff
2203,high_052,counsellor,you are frustrated with all this
2204,high_052,client,yeah but maybe maybe after I do that you know put in the complaint or suggestion
2205,high_052,counsellor,mm-hmm
2206,high_052,client,maybe I won't be as frustrated I'm gonna feel a little bit less frustrated now even thinking if there is another opportunity
2207,high_052,counsellor,it feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here
2208,high_052,client,yeah yeah
2209,high_052,counsellor,well this might be a good place to wrap this session up that feels like the right move for you
2210,high_052,client,yeah
2211,high_052,counsellor,and well schedule so I see you next week and we can pick up from there
2212,high_052,client,sounds good
2213,high_052,counsellor,all right cool thanks Carl
2214,high_052,client,thank you
2215,high_053,counsellor,yes there it goes okay hi I'm Sheila I'll be your pharmacist today um first can you describe by your name and birth date
2216,high_053,client,um my name is carb and my I am 57 years old
2217,high_053,counsellor,okay that's good enough I just wanna make sure I have the right person and so I have three things for you today is that when you're expressing
2218,high_053,client,yes
2219,high_053,counsellor,okay I just wanted to take a minute and go through these with you all right okay great I was like - these are results for you we have the Lance's insulin which is your long-acting insulin and then we have the metformin catalyst cannot look like what you've been picking
2220,high_053,client,yes that's women taking
2221,high_053,counsellor,okay great and so I'm how do you be using these
2222,high_053,client,uh my metformin I take twice a day and then the insulin I just take in the evening
2223,high_053,counsellor,okay great and then on this it says 48 units are you still taking that much or
2224,high_053,client,yes for me
2225,high_053,counsellor,okay and have you noticed any side effects or any problems with these but I can help you in
2226,high_053,client,no the doctor says my diabetes isn't under control
2227,high_053,counsellor,okay all right well it looks like they decided to add another influence and so what this is is novalog which is also called a smart insulin looks like um this one is one that you're gonna actually I should rephrase that and what did your how did your doctor tell you to take this
2228,high_053,client,I guess I have to take that on before I eat carbohydrates
2229,high_053,counsellor,right okay great and um why did your doctor amasses
2230,high_053,client,um because my diabetes is on control teas done
2231,high_053,counsellor,alright okay great so um you're right you're going to use this with meals and you're going to actually try to get before you eat so that may be a little bit difficult because you're going to estimate how much carbohydrate you're going to eat before you actually eat it so it might be a little dicey at first um try to help you with that um what did your doctor tell you to expect with the medication
2232,high_053,client,um that the same thing that you said I'll have to do a certain amount of units for each amount a card
2233,high_053,counsellor,okay now with insulin there's some things that we'd like to that sometimes can be a problem too like hypoglycemia have you experience animal
2234,high_053,client,yeah I have a little bit
2235,high_053,counsellor,okay how have you been managed genius
2236,high_053,client,uh I eat like soda or drink soda sorry or like glucose tablets
2237,high_053,counsellor,oh okay great and usually keep something on you then okay it's going to be even more important now that you're going to be doing it so basically you're going to start with the one unit for 15 grams of carbohydrate and that might be a little bit abstract for you so I don't know if you've ever done carb counting before so I got you some information um this is just a general like nutrition facts thing that you would see on a food label
2238,high_053,client,okay
2239,high_053,counsellor,so they make it really easy for you guys it just says right here a total carbohydrate so this is per serving though so I wanted to draw your attention to the top where it says it's serving size is you might have to do a little bit math here like on this one a serving size is one ounce but there's four servings in there bad
2240,high_053,client,oh
2241,high_053,counsellor,if you ate the whole bag you would have to multiply this by 4
2242,high_053,client,so that'll be four carbs rather than one
2243,high_053,counsellor,umm right for a unit right because this is almost 15 or
2244,high_053,client,4 units
2245,high_053,counsellor,right so you would use for a units of insulin to cover a full bag of it so that's how you do the math
2246,high_053,client,okay
2247,high_053,counsellor,now unfortunately this is more of a general average and since you're just starting on it it's probably not going to be realistic so what you're going to want to do is monitor this monitor your blood sugar and any type of like thing you can sense that you have when you first start this is um mainly a really like a range and some people leave one unit for like 9 grams and cards and some people need one unit for like 30 grams of carbs so it's really going to be dependent on how sensitive you are to insulin
2248,high_053,client,so I might have to go up
2249,high_053,counsellor,yeah you might have to go up or down just depending on how you react so what I would suggest is keeping like a log with you I don't know if you're logging your blood sugar reading and like a paper log or if you're just keeping it in your letter
2250,high_053,client,in my meter yeah
2251,high_053,counsellor,yeah it might be good idea to have like a moment of madness you just when you get started so you can kind of figure out exactly how many units you need per amount of carbs just as far as what you respond to yeah
2252,high_053,client,okay
2253,high_053,counsellor,you know this is just another little thing about when you first start getting used to counting carbohydrates just grant information for you so um I know you've been on the Lantis and it's an injectable how have you been doing the injection
2254,high_053,client,um just in my belly that's that area punching the pan now are you using like the same area on your abdomen or do you kind of use different sauce I rotate it between each side
2255,high_053,counsellor,okay now that we're adding another influence you're going to be adding three more injections a day perhaps so I gave you a little chart here there are other places on your body that you can inject other than your abdomen so it might be a good idea because you really do want to rotate by Senora tation okay um so you're pretty familiar with how to use a syringe then
2256,high_053,client,yes
2257,high_053,counsellor,okay you have a sharps container at home to secure the needles great okay so just to refresh they're only going to be using a couple of units at a time with this so I'm each each mark on here is a one unit and it goes up to 50 so pretty easy at least it's not done by twos or anything
2258,high_053,client,right
2259,high_053,counsellor,okay um so we've gone over a lot of information and just to make sure I didn't leave anything out we've come through a lot of stuff here um can you just tell me how you're going to use these
2260,high_053,client,okay yeah um well my old medications I'm going to continue taking so I'm going to take the metformin twice a day and the nighttime insulin at night and then with the new one I'm going to take one unit for 15 grams of carbohydrates but rotate site so that I don't get any atrophy and then I'm going I think it's a good idea to keep that logbook and monitor my route post levels in case the doctor will need to adjust the dose of that
2261,high_053,counsellor,I think it's actually great and yeah I just wanted to maybe ask another question about um you know what kind of exercise habits we have or how is your blood pressure been I noticed that as far as what information I have it was a little high which is something it concerns us with diet medication so I would have even
2262,high_053,client,um well I have the back pain so I can't exercise that much and lately I just haven't been going to the nutritionist as often as I should
2263,high_053,counsellor,okay what kind of barriers are standing in the way of that
2264,high_053,client,my job I'm a principal I'm pretty busy this time of year
2265,high_053,counsellor,okay um as far as your back pain and what is the root cause of your family you know if it's like something that maybe a chiropractor or massage might help there's the low impact exercise maybe a hope it for you I don't know maybe you can bring it up your doctor or two or Long's we're gonna be getting on something like just walking or like a stationary bike or even swimming if any of those are things that you can implement it'd be a really good improvement come and anyone needs much insulin -
2266,high_053,client,oh okay
2267,high_053,counsellor,one other quick little thing is that um so insulin and your amount of exercising and activity kind of go hand-in-hand so if you start to exercise more all of a sudden you may need less insulin so once you get started on this and you know how much you're going to use per how many carbs it may change with you come around which is a good thing yeah but just keep in mind because you may have more hypoglycemic events if you don't alter
2268,high_053,client,it watch it but maybe I won't have to use as much
2269,high_053,counsellor,yeah exactly so what other questions you have for me
2270,high_053,client,um I just had one question I don't know if you'd answer this or the doctor but my eyesight oh if I get this if I use the insulin and get better control well my eyesight get better or shot getting is worse
2271,high_053,counsellor,um it should hopefully stay blind not get any worse I'm not sure if it will repair at all I don't think it will but it's best to stop it now you know I stopped their progression so the better control you have the better it should be as far as not getting worse but I've definitely something it's gonna be important - especially your occupation so so yeah getting under control - great a great thing
2272,high_053,client,okay thank you
2273,high_053,counsellor,all right well thank you very much and give me a call if anything comes up I have some more information for you here which is very much just what we've gone over but that we can write all right
2274,high_053,client,thanks
2275,high_054,counsellor,all right before our are you today
2276,high_054,client,I'm good how are you
2277,high_054,counsellor,I'm pretty good sons outshining makes me happy
2278,high_054,client,definitely very warm
2279,high_054,counsellor,thinking that wait so why are you here today it'll be a any specific reason sir
2280,high_054,client,Oh my doctor said I had type 2 diabetes so I don't really want to go on medication so
2281,high_054,counsellor,oh that's actually very common today with medications doing it by a natural healthy lifestyle so she said you have text red beans did she tell you anything about that or I will level are we right now with the understanding of what type 2 diabetes is
2282,high_054,client,well I know I had something to do with the insulin but she didn't really understand
2283,high_054,counsellor,well I'm here for you so what type 2 diabetes is is in your body that working called your pancreas secretes this insulin excrete hormone called insulin and what the insulin does is takes up the glucose that's in your blood it brings it into yourselves that they use for energy and in your case your body is still producing insulin but it's just not either producing enough or it's having trouble getting it into the cells for various reasons or you're producing it it's just not working your body loses insulin resistant right now so do you know why your cells need the glucose
2284,high_054,client,err
2285,high_054,counsellor,yes exactly it's due form of energy and your brain needs a minimum level of glucose to function along with all your other organs so by not getting that insulin or by not getting the glucose into yourselves there's some sense there's starving going to ketoacidosis a lot of complications can happen with that so it's very important to maintain blood glucose and control your Sugar's with a type 2 diabetes
2286,high_054,client,so that's why I've been so tired recently
2287,high_054,counsellor,yes that's a very good cause of it so yeah that's perfect so well let's talk about your daily routine in your diet and see how that plays into it right now so what do you do on a normal day or what times would she be okay
2288,high_054,client,well usually I just start breakfast eggs bacon
2289,high_054,counsellor,okay
2290,high_054,client,that for lunch they'll usually say like some deli meat bread
2291,high_054,counsellor,hybrid wait girl in purple and
2292,high_054,client,then for dinner on like pasta or some kind of poultry
2293,high_054,counsellor,okay so have you ever considered maybe trying to buy like different made whole grain bread or whole grain pasta
2294,high_054,client,yeah I mean we don't usually do it
2295,high_054,counsellor,okay okay so you know that you need to not control your blood glucose levels right to maintain the healthy lifestyle so what are your goal is to try and do that or why why would you want to do that
2296,high_054,client,well I don't really do much exercising my husband you know sometimes their dog so
2297,high_054,counsellor,yeah
2298,high_054,client,okay
2299,high_054,counsellor,so and then the exercise that's going to help by reducing the adipose tissue around your cells which will make it easier for the insulin to pick up the glucose and bring it into your cells so losing weight is always a key part in maintaining diet or helping to control diabetes and even if you're not necessarily using weight doing the exercise one really help you gain more muscle mass which what is the bad news and both is just another word for fat is it late with that around yourselves adipose tissue is that too soon yeah so okay so we've gone over some brainstorming ideas so let's pick some two or three things that we can really focus on so for next time maybe we can hopefully see a little luck because um before I said the doctor happened to give you a glucose meter do you know what that is or
2300,high_054,client,know that when you pick your finger
2301,high_054,counsellor,that is what are you prick you maker yes and that will tell you what your blood glucose is so remind me at the end of thing and we can give you one of those if that sounds like a good option and then we can start having blood glucose readings and that will also manage your blood sugar that's a way to
2302,high_054,client,how about help
2303,high_054,counsellor,well that will let you know where your blood glucose is so say in the mornings generally your blood who was this putting much lower because you've gone all night not having anything to eat you're gonna start the day fresh but at night it's kind of obvious that you've got all day you're eating you're tired your body's gone through a rough day your blood Sugar's public we're generally much more higher so if we have glucose readings say next time when you come in we can say see where you're at see if they're generally starting to decrease of what we're doing is helping or not and then you can go from there always and hopefully that will help so you won't have to run the medicine
2304,high_054,client,okay what would be a good range question
2305,high_054,counsellor,usually we want to try and keep your blood Sugar's under 100 and especially in the morning waking up not having anything in your system. I know 100 be a good number. at night of course it's going to be a little bit higher so 120 80 would say we're trying to keep anything under there. and you know what if you mess up and they're higher that's okay because things happen. you may have wanted to go to a party that day eat a cake you know anything so things are going to fluctuate. but if we come back and you generally have lower glucose that's as much that's very good sign much better for your body. so so okay so I'll call these pretty serving things. what do you think we can what are like two or three main things that you choose that you will focus on
2306,high_054,client,okay well I think testing is pretty important then I could definitely try to exercise more because I haven't really been doing much of that
2307,high_054,counsellor,right right
2308,high_054,client,and then I maybe the whole grains too
2309,high_054,counsellor,yeah and you always don't have to switch by it over either we can say go to the grocery store this time by white bread the next time I buy whole wheat bread or make your pasta half white half wheat things like that under sandwiches maybe one slice of white bread once it's we brighten everything up whatever work for you and also does your husband eat well or
2310,high_054,client,I mean we pretty much the same nothing right cooking
2311,high_054,counsellor,okay so that's perfect do you think it's a good support
2312,high_054,client,I can try to get
2313,high_054,counsellor,yeah exactly and you know what maintaining your health and maintaining his health is just going to better the both of you anyway so it's always nice to have someone to help support you and what you're doing and going on the walks
2314,high_054,client,okay
2315,high_054,counsellor,and if instead of staying or going on a walk everyday maybe you can go every other day with him but it's a learning process so you don't have to jump into everything right away as long as you're taking the initiative now and trying that's always what's gonna help so if it goes wrong it is okay so let's go back and summarize what we've decided you know some be the three goals that
2316,high_054,client,we've shared more pool greens more exercise
2317,high_054,counsellor,okay perfect and do you what times do you think will work good for testing for you or do you have an idea of how you'll like keep a journal maybe or
2318,high_054,client,so I can keep the journal I'm more of a morning person
2319,high_054,counsellor,okay
2320,high_054,client,Chuck Tesla
2321,high_054,counsellor,in the morning and then you'll know what you are for the day you go from there they said that sounds good to me so you seem very motivated and excited like you want to get better and that's always a good sign
2322,high_054,client,I definitely want to stick around a long time for
2323,high_054,counsellor,I agree that's yeah it's a mingle a lot of people healthy lifestyle so okay do you plan on coming back and see an appointment for next time or
2324,high_054,client,yeah that's a really good checkup
2325,high_054,counsellor,okay does three months okay and that way we can give you a long time because well look at your anyone see again your anyone see is a measure of how sticky your blood is basically and so it's a three month measure so you would take it two or three months it'll tell you how much sugar and stuff on to the red blood cells of your body basically so we can see if it's higher or lower it'll tell how you're doing and so
2326,high_054,client,okay
2327,high_054,counsellor,that would be a good indicator where you're at next time I see you
2328,high_054,client,okay
2329,high_054,counsellor,so thank you for coming in today Jamie
2330,high_055,counsellor,you in summary the minnesota state mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday cited for driving under the influence and then you are transported to detox plus you're only 21 years old is the report accurate
2331,high_055,client,I guess so I don't really remember much like those a week ago so I was kind of drawn to
2332,high_055,counsellor,ok behavior like this could get you suspended doesn't that concern you
2333,high_055,client,mm-hmm I mean not really I'm gonna be 21 in a couple months I'm potentially alone the cops came to me a minor I mean I'm not a heavy drinker like like my friends or anything I don't get wasted at all and I just hey be careful I just won't get caught I'm just trying to find like a normal college student
2334,high_055,counsellor,what were you thinking when you got into your car after having six beers you could have caused an accident and killed somebody
2335,high_055,client,whatever I didn't know I called my roommates for a ride you sleepy so idea home somehow and this is name of my fault I can ride all the time but I didn't do anything
2336,high_055,counsellor,you need to take responsibility for your actions do you keep partying like this your problems will only get worse you're likely to face costly legal citations for grades health problems getting kicked out of school and disappointing your parents you don't want that to happen do you
2337,high_055,client,no no like I said this is my fault like are we done here have class in 15 minutes
2338,high_055,counsellor,your behavior is now a Minnesota State University expects of its students if you want to be a student here you'll need to show that you're able to follow our rules do you think you can do that otherwise you'll be suspended
2339,high_055,client,look I really like corn I miss you and I gilja sand you you're making some really good points and i'll think about them okay
2340,high_055,counsellor,okay well your sanction is you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend an alcohol education seminar that will cost you one hundred and fifty dollars also disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer
2341,high_055,client,$150 are you serious I can't pay that all right I'm done with those I'm good
2342,high_055,counsellor,"In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you are stopped on Stadium Road last Friday. Excited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. Plus the report lists your age as twenty Dillon. What is the accuracy of the report and can you share with me some details leading up to the incident?"
2343,high_055,client,I guess that sounds that sounds right I mean I was kind of drunk and it happened like a week ago. I just I drove over to my friends house just to go watch the game and you know we're having a couple beers and X and O the Vikings accountabilities in pretty big so we drank a little bit more than usual. and I mean at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride so I just rolled.
2344,high_055,counsellor,you decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing and when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home you decided to drive yourself home did I get that right
2345,high_055,client,yeah that's exactly how it happened I mean I'm a normal college kid I had to drink in a house and buddies I mean it wasn't a big house party or anything that got busted
2346,high_055,counsellor,yeah I understand that your intention would have a good time while watching the game with your friends you didn't think about what could go wrong when you drink alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home
2347,high_055,client,and I tried to be safe I mean I tried to call her roommate but I am getting in trouble anyways
2348,high_055,counsellor,"Dawn, you told me what brought you here today. What do you think the problem really is?"
2349,high_055,client,um let's say I have a drinking problem I think I probably have more of a like getting caught problem I mean my friends they drink like fishes and I they don't ever get caught and you got me over here and I get caught and left
2350,high_055,counsellor,sounds like you attribute your current situation a bad luck if that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior what consequences might result
2351,high_055,client,I guess I got some more problems with police in school I really don't have like the time or the money for any of that
2352,high_055,counsellor,how important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school villain
2353,high_055,client,it's just super important because just just going to detox alone was was awful the experience I don't want to do that again and my dad said if I get suspended from school I'll have to have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social I don't see any of my friends and I mean it's already bad enough like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI
2354,high_055,counsellor,yeah what would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended
2355,high_055,client,well yes I I guess the easy one is I want to drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more likely to get in trouble so probably I don't want to drink so much
2356,high_055,counsellor,on a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with ten being very confident
2357,high_055,client,I guess I would say like I don't like over halfway is so maybe like a sex
2358,high_055,counsellor,what steps could you take to move that six or seven or eight
2359,high_055,client,I could probably I guess well it's the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so then I'm not risking myself to drive very like if I go out to a party waiting to like I'm 21 to drink maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking like I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do the just drink
2360,high_055,counsellor,In what ways might your life be better if you succeed in making the changes you mentioned?
2361,high_055,client,um I mean I guess the big one would be like I went I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8 a.m. then well even even when I make it to my 8 a.m.'s now like I just I sleep like I wake up I'm like oh my god what's going on and then I get to my 8 a.m. and I'll just sleep through and then I'm this just about everything that's on the test so I think if I if I reprioritize what is important to me it probably helped me succeed I mean in high school I had a 3.5 GPA is I know I could do it here
2362,high_055,counsellor,College is all about making choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision making? How do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking?
2363,high_055,client,um I mean education is really important to me and and also my family talking about it and I really I really want to be an international journalist to be on the news like I mean I have the face for it so I guess if I reprioritize mind if I read prioritize what I need to do like and I won't drink so much I probably want to be disappointing my parents and I'd be able to get a really good education
2364,high_055,counsellor,thanks for coming in for participating today your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150 RS
2365,high_055,client,Oh what is the seminar
2366,high_056,counsellor,great session today Brian you're really making great improvements in all the areas that we've been focusing on you know you've met all your goals that we set for you when you initially came in and I think you're just about ready to be discharged great so I'd like to take the last couple of minutes of today's session to try and make sure we carry over the results that we made in physical therapy into your daily schedule
2367,high_056,client,okay
2368,high_056,counsellor,this will help keep your body strong resilience outside of the clinic so that hopefully your previous recording there's a back pain do not return okay so before we do this I'd like to read explore why you sought out physical therapy in the first place okay does it sound okay to you
2369,high_056,client,yeah it does you know the you know ever since the new year I've been trying to get back into you know being more active and playing basketball and all that stuff but I've been seems like I'm hitting a wall quite a bit
2370,high_056,counsellor,okay
2371,high_056,client,I have a lot of obstacles and having trouble getting through it
2372,high_056,counsellor,okay well tell me more about the kinds of things that you were doing and why he seems to be hitting these road bumps along the way
2373,high_056,client,so as you as you know my buddy's been playing you know basketball pickup and I've been trying to do trying to do that and that caused me some back pain in the past and it's been a struggle for me to do that so I went to doctor and the doctor gave me some some pain medication and the pain medication worked for for a while but it seemed like it didn't really take care of it so then I started I try I try to try to do basketball again but then I had more pain from that so I'm really stuck with it with going back to basketball because it's a pain
2374,high_056,counsellor,well it sounds like you you've really struggled that back get back into a more active lifestyle and understand how difficult it is to overcome these roadblocks and INSAT all over again so tell me everything else is going are you eating well sleeping well are there any other stressors in your life
2375,high_056,client,well I have been trying to eat better but it's been quite difficult to maintain for a pro for a long period of time work is getting busier and I'm getting closer to about six hours a night but three things definitely isn't the best for me you know I feel much better when I'm exercising but when this back pain calmed on everything just seems to fall apart and definitely makes me less active
2376,high_056,counsellor,well you did have some success and you felt much better when you initially tried to become more active
2377,high_056,client,yeah I did I definitely felt a lot better felt like I was like turning a new chapter in my life and I'd like to think that I would being more proactive about my health
2378,high_056,counsellor,okay well it sounds like you realized that when you started to change these aspects of your life you felt much better and that it was going to affect your overall health but it's recurring back pain that you experienced was stopping you in your tracks so tell me what do you think that you're experiencing these recurring bouts of back pain in the first place
2379,high_056,client,"I don't think I was in the proper physical shape to be playing basketball you know with my friends you know. I said that at a desk for about eight hours a day and I go from there to play in basketball. The rest and the medications didn't have some positive effects initially but it seemed like they were not helping overall. Yes, a pain came right back."
2380,high_056,counsellor,I think I think you're right you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem it sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a stress and that something needs to change. There are many other things that play into why pain comes about for example how much stress you're under your productivity level much sleep you're getting your emotional health they all play a big role as well. You know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain. I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pick-up basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day. Does this make sense to you?
2381,high_056,client,yes I definitely think so I mean working eight hours a day and going to play basketball my body was
2382,high_056,counsellor,definitely not ready for that definitely you know because many factors influence we have a lot of options on how to decrease pain and make sure that it doesn't return now you're doing very well about being proactive about getting back into a more active lifestyle but I think that the physical capability good body just wasn't there yet to jump into playing basketball with your friends at that intensity and I think that was a big reason why you experience back pain in the first place and also why it's been recurring what's your impression on that
2383,high_056,client,well I definitely understand that you know I really haven't exercised in a couple years and because everything's been pretty crazy at home very hectic lots of hours at home or kids have been busy things that in the job is very busy just hectic I thought playing basketball be great for me I think it is but I definitely wasn't ready to step right back in and I didn't realize my body needed more more preparedness to give into that
2384,high_056,counsellor,you have to think of your body is a complex ecosystem where a number of different factors mixed to create your pain you know as we touched on before things like how much stress you're under your emotional health your beliefs and aggravating activities in your case basketball they all come into play so we really don't know exactly how pain is influenced by all of these different factors but we do know that it's very helpful to address many areas of your life but as we spoke about before these factors all interrelate so when it hurts you stop exercising which changes your general wellness your mood and your social supports and so on and so forth but it's important to note though that things can change you know so we can start with your activities you know what do you think that you can do in order to be more physically active but reduce the risk of the back pain returning and the additional negative effects that accompany that
2385,high_056,client,well I guess I could go for short walks with my wife after work definitely be less stress on my body and be some type of exercise for me in terms of work it would make sense if I got up once in a while from my chair and just walk around that would make sense and it'd be good for me
2386,high_056,counsellor,great it sounds like we're off to a great start it's important to note though that there are many different exercises that can help you you know you need to gradually expose yourself to increasingly demanding tasks you know we start with walking let your body adapt as you have been locked tolerance you can keep moving forward so let me ask you how important is it to you to improve your consistency with exercise in order to enhance your health
2387,high_056,client,yeah certainly I definitely feel that consistency is important I'm tired of starting and stopping starting and stopping I definitely want to be more consistent
2388,high_056,counsellor,brilliant you've got it consistency is key you know so how how often do you think that you'll be able to exercise
2389,high_056,client,well my wife walks four or five times a week and each time she walks is about thirty minutes I could probably do that also at work I think I could get up and walk around every up you know these once every hour
2390,high_056,counsellor,sounds like a brilliant start so let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero being not confident at all and ten being 100% confident how confident are you that you will be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime
2391,high_056,client,I would probably say about a six or seven
2392,high_056,counsellor,but you're not a zero that tells me you've got some confidence in making a change so let me ask you why are you confident you know
2393,high_056,client,as I said before I'm tired of starting stopping and I'm just tired that and I also I think I could lose I could use to lose a few pounds
2394,high_056,counsellor,okay so you realize that if you become more consistent with exercise and moving Moore's work you're going to feel better and you're held to be impacted positively
2395,high_056,client,yes I definitely think so
2396,high_056,counsellor,but you're not a 10 that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a 10 or even an eight or a nine
2397,high_056,client,"I think if I give my whole family involved that will certainly help. Also if I can set, you know, small realistic goals for myself, I think that will keep me motivated. You know, in the past, you know, like we talked about a few times already, that you know I'm always stopping and starting. I think if I do those things I won't do that. And also I think that I'll stay more motivated. And there to help you probably lead myself to better healthier lifestyle."
2398,high_056,counsellor,"Brilliant. I get the impression that you want to stay on course with starting an exercise regime and experience in less pain. The best way to do this is, as we said, staying consistent and setting small goals for yourself to keep motivated. You know your ecosystem will adapt to be more active and you slowly begin to do more and your pain will slowly begin to subside. During this progression, it's important to note as well to keep slowly building up and not to put a limit on what you can do later down the road. As I sort of build confidence and increase the strength and resiliency of your body. So if I saw you in two weeks, what would you tell me with regards to how your new exercise regime is going?"
2399,high_056,client,I will tell you that I'm consistent I will tell you I'm feeling much better I'll tell you I would probably have little pain if any and I'll tell you I'm more active in an overall I just tell you I'm very healthy
2400,high_056,counsellor,good good sounds brilliant you know so using that same scale from zero to ten how confident are you that you'll be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime
2401,high_056,client,definitely attend definitely
2402,high_056,counsellor,I agree you know overall most comments in your brain. Let's see you in two weeks. Crazy idea.
2403,high_056,client,okay perfect thank you
2404,high_057,counsellor,I was Jones nice to see you again
2405,high_057,client,doctor how are you today
2406,high_057,counsellor,"I'm doing great things now. We have about 15 minutes today and I want to make sure that we talk about what's important to you. However, I do want to take some time at the beginning to talk about your recent lab work. Would that be okay?"
2407,high_057,client,oh definitely I mean I guess that's something I should be concerned about with you bringing it up I knew my blood pressure so going up a little bit but I didn't know anything else was a concern
2408,high_057,counsellor,the blood sugars have increased some so you're concerned that things are not as good as they were last time that we talked
2409,high_057,client,yeah that's right I did notice that my morning blood sugars were coming up a little bit I just didn't realize how serious it was
2410,high_057,counsellor,right why I'd certainly didn't mean to startle you but there has been a significant increase in your that a1c that three-month average on your blood sugar yeah so that's gone from you've been doing so great we'd brought it down from over 9 to about 7.5 and now it's kind of bounced back up to 8.4 and I'm wondering if you had any ideas as to why that might have happened
2411,high_057,client,well you know I was reading about the januvia that we added and read some concerning things on the internet it might cause pancreatitis and cancer and I just was scared to death of that so I stopped taking my medication I guess I should have told you about that
2412,high_057,counsellor,um telling me would have been great but that's okay I mean you had a concern about a medication that you dread some things about and you stopped the medication I think that's a good thing that's a good decision
2413,high_057,client,wow I'm glad to know you're not too angry with me you know we're not I've read that cancer was a possibility it just terrified me because my mother had died of breast cancer and I just didn't want any of that
2414,high_057,counsellor,how long ago was that
2415,high_057,client,oh it's it's been a little while but it was the tough process and I certainly don't want to see myself there
2416,high_057,counsellor,so the concern of cancer was probably the main thing that me
2417,high_057,client,yes
2418,high_057,counsellor,but stop the medication
2419,high_057,client,well and you know - sometimes I didn't feel so good when you know the new medication combines with the metformin that I was on sometimes I would be nauseous and just uncomfortable
2420,high_057,counsellor,so you were nauseated anything else
2421,high_057,client,Oh sometimes diarrhea and sometimes the nausea was so bad even one day I didn't go to work
2422,high_057,counsellor,so quite a bit of nausea the diarrhea and then you also have that fear of cancer
2423,high_057,client,yes
2424,high_057,counsellor,um how are you feeling now
2425,high_057,client,well you know I guess my thoughts are that if I don't have to take so much medication you know that would make me feel better too many pills you know I just feel like I shouldn't be taking so much medication but obviously we do have to do something about the blood sugar
2426,high_057,counsellor,tell me what you know about the consequences of having high blood sugars that are untreated
2427,high_057,client,well I know you know in reading on the internet and doing my research certainly could end up blind or on dialysis and I know some people have even lost limbs that's really scary to me I don't want that either
2428,high_057,counsellor,so on the one hand there are some things that really scare you about having diabetes that's uncontrolled and on the other hand it's been difficult for you I know we've talked in the past about working on controlling your your diet and looking at your way so where does that leave you at this point
2429,high_057,client,well I guess if I don't want to take more pills I have to give up some of my sweets my cookies and my potato chips
2430,high_057,counsellor,so those types of sweets and crunchy stuff and salty stuff is is pretty important to you
2431,high_057,client,yeah I'm a snacker unfortunately and it's always been hard that was my downfall every time I've tried to dye it before giving up the carbs was just so hard for me
2432,high_057,counsellor,so some of the problems you've had in the past you've had some failures you you've tried something tummy tell me a little bit more about some of the things that you've tried already
2433,high_057,client,well you know I've tried to Adkins in the past and it actually worked for me for a little while once I got used to it but then I just felt sluggish like I had no energy and and even kind of felt depressed
2434,high_057,counsellor,so you felt fatigued and somewhat depressed while you were on the Atkins diet that's something I hear not yeah pretty it's pretty often I think that if it's okay we could talk about that for a minute if that's something
2435,high_057,client,sure I'd like that
2436,high_057,counsellor,so carbohydrates actually do make us feel better they actually raise something called serotonin
2437,high_057,client,no wonder I like them so much
2438,high_057,counsellor,all right have you heard of serotonin
2439,high_057,client,yes I had
2440,high_057,counsellor,asked kind of a happy horn but yeah so as we do eat simple carbohydrates in particular those raise our serotonin levels so that we actually do feel better and so some people on the Atkins diet actually do feel depressed and fatigued because their serotonin levels aren't as high but that can be a dangerous cycle because as we raise our blood sugar you know we feel good if it's a simple sugar though blood sugar goes up insulin goes up we tend to crash we tend to eat more which tends to do the cycle of carbohydrate cravings
2441,high_057,client,so that's why I crave that bag of potato chips
2442,high_057,counsellor,I think I
2443,high_057,client,don't make sense
2444,high_057,counsellor,yeah so um what sort of things can you think about that could maybe calm those blood sugar swings down
2445,high_057,client,Wow I guess that I don't know enough about nutrition and diet I guess I need more information you know food has always been a comfort thing for me my family gets together we have big meals around the holidays so you know it's hard when you give up those things that you really love to stay focused so I guess that need more information
2446,high_057,counsellor,sounds like there's a lot of emotional investment for you and your family around food that can make things more difficult and that those may be some barriers that we need to talk about if it's okay would it be alright if we talked a little bit more about some of the other low carb diets that are out there
2447,high_057,client,sure
2448,high_057,counsellor,and what do you know about low carb diets can you you know if any that come to mind
2449,high_057,client,well I think I've heard about South Beach and of course Adkins that we mentioned um are there others
2450,high_057,counsellor,there are there's a couple out there one called protein power but a lot of my patients have had a lot of luck with South Beach diet wouldn't be already I'm
2451,high_057,client,sure I'd like that
2452,high_057,counsellor,well early on in the South Beach the first two weeks is called phase one and that's a very low carb time but during that time carbohydrate cravings people tell me typically really really calm down but even in that first phase in South Beach you can have again healthy salads and healthy carbohydrates then you kind of build on up and even in level two there are some actually healthy cookie recipes
2453,high_057,client,oh wow that's exciting
2454,high_057,counsellor,so in a limited state we may be able to give you some of your cookies back mmm so shown
2455,high_057,client,um I just might can try this
2456,high_057,counsellor,so on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready to make a change zero being really not ready at all where do you think you are at this point
2457,high_057,client,well you know I I think I'm a nine I think you know I really don't want to take the medication I'm afraid of cancer and other side effects from too many meds I've got to do something about the blood sugar spikes and what you're telling me I'm outside South Beach sounds like maybe I can do that
2458,high_057,counsellor,that sounds like you're fairly ready to do something that's good and how do you think will deal with some of these carbohydrate cravings
2459,high_057,client,Wow well I guess I need a support group I need you know somebody I can turn to when I'm having a tough day and also more information about the snacks I can't have that will make me healthier
2460,high_057,counsellor,right okay so one of the great things about South Beach is I think it's for $7.99 a month or something like that you can get tied in and have your own registered dietician did you have regular appointments with
2461,high_057,client,that would be awesome
2462,high_057,counsellor,yeah and they can help you through recipes and and also give you some strategies on the carbohydrate cravings so does that make sense
2463,high_057,client,sounds like a plan I really am excited about this as a possibility
2464,high_057,counsellor,okay well you're you're obviously a very inquisitive and intelligent lady and I think you'll have good success with this the other thing that we can offer is we do have a weight management support group here at the practice that meets on a weekly basis and I think quite a few of those folks are also doing the the South Beach so having some of that social facilitation may help as well is that something you think we might be interested in
2465,high_057,client,yes I think that would be great
2466,high_057,counsellor,Miss Jones you had said that uh maybe your confidence level wasn't too great because of some of the failures and kind of stop starts that you'd had in the past so if I can use another one of those scales on a confidence 0 being no confidence at all that you can do this or 10 being very confident you can do this where do you think you are in terms of
2467,high_057,client,Stefan maybe even an eighth that this will work for me this time I'm feeling better
2468,high_057,counsellor,tell me more about why a 7 or an 8 and not 4 or 5
2469,high_057,client,the support-group sound great the the website with the diet and the recipes and all of the things to support me in doing this and if the South Beach diet is going to help me with my carb cravings this might work
2470,high_057,counsellor,"Good, so it sounds like we have a plan. If it's ok, I'll again give you this information sheet that has the website information and costs and that sort of thing. We'll give you the information on the weight management support group. And there's even some information on exercise there if that's something that you're interested in at some point. And if it's ok, we'll see you back in 2 or 3 weeks. Is there a day you might change that would be best for you to start this diet?"
2471,high_057,client,well I need a little time to buy the right foods and read up on the the diet and information and the recipes maybe Monday would be good
2472,high_057,counsellor,so Monday very good it sounds like we have a plan
2473,high_057,client,right thank you doctor
2474,high_057,counsellor,thank you for your time and we'll see you in several weeks
2475,high_057,client,ok
2476,high_057,counsellor,bye
2477,high_058,counsellor,hi-oh Vina how are you doing today it's good to see you
2478,high_058,client,I'm just tired
2479,high_058,counsellor,just tired
2480,high_058,client,yeah
2481,high_058,counsellor,you know we did some pre-visit planning with you and your phq-2 which is a short depression screen was actually positive so we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool which is a phq-9 and that actually did come up with a score of 8 which is in the mild depression range so how does that how does that feel
2482,high_058,client,well I knew I felt different I didn't know I was depressed
2483,high_058,counsellor,but you knew something was something was wrong
2484,high_058,client,I didn't feel like myself or have it and feeling like myself no
2485,high_058,counsellor,tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself
2486,high_058,client,when I just go to work and I come home and I sleep I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired I just have no energy
2487,high_058,counsellor,so you sleep a lot but even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested
2488,high_058,client,no not at all
2489,high_058,counsellor,doesn't sound like good quality sleep
2490,high_058,client,no I just have no energy I don't want to do anything but just sleep
2491,high_058,counsellor,how long has that been going on
2492,high_058,client,hmm I guess a couple months
2493,high_058,counsellor,2 or 3 months
2494,high_058,client,yeah
2495,high_058,counsellor,what else is going on w-
2496,high_058,client,well you know I been drinking more I drink socially but I find myself that when I come home you know I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep
2497,high_058,counsellor,and that's worrisome to you
2498,high_058,client,it is cuz I don't usually drink that often during the week so it's increased yeah
2499,high_058,counsellor,yeah I can see where that would be bothersome to you what else what else is going on with you
2500,high_058,client,well you know my mom died a year ago so Mother's Day is coming up so you never think about mom a lot I miss her a lot
2501,high_058,counsellor,that anniversary is is close
2502,high_058,client,yeah
2503,high_058,counsellor,that's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents that's a that's a very difficult time
2504,high_058,client,yeah and I took care of mom so that's hard because for a long time well she was sick and she died from cancer so I took care of her so for a long time that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was so now that she's gone it just kind of brings up everything all over again
2505,high_058,counsellor,it's kind of a hole in your life
2506,high_058,client,yeah we were really close
2507,high_058,counsellor,I'm really sorry for your loss and thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's I know that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued.
2508,high_058,client,yeah I'm
2509,high_058,counsellor,just kind of going through the motions it sounds like during the day and then how's your appetite been
2510,high_058,client,I'm not really eating that much you know so I have energy you know before I would come home cook dinner or you know meet some friends after work but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine just go to bed
2511,high_058,counsellor,so you used to be more socially involved than you are now
2512,high_058,client,yeah don't do anything now
2513,high_058,counsellor,a little more isolated
2514,high_058,client,yeah just working come home and sleep
2515,high_058,counsellor,so if there was something that you could do about this what do you think you might like to do
2516,high_058,client,well I don't want to stay like this this isn't Who I am you know just sleeping all the time this is I don't want to stay this way
2517,high_058,counsellor,kind of feels like you're stuck
2518,high_058,client,yes
2519,high_058,counsellor,at this point
2520,high_058,client,yeah I just don't want to do anything or go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep I don't want to do that
2521,high_058,counsellor,it's kind of the same old routine um I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression
2522,high_058,client,okay
2523,high_058,counsellor,like you would that be alright most of the time we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer so no medication at this point
2524,high_058,client,no
2525,high_058,counsellor,all right then I think as important certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that
2526,high_058,client,I'm okay with that you know when Mom was sick you know she was in hospice care so she had cancer and the nurses and the doctors you know had our family talked to someone you know about what we were feeling you know
2527,high_058,counsellor,so that was the face pretty good experience
2528,high_058,client,yeah yeah to talk to someone that understood what we were going through
2529,high_058,counsellor,sure something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product there are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate and those that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those
2530,high_058,client,maybe something natural exercise I don't have energy I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything so I know I'm not going to exercise right now but if it's something that's natural you know I can maybe try that
2531,high_058,counsellor,okay if it's okay let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute and then we can hit some of those other things too
2532,high_058,client,okay
2533,high_058,counsellor,so um is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death is she someone who's out in the community
2534,high_058,client,she was really nice for me yeah I liked her so
2535,high_058,counsellor,it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that could you say on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready zero being not ready at all how ready would you be to do some counselling
2536,high_058,client,maybe like a six or seven so a six or seven
2537,high_058,counsellor,Y a six or seven and not a four or a five well
2538,high_058,client,because I don't want to stay like this and you know I've already talked to her before she was really nice so I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know when I saw her last time if ever needed I could come back
2539,high_058,counsellor,so it sounds like you've got a connection there already that's really good
2540,high_058,client,yeah
2541,high_058,counsellor,um does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that
2542,high_058,client,yeah I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again
2543,high_058,counsellor,okay
2544,high_058,client,yeah
2545,high_058,counsellor,well that's okay then it would be all right if we talked a little bit about the exercise I know you said that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine only you can make those decisions Alvina but if it's okay I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain
2546,high_058,client,okay
2547,high_058,counsellor,Exercises is again a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants.
2548,high_058,client,okay I didn't know that
2549,high_058,counsellor,yeah it actually raises serotonin have you heard about serotonin
2550,high_058,client,yeah
2551,high_058,counsellor,It's kind of the happy hormone yes so um it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF which is well it doesn't really matter what it is but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself so exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly and in actually improving the quality of sleep how does that sound at this point
2552,high_058,client,well if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again does that mean I have to run the medication right now we can try that
2553,high_058,counsellor,absolutely again those are yours to sit your decisions and I'm I'm here to really support you in those so if those sound like things that you might be willing to do I'm I'm all for it
2554,high_058,client,well I'll try then let's go on the medication
2555,high_058,counsellor,okay
2556,high_058,client,I have some friends they exercise and workout that I could probably call and exercise with them
2557,high_058,counsellor,so you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program
2558,high_058,client,yeah
2559,high_058,counsellor,is that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group
2560,high_058,client,yeah I have friends that run and friends that go to gym I have some friends that walk after work
2561,high_058,counsellor,so it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do
2562,high_058,client,yeah
2563,high_058,counsellor,which of those tend to interest you most
2564,high_058,client,well then also you know my church on the weekends they have exercise classes too so yeah but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away
2565,high_058,counsellor,very good well I think it sounds like this is important for you to to feel better and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan how do you see this fitting into your life at this point again kind of getting back to the counseling and and the exercise
2566,high_058,client,well when I saw her I could see her after work so I can call her and see if I can still see her after work for therapy and exercise I mean I can do that you know after work or on the weekends my friends they exercise various time so yeah
2567,high_058,counsellor,let's talk a little bit more about that you're say on a scale of if we can do use another one of those scales zero being confident that you could start an exercise program zero being not very confident at all in 10 being very confident tell me where you are in this exercise thing
2568,high_058,client,honestly maybe a five
2569,high_058,counsellor,okay
2570,high_058,client,"I'll try it Anything I have to do so that I don't have to go on medication, then I'll try it"
2571,high_058,counsellor,okay that sounds like a pretty strong commitment
2572,high_058,client,yes I'll try it
2573,high_058,counsellor,okay and tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point then
2574,high_058,client,well you know my friends have been calling but you know I'm just sleeping all the time so when they call them sleep so I haven't really called them back but I know I can just return their calls and just let them know I'll want to meet up with them and you know at least maybe just start walking
2575,high_058,counsellor,I think that's a great decision you have a couple of friends in mind that you could call
2576,high_058,client,yeah real close close friends that live not too far from me yeah
2577,high_058,counsellor,so tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise
2578,high_058,client,well I probably shouldn't come home I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friends house after work and change with her
2579,high_058,counsellor,so it would be difficult to do it in the morning you don't see that happening
2580,high_058,client,no because it's so hard when I get up in the room so tired that I can't I can't say doing in the morning
2581,high_058,counsellor,you think it would be easier to do it after work
2582,high_058,client,cuz I'm already out yeah as long as I don't come home so I come on Monica's sleep
2583,high_058,counsellor,come home it's over
2584,high_058,client,yeah yeah
2585,high_058,counsellor,all right well good it sounds like we have a plan for the counselor and when you check out today I will put this in your record and that will want to get in touch with the counselor that you work with when your mom was going through
2586,high_058,client,okay
2587,high_058,counsellor,her passing in the grief situation and then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program
2588,high_058,client,okay I'll try that
2589,high_058,counsellor,all right and if it's okay I'd like to call you in a week to one see how you're feeling and to the exercise is helping. you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial you may actually look forward to it because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood. and then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things. now we've talked about exercise apartment we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point. but I want you to know you know you can call anytime and I will work to get you in and that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working.
2590,high_058,client,okay
2591,high_059,counsellor,Oh so how are you today
2592,high_059,client,not bad I guess Thanks pretty good actually yeah
2593,high_059,counsellor,well let me introduce myself properly my name's Colin I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients who are thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you by what name would you prefer mr. Jones
2594,high_059,client,no no I'm I'm Nathan I mean Nate well Nate and my friends call me Nathan so so
2595,high_059,counsellor,well you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that but sure thinking about that as a coach would would help
2596,high_059,client,yeah
2597,high_059,counsellor,so I wondered it to get started if as a few things that we just lay out before we get going
2598,high_059,client,yeah
2599,high_059,counsellor,so my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and I do want to point out that anything that you say to us will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly I do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that that it sounds as though you rather put yourself at risk imminent risk or putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that
2600,high_059,client,okay
2601,high_059,counsellor,is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about
2602,high_059,client,no I I understand it sounds good I mean I understand so yeah yeah
2603,high_059,counsellor,well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone when we're doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you brings you here
2604,high_059,client,well I've kind of been messing up the last little while and I've kind of gotten myself into some trouble because because of that
2605,high_059,counsellor,tell me more about that
2606,high_059,client,well I'm sorry I'm a bit nervous sir
2607,high_059,counsellor,"Sure, it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this."
2608,high_059,client,yeah okay well I've had some job interviews and I've kind of I've missed those and and you know I've really not been too happy with myself the last little while you know I'm kind of getting angry really quickly and and I mean people that I love and like people I normally don't get angry so you know it's it's kind of bothersome
2609,high_059,counsellor,so quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting Eretz of all we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities or some work opportunities
2610,high_059,client,well yeah yeah because I've been kind of partying hard and well I mean my wife gets upset about that and dicky so
2611,high_059,counsellor,could you tell me more is you've been partying your wife's been getting upset with you
2612,high_059,client,well the thing is okay so I'm I don't have a job I'm unemployed and you know I've got some free time on my hands and I'll be honest with you I've been kind of little bit down because of that and I thought you know my friend's been trying to get my spirits up and so you know we've been out partying and drinking and stuff like that but that's not been the only problem that's the thing well I mean you know drinking's been a problem I've been drinking too much
2613,high_059,counsellor,so you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much
2614,high_059,client,yeah but but that's not the only thing I mean I'll be honest with you I've been I've been doing cocaine as well and and then you know of course that leads to more drinking and and you know more cocaine so I'm I'm just trying to think of you know maybe I should cut back on the coke and
2615,high_059,counsellor,time back on the cold
2616,high_059,client,well
2617,high_059,counsellor,you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not have been missing job opportunities you've talked about getting irritable and Anastas and um it being different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more partying a bit more and also using some cocaine I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today if and what would be good for you to talk about now
2618,high_059,client,well I mean well yeah that's that's about it but I guess it'd be kind of like trying to get the the the coke situation a bit under control and because it's getting out of control
2619,high_059,counsellor,out of control
2620,high_059,client,yeah I know some people that are are worse than me
2621,high_059,counsellor,but thinking a bit worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold five things
2622,high_059,client,I guess the worst thing is that you know I've been doing the coke and and well okay I'll tell you about this one situation that it's kind of scared me a little bit is that you know I've done some coke and some booze and like lots of it and I remember this one time I was in the car in the backseat and and the driver had done kind of the same thing you know he'd done some coke and some booze and and it was is it was pretty scary and you know and I was really really high and he was really high and we were driving and it kind of just hit me and it was scary so
2623,high_059,counsellor,so the sliding it's very scary
2624,high_059,client,yeah well I mean I'll be honest with you there's there's been other times that you know I've kind of woken up the next day I mean and I don't even remember
2625,high_059,counsellor,so it's not remembering and that I must be scary too it's a to not remember things
2626,high_059,client,yeah I guess not remembering this has been that's definitely scary and then you know being in situations where it's been really dangerous sometimes it gets foggy and and and you know this is gonna sound kind of silly but you know sometimes the only way I can find out what I've actually done is by going to my Facebook and then finding out because other people have been talking about it or I've seen pictures and stuff like that and that kind of jogs my memory and then when I start to see those things I kind of wish I hadn't done them so
2627,high_059,counsellor,so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested that it's from Europe for you copious that you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you
2628,high_059,client,yeah yeah and you know I guess because I've been putting other people at risk too and I you know I love I love my wife and and and I love my family and I and my friends and I want to do something that's it's right you know that I'm really gonna regret
2629,high_059,counsellor,your family your wife your friends are all really important to you
2630,high_059,client,very very important
2631,high_059,counsellor,thinking about importance Nathan how important would it be for you to to make changes to your copious
2632,high_059,client,well I mean eight I don't know a you know eight out of ten if that's you know
2633,high_059,counsellor,that makes a lot sense
2634,high_059,client,yeah
2635,high_059,counsellor,it's good to use imaginary skills absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and do you know
2636,high_059,client,yeah
2637,high_059,counsellor,okay now so you're roughly eight
2638,high_059,client,yeah
2639,high_059,counsellor,I mean so it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let's see a four
2640,high_059,client,well I guess because it's been been causing me problems and you know I've missed some job interviews and and I don't even know you know kind of what I've done you know until the next day or you know You Know Who I am I you know I've kind of been been hurt you know by my friends and stuff like that and and you know in influence I guess in a bad way from from them and you know and then of course then you know I've been having problems you know sleeping and stuff like that and you know not getting sleep and sleeping properly and you know and then all of that kind of falls back and it's upsetting my family and
2641,high_059,counsellor,it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you two to think about changing
2642,high_059,client,yeah yeah I mean one of the reasons why I come here is I'm thinking because the cocaine in my mind the cocaine is the issue
2643,high_059,counsellor,mm-hmm
2644,high_059,client,and I'm because it's it's a vicious cycle with the cocaine and and drinking and I'm hoping that maybe if I can somehow resolve that then maybe maybe like I won't be drinking as much like I'm okay I'm not an alcoholic I mean and you know just it's it's a problem with the cocaine
2645,high_059,counsellor,so and certainly labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what do what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work
2646,high_059,client,I be honest with you I don't know much I mean I've read a few minor things on the internet but I mean I get confused about that and
2647,high_059,counsellor,I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects. It can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do. Sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it.
2648,high_059,client,Wow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that
2649,high_059,counsellor,it's it's surprising
2650,high_059,client,well you know see the thing is is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and
2651,high_059,counsellor,what else do you make of it
2652,high_059,client,well I guess it means that I really need to stop one of them and he ain't gonna be the beer I guess
2653,high_059,counsellor,so for you if you were to stop one it would be the cocaine
2654,high_059,client,it's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine mix like you say they do it and all that
2655,high_059,counsellor,so thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you but I want to know how confident you are and maybe again in an imaginary scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the most confident one is the least confident
2656,high_059,client,well I mean I'm be honest is yeah I'm not that confident about it I'm I don't know on a scale of one to ten maybe four
2657,high_059,counsellor,four
2658,high_059,client,maybe maybe five four I don't know like yeah
2659,high_059,counsellor,four so there's somewhat competent then I wonder why it's four unless you know a one
2660,high_059,client,I sure I could stop I mean it's just that you know there'd be a lot of temptations you know when I go with my friends I mean a lot of my friends use but I guess
2661,high_059,counsellor,so a lot of you your friends use and it could be quite tempt and and you're sure you could stop
2662,high_059,client,well yeah I think so I mean I mean I could tell them I suppose
2663,high_059,counsellor,so there are some things you could do to help yourself stop them
2664,high_059,client,yeah I guess so I mean I can avoid certain bars where I know it's easily available
2665,high_059,counsellor,and these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I honestly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to start I'm I did mention earlier that I had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us to maybe if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions but how would that feel for you that work
2666,high_059,client,okay yeah that's okay
2667,high_059,counsellor,yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly you become concerned about your recent use you've noticed that your mood's been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some pictures off at risks and and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which I guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you
2668,high_060,counsellor,hi Hannah nice to meet you hi so I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties
2669,high_060,client,hmm yeah um yeah I guess it kind of started like five six years ago
2670,high_060,counsellor,okay
2671,high_060,client,um it kind of escalated a bit and I've just recently moved out um from living with my parents so it made it a bit worse I think
2672,high_060,counsellor,okay is this the first time that you've left home
2673,high_060,client,yeah I am yes first time much the yeah um I was going to a few years ago just thought it would be easier to stay home
2674,high_060,counsellor,okay so it's been quite a big step in a big change and and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP
2675,high_060,client,yeah
2676,high_060,counsellor,so how has that change things for you
2677,high_060,client,um Gennaro its kind of I haven't really told anyone so I mean it's made up like better and since I feel hopefully this is this is it like oh cool it'll help but I don't know I don't like thinking that I've like had to do this I never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help that makes sense
2678,high_060,counsellor,okay so how do you feel about being here today
2679,high_060,client,fits like scared I don't know hopefully it will help
2680,high_060,counsellor,okay so we'd be a little bit anxious about today
2681,high_060,client,yeah
2682,high_060,counsellor,okay so I guess just going back to and why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today so it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years but just recently moved out of home for the first time
2683,high_060,client,annum
2684,high_060,counsellor,and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP so how did that change things how were things after you moved out and
2685,high_060,client,I thought that they'd be better but because I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and space actually a lot were so I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don't really have any friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit but it's not I don't know it's kind of scary because I've just been kind of let you just in the flat by myself which I always thought I'd like but I don't actually like it.
2686,high_060,counsellor,okay so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing
2687,high_060,client,I mean I'm I'm a photographer and so I kind of it's been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and because every time you know there's an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it on so I was kind of making things hard in that respect and just kind of friends wise and everything I'd feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone so it's kind of stopping me from making friends and you know like relationships and stuff
2688,high_060,counsellor,O'Casey said that your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things so they're they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they're also stopping you or you feel like it is stunting you socially you're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people
2689,high_060,client,yeah yeah and it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents as have lost fine but you know they would I'd go to places with them or I'd kind of have people there but more and more I'm just finding myself just staying again a lot I mean I went like two weeks give coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again so I don't I just don't want to I don't want that to happen I don't want to lose everyone so huh
2690,high_060,counsellor,see kind of worried about how where this is going to lead to
2691,high_060,client,yeah um yeah
2692,high_060,counsellor,so you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago so you would have been about 19 yeah and what was happening around that time
2693,high_060,client,I guess I'd finished school about a year before that and I mean I've always been a bit shy at school but it was never ever like it didn't really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years. I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don't know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there. I just stopped going to parties all right say no to invitations or and I thought my job would help because I mean I love it I really like doing photography but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on so which is my fire keep saying no but
2694,high_060,counsellor,what kind of work is the most difficult for you am your job
2695,high_060,client,I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to kind of would do an event or something where there's a lot of people. They're not just photographers but actual you know. If I like taking phrases of people that I don't know I just kind of find myself saying now. I mean I want to do them but just scary so I just don't do it.
2696,high_060,counsellor,so I has tell me a bit more about what happens then so let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with you know it's going to involve photography with with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction what kind of thoughts go through your head
2697,high_060,client,just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don't I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid and feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking I just can't do my job and I'm just an idiot and I mean they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else so that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera because then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to you know be with other people
2698,high_060,counsellor,okay so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at another point where you get that invitation you think people look people stare people will think I'm a weirdo there's quite a lot about what what you think other people will think
2699,high_060,client,yeah
2700,high_060,counsellor,and how does that make you feel and
2701,high_060,client,just makes me feel like an idiot makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anyway I should just go home and I just I think I just don't want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak you can't like do normal things
2702,high_060,counsellor,okay can you give me an example of a recent situation maybe we can focus on that
2703,high_060,client,like a work situation
2704,high_060,counsellor,yeah time when you may be doing a job with some people and you've got the social anxiety you know that you're describing about that kick in
2705,high_060,client,yeah and I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoe and I was having to work with a lot of different people and and and when they told me about the job I thought it would be fine I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers but there are actually people and you know I've taken photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that and I get they asked me to him
2706,high_060,counsellor,that sounds quite interesting was that a fashion shoot
2707,high_060,client,yeah yeah it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something but yeah it was really cool both find it found it really hard to try and focus on max I was so I was kind of feeling really anxious and
2708,high_060,counsellor,so it wasn't what you expected
2709,high_060,client,no no
2710,high_060,counsellor,so how long ago was that that was two weeks ago
2711,high_060,client,okay so it's quite recent yeah so on that particular day what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation
2712,high_060,counsellor,just felt really just really kind of heart I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just focus and just you know like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they'd say action and they'd try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there
2713,high_060,client,I can tell you getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day
2714,high_060,counsellor,yeah
2715,high_060,client,okay so you describe him quite a lot there to me so you're saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty he said that you held the camera yeah what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it or I was just like I focused on it I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly it would just I don't know I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just further
2716,high_060,counsellor,you're holding the camera very tight
2717,high_060,client,yeah
2718,high_060,counsellor,and why was that why was that helpful because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought at least if I can just I don't know it sounds weird but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands are kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads like and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it it wouldn't be as noticeable but
2719,high_060,client,okay so okay so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head and he said that you worried that everyone's looking at you what other thoughts were there that were in your mind
2720,high_060,counsellor,just I was just just stupid and was just really just felt really like a kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just they could tell and just thinking or what what's she doing and
2721,high_060,client,they could tell what
2722,high_060,counsellor,that I was just really like sweaty and just so fat
2723,high_060,client,so oh like that they could see that
2724,high_060,counsellor,yeah yeah and I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers so they can't tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just was just wishing that I just wasn't there
2725,high_060,client,so I mean you've already described it to me a little bit but if you think about how you look that day how do you say how do you think he looked
2726,high_060,counsellor,I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew vow'd was probably sweating and shaking. Like my hands were definitely really really shaking and and ever it was like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely stay.
2727,high_060,client,ok and what did you do about how did you try and conceal that or hide that and
2728,high_060,counsellor,well again I was trying to grip the camera just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean that they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and look down not try it like not look at anyone else and just yeah just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but
2729,high_060,client,so you avoid looking at people and sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway
2730,high_060,counsellor,yeah
2731,high_060,client,no I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because was I'll just be really sweaty and like people would definitely be able to see so
2732,high_060,counsellor,okay and how did it end
2733,high_060,client,well it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it I just I went home straight away just got in my car and went home I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to go get home straight away
2734,high_060,counsellor,okay
2735,high_061,counsellor,good morning Tony
2736,high_061,client,hey
2737,high_061,counsellor,my name is Alex and I'm going to be the nurse taking care of you today so could you please tell me a little bit of about why you're here
2738,high_061,client,I don't even know why I'm here I don't know my mom says I'm obese
2739,high_061,counsellor,so you were your mom suggested to come here because you were obese
2740,high_061,client,yeah I mean I guess so that's why she sent me here yeah honestly she's so mad how they're gonna why everything I don't think I am
2741,high_061,counsellor,okay can I ask you do you see yourself as overweight
2742,high_061,client,No I don't I don't I don't think I'm overweight or obese or whatever she thinks so so that's why I figure
2743,high_061,counsellor,okay well can I tell you a little bit about what being overweight means
2744,high_061,client,yes sure
2745,high_061,counsellor,okay so what it is is basically how we determine that is we're using the BMI so body mass index scale and at the end of it it gives us a number and a number of 25 and higher is associated with being overweight so based on your physical exam results earlier on you're at the 95th percentile
2746,high_061,client,95th
2747,high_061,counsellor,very top of the scale which for lack of a better word but she was overweight
2748,high_061,client,okay well you sure you're right I mean I thought maybe like 27 or something else but
2749,high_061,counsellor,No thats what I have here
2750,high_061,client,95th wow geez I didn't even know what I like okay like what's gonna happen to me now like should I be concern is something gonna happen
2751,high_061,counsellor,there are health risks associated with it but I don't want to scare you I'm going to inform you but before we get there do you mind if I get to know you in your situation a little bit better
2752,high_061,client,yeah sure what do you want to know
2753,high_061,counsellor,so what I like to do is get a little bit of history so throughout this do you mind if I ask you a questions regarding your diet and exercise habits
2754,high_061,client,Yeah sure
2755,high_061,counsellor,okay so so to start us off could you tell me a little bit about what you eat throughout the day so how's your habit like
2756,high_061,client,well I guess like in the morning I'd never eat breakfast it's just like I'm always late you're in a rush and my mom doesn't make breakfast so I don't so when I get to school I tend to be hungry so I go for like the first a large cookie usually and make a large chocolate milk and that usually lasts until lunchtime
2757,high_061,counsellor,okay
2758,high_061,client,and then I have lunch with my buddies we go to the CAF and the regional get french fries and pizza and then after I eat my lunch I usually have like a bag of chips and like two or three pops with my lunch
2759,high_061,counsellor,okay all right so can you tell me a little bit more about what you like about that kind of food
2760,high_061,client,it's comforting okay it's fast it's easy to grab easy to get it tends to be cheap and I get it's like surrounded her it's always it's all around me all the time you know my friends do it like my friends did I eat it with them and I guess it's kind of like a social thing for me my mom isn't cooked so I used to eat it when I get home
2761,high_061,counsellor,oh ok
2762,high_061,client,so it's it's literally everywhere
2763,high_061,counsellor,so let me try to understand so you enjoy it because it's convenient it's on the go and it's always readily available when you need it your friends engage in it and your mom doesn't think it's not exactly of a cookers as much as I understand
2764,high_061,client,yeah
2765,high_061,counsellor,okay so could you tell me a little bit about what are some things that you don't really like about it
2766,high_061,client,well I mean sometimes they make it and there's just so much grease on it that I have the dab it with a napkin to get rid of the grease
2767,high_061,counsellor,yeah
2768,high_061,client,sometimes the line of the calf like it's so long and like my knees were at my back hurts just stand there waiting for it
2769,high_061,counsellor,okay
2770,high_061,client,and to think about it like it's just I guess something to do with my body like that's why I'm yeah right I don't have a I don't have a girlfriend so maybe it's to do something the way I look I'm sure
2771,high_061,counsellor,so let me try to further understand so given the positives you just told me but you also feel like you're in pain for what I'm understanding your back on your knees and it's greasy and maybe you think that it's contributing to your body image and potentially affecting your relationships
2772,high_061,client,that about the summarizes it yeah okay
2773,high_061,counsellor,so given that what you just told me do you think that the food is contributing to your weight gain
2774,high_061,client,yeah like if you put it that way I do think it does contribute when we gain plus like I hate to say it but like mom I think my mom is right like she her nagging is annoying but I think she just means well and once you know for my health it's just for my health
2775,high_061,counsellor,ok so not that I think we covered food and I understand a little bit better can I ask you about your exercise habits some things like any physical activity you engage in or anything like that
2776,high_061,client,I mean exercises mean exercise don't cold water they're like that's just not my thing okay like I don't plan on going to a gym I don't plan on getting into membership like just I mean exercise don't work
2777,high_061,counsellor,okay so if I understand you correctly it is about your priority right now
2778,high_061,client,definitely not my bird oh I think that's like maybe I can focus on something more like eating habits maybe but definitely not exercise
2779,high_061,counsellor,okay so I'm glad to hear that so can I ask you are you considering about making any changes to what you died at this point
2780,high_061,client,yeah like I mean like when I think about it now I don't want to develop some sort of illness in the future and like I definitely don't want to hear from my mom like a colony over way of nagging I mean like so this is definitely something that I'm considered
2781,high_061,counsellor,ok
2782,high_061,client,yeah
2783,high_061,counsellor,so I five believes so if I understand it correctly you're considering to make that change because you don't want to develop a chronic illness later on the life in essentially avoiding conflict with your mother is that correct
2784,high_061,client,yes that's correct
2785,high_061,counsellor,okay so can I ask you on a scale of zero to ten now that you're considering about making a change zero being not important whatsoever and ten being super uber important how important is it for you to make this change
2786,high_061,client,what's it's about like a six well
2787,high_061,counsellor,okay all right and let me ask you another question using a scale again so from scale of zero to ten zero being I'm not confident whatsoever and 10 being I'm super confident how confident are you that you will be able to make this change
2788,high_061,client,let's be honest I would say about like a 4 okay yeah I'm not really that confident
2789,high_061,counsellor,okay so you are on the higher end of the scale in terms of how important it is to you to make that change however you are in the lower end of the scale in terms of your confidence what choose 4
2790,high_061,client,well like I said earlier like fast food is comforting to me and it's all around me and when I like my friends you did
2791,high_061,counsellor,okay
2792,high_061,client,my mom doesn't know the cooks like you don't I get home alright so I just feel that like it's a big part of my life and if I just take it away it's gonna be hard I personally don't feel like I have the will to just like control myself
2793,high_061,counsellor,okay
2794,high_061,client,because like I just feel like I'm just gonna break and like maybe grab a few fries and my friends or something and I'm like I just feel like I mean oh I don't have the will to do thing but at the same time there's you've made me like realize the good of the bad
2795,high_061,counsellor,okay yeah
2796,high_061,client,and I see that like I really do need to be this because it's gonna be the best very
2797,high_061,counsellor,well I'm thank you for telling me that I'm glad to hear that I was able to provide you with some information so that you can take control of your situation so thank you so much but can I ask you something else in order to change or in this case increase that confidence from before to maybe something higher is there anything that can help you with that
2798,high_061,client,well to think about it my my friends were like if they were to eat healthy with me I think that it would help me like increase my confidence and you know accomplish just because like you know they peer pressure and like there would be five days to reach everyday at school right where the see eachother all the time
2799,high_061,counsellor,right okay
2800,high_061,client,another one with us I would say is like maybe my mom like learned to cook something yeah
2801,high_061,counsellor,like cooking class
2802,high_061,client,yeah I'm really good cooking class something cooking book or YouTube or something
2803,high_061,counsellor,okay okay
2804,high_061,client,Cook something so I want to take a seconds or a few minutes.
2805,high_061,counsellor,I want to say congratulations first of all for coming to see me. I know with your mom nagging and that must it must be frustrating for you. But it is you took that initiative. You no matter through your mom's nagging you still came to see me. So congratulations on that.
2806,high_061,client,Thank you
2807,high_061,counsellor,and I really want to say also congratulations to taking this first step and seeing that this is something that could benefit you so that you don't want because from what I understand you don't want to develop any chronic illness or any sort of health risk
2808,high_061,client,oh no no
2809,high_061,counsellor,so thank you so thank you for being here and congratulations again for taking that first step so right now would you like to discuss the potential health risks associated with weight gain and overeating junk food
2810,high_061,client,to be honest like I mean we learn about it's in health class and like my mom has to given me these brochures so many times I've read them I kind of get the gist of it
2811,high_061,counsellor,oh I understand
2812,high_061,client,yeah no health teaching today yeah
2813,high_061,counsellor,I'm tired of the nagging I got I know the time to be
2814,high_061,client,got it all right so where would you like to go from here is there any idea that you have that we can start with and you think that you can do during the week
2815,high_061,counsellor,we can do to help you with this change well like was thinking about it maybe like I don't want nothing to do with exercise
2816,high_061,client,got it
2817,high_061,counsellor,but maybe you we can do some sort of like I don't know meal planner I don't know like something to do with like my diet maybe reduce what I'm eating
2818,high_061,client,okay
2819,high_061,counsellor,you know modify some of the things I'm eating I guess like I know pop is bad for me and that those chips so maybe I couldn't like reduce some of that maybe and change it from three to three to one pop a day
2820,high_061,client,got it
2821,high_061,counsellor,there's no more chips okay
2822,high_061,client,so it looks like you have an idea that could potentially do contribute to you to your decreasing what you eat or in this case substituting what you eat in my correct yes make suggestion
2823,high_061,counsellor,yes
2824,high_061,client,may I make a suggestion
2825,high_061,counsellor,yeah sure
2826,high_061,client,sometimes what happens is in order for people to fully realize the behavior that they're engaging in sometimes what ends up in the notices with other clients writing down seems to help so I know what this might sound lame but are you open to the idea of keeping some kind of a log list journal or anything like that that indicates on it somewhere what you're eating and we're and also what you're substituting are you open to that idea
2827,high_061,counsellor,I mean I guess it's like I can see where you're coming like where it could benefit
2828,high_061,client,okay
2829,high_061,counsellor,um so yeah I mean it's worth a shot I mean how how bad can it be right I mean I have nothing to lose so
2830,high_061,client,okay
2831,high_061,counsellor,yeah why not I'll try it so over the next couple of weeks so if we were to set up a follow-up appointment would you be comfortable of keeping that journal and then coming to me after so we can review it together
2832,high_061,client,yeah of course okay you're really good at this thing
2833,high_061,counsellor,thank you so can we let's recap what we talked about today so you came here to see me despite your mom nagging and making you feel like you have to be here because she said so but you were able to see that you were able to identify that this is something this is your decision this is something that would benefit you instead of your mom so you given me the goods and the bads of your junk food and you were able to essentially come up with some kind of an action plan so where its building that awareness of junk food and by being open to the idea of keeping a log is there anything I missed
2834,high_061,client,no I think you got it you got most of it are all of it
2835,high_061,counsellor,yeah so can we make a follow up appointment where we can review that journal after to see what's working for you what's not working for you yeah sure
2836,high_061,client,if something isn't working for you we can always go back to the drawing board
2837,high_061,counsellor,okay

2893,high_062,counsellor,well my sister questions about that that period of time in your town
2894,high_062,client,is that significant I mean do you really mean

2898,high_062,client,no that's fine that's fine
2899,high_062,counsellor,I know these things can be hard to talk about
2900,high_062,client,it's okay so what was it that you wanted to
2901,high_062,counsellor,well remember we talked before you said it was a time it sounded like a started about a year ago
2902,high_062,client,oh yeah
2903,high_062,counsellor,we were kind of down like now you're you see my good little off
2904,high_062,client,oh oh you mean like my summer yeah right it was less no it wasn't it was last year about this time but then it lasted to the summer it lasted but women you know it was at six months and that was miserable I do not want to feel like that again and I mean I felt like that before I've been a couple times I think but you know like can I just tell you I am so productive right now that right back then I was not I definitely was not I thought it was such a different type of feeling I was like lying around on the sofa all day I was you know oh my god it was sleeping all of it I hate everyone meets right now it's fantastic I mean I categorized all of my photographs from when I was a baby through graduate school and I've got them and all these look good anyway what was I saying - I was talking about
2905,high_062,counsellor,is normal enjoy playing with your kids
2906,high_062,client,oh yeah yeah
2907,high_062,counsellor,you just not through that time
2908,high_062,client,that was horrible no
2909,high_062,counsellor,and you mentioned that you weren't sleeping too well do you have any weight changes during that time
2910,high_062,client,definitely you know closer to 150 back Bettany about right now 15 and that's great but ya know I gained a lot of weight I do not want to go back to that again yeah I'm like 115 right now I went to Bloomingdale's last night do not tell my husband but they were having the most amazing sale I think I spent too much I mean I probably
2911,high_062,counsellor,spent a lot
2912,high_062,client,but it was on sale and the stuff is gorgeous I mean if he saw it he really could not complain because I was meant to have it again seriously these sweaters are beautiful
2913,high_062,counsellor,so this symmetry which how you're feeling now sounds really opposite way you felt six months ago
2914,high_062,client,oh yeah yeah yeah completely but I mean this is good so during that time so I'm going back down back to that time for a second did you have feelings of worthlessness yeah but I mean I could probably guilt ya
2915,high_062,counsellor,can tell me about how the symptoms the presence of the symptoms like the frequency duration for example during that time period was that most of the day nearly every day that you felt this way did you have any trouble concentrating or making decisions
2916,high_062,client,yeah
2917,high_062,counsellor,having a thoughts of suicide this is back this information is very helpful thanks Ian
2918,high_063,counsellor,at least how you doing today
2919,high_063,client,I'm doing well thank you
2920,high_063,counsellor,doing well what's going on
2921,high_063,client,I have family coming into town I have to go to the airport to pick them up
2922,high_063,counsellor,so you have family flying in
2923,high_063,client,yes I get very anxious about having to cross the bridge I have to cross the Ben Franklin Bridge and then get over the bridge that goes to the airport by the stadium I think that's a Gerrard Point Bridge don't wanna yeah that's two levels there I have to do that both ways and then call you in coming
2924,high_063,counsellor,both ways you have to do it across four times
2925,high_063,client,yes
2926,high_063,counsellor,so what kind of feeling is just bringing up for you
2927,high_063,client,I get very anxious even thinking about it right now.
2928,high_063,counsellor,so you're anxious right here with me
2929,high_063,client,yes yeah
2930,high_063,counsellor,so I want to try to scale this we talked about this before with cognitive therapy so let's say that 10 is really the most anxious you're felt about crossing bridges right and one is no anxiety where would you be right now right now
2931,high_063,client,probably an 8 it's worse when I'm at that point of that day but right now I think just knowing that I have to do that yes
2932,high_063,counsellor,and what's it on that day
2933,high_063,client,yes
2934,high_063,counsellor,all right so but even now how far away is the until they
2935,high_063,client,oh it's a week there's we coming yet
2936,high_063,counsellor,so even now a week out loses it's Nate this is really hurt
2937,high_063,client,No
2938,high_063,counsellor,so for your job and local travel you don't really have to cross any
2939,high_063,client,ten minutes to work everyday and bang so 20 minutes I went shopping centers and everything that's just within the vicinity I don't have to cross any bridges
2940,high_063,counsellor,right so no snow bridges yeah thanks probably planned it that way it's good I don't know
2941,high_063,client,it worked out well okay all right coming up pick up the family you will be crossing so let's look at this in each stage okay so I mean you're clearly anxious now as you mentioned let's go to trying to move forward a week to the day that they'll be fine at what time they find it
2942,high_063,counsellor,it's gonna be a four o'clock flight
2943,high_063,client,so about what time would you have to leave -
2944,high_063,counsellor,I would have to leave probably at 3 o'clock because it's only about 20 minutes to the airport really
2945,high_063,client,really
2946,high_063,counsellor,but I would like to leave earlier they're probably taking up time by the time they land and to go through you know they're getting their luggages they probably won't even come out till maybe 4:30 but I'd like to make sure I'm there at around 3:30 4 o'clock
2947,high_063,client,all right so let's go to the best day it's good that day and said that afternoon
2948,high_063,counsellor,okay
2949,high_063,client,so you're still at home and let's say we're about 15 minutes before you have to get in the car what are you thinking then
2950,high_063,counsellor,I have to do this to to get up and go they need me to be there this this week it's my parents coming in and they're elderly so I don't want them to be stuck at the airport there's no one else that actually can go pick them up so I have to get up and go and pick them up so
2951,high_063,client,that's going here
2952,high_063,counsellor,that is what's going through my mind that you know there's nobody else that can do this I mean it's cheaper than there's nothing I can't probably can't even afford to get a taxi for them because you'd have to cross that's from Philly to into New Jersey so that's gonna be very expensive I can't afford that when all I'd have to do is pay $5.00 for the tow and maybe gas up my car for $10 or something but hey I'll be thinking about it I have to do this and I'm not really doing it you know it's something that I can save money that way and I don't want to leave them stranded definitely someone else can I mean baby lost they're not familiar with there but in Philly the airport is crazy to me
2953,high_063,client,it's a big place a lot going on so so you're sitting at home in 15 minutes before you eat in the car and you're thinking I have to do this but your reasons are positive like you to save money and protect your parents from having to be there alone so ones things I do come in
2954,high_063,counsellor,um just the thought of the bridge there it's just I could drive off the bridge you know they can fall off usually what I do is try to stay in the middle lane I can't do more miles an hour and I just I'm shaking I have the radio on and windows down because I can't swim so for any reason I'm to fall off I mean that's it for me I even have a little metal one of those so I think it's an instrument that you used in the house for I don't know pliers or something is something real hard that I can hit the glass with it sits right there on my door so I'm all ready I planned and I have that I planned ahead of time I know what I'm gonna do as soon as I approach the patient but I still feel anxious
2955,high_063,client,you're anxious before you leave and you're and you're starting to think about the bridge at that point we already think about it
2956,high_063,counsellor,yes
2957,high_063,client,how about when you get your car you start driving toward the bridge say a prayer I'm still anxious I turn on the radio the closer I get to especially the toll points and I know it's at me and you see those lights flashing last exit before you know
2958,high_063,counsellor,you know you're going over one
2959,high_063,client,yeah I have no there's no turning back there's no turning back
2960,high_063,counsellor,so before that when you can still exit what's your anxiety level
2961,high_063,client,before when I can still Excel yeah it's probably still high it's about the other than the high nor so it's still high but
2962,high_063,counsellor,it's not maxed out yet but every lap
2963,high_063,client,it's gonna be
2964,high_063,counsellor,yeah I think it's pretty bad at that point
2965,high_063,client,and how about when you cross through the that's an inside the tendon okay
2966,high_063,counsellor,yes yes
2967,high_063,client,so your specific fear as you start to cross this is the bed Frank want to be the first bridge right you can do across is that your car will go off the bridge
2968,high_063,counsellor,yes
2969,high_063,client,and when does that so that's a 10th anxiety when does that anxiety start to go away
2970,high_063,counsellor,as soon as that getting close to getting off the bridge and now leaving that little sigh of relief there's a little release there and I know that I've been able to manage those two three minutes of cross that into how many minutes it takes actually of crossing crossing the bridge and I start feeling a little bit of relief but then again I know I have to do my back exit and there's another one coming by that so starts all over again all
2971,high_063,client,right Sonia crossed the second bridge the drug point fridge you go to the airport as your anxiety dropping those points
2972,high_063,counsellor,Oh as soon as this I'm descending from the Gerrard Point Bridge there's less you know it's almost reduced. I'm not coming you know really low it's almost going. Yes it's not Muskaan.
2973,high_063,client,yes
2974,high_063,counsellor,and when you start thinking about that you're gonna have to cross them again
2975,high_063,client,as soon as I'm exit I'm getting back on 95 going north and I know here we go again and cars that zooming by and you know
2976,high_063,counsellor,as you're not going to really
2977,high_063,client,know I'm that person into the middle lane doing 40 miles an hour yes
2978,high_063,counsellor,all right so you're you're doing everything you can to keep your car on the bridge but you're still feeling anxiety like you're gonna go off the bridge
2979,high_063,client,yes the whole the whole time until you start really descending
2980,high_063,counsellor,exactly
2981,high_063,client,and then you feel like you've made it
2982,high_063,counsellor,yes especially when there are those big trucks tractor trailers coming
2983,high_063,client,does the air
2984,high_063,counsellor,yes yes if it's also in bad weather or at night it's worse because on the bridge especially the top one you kind of see the sky and there's nothing else you see so it's like you're gonna fall off yes
2985,high_063,client,so in the lower level it's not as bad
2986,high_063,counsellor,all the lower level coming back it's not as bad because you're kind of like protected here and there so it's not as bad but going is definitely worse yes
2987,high_063,client,are you aware of any time a car will gone off the bridge
2988,high_063,counsellor,I hear all the news once in a while you'll hear something happen or sometimes in movies you see things happen I think it's possible
2989,high_063,client,it's possible do you think it's a high risk
2990,high_063,counsellor,no maybe none of that um Girard bridge because I I noticed I was checking it the other day I had to go to the airport and I was trying to measure the distance between the metal poles just to see if a car could fit there really and I think a car could fit there but you know it just depends on the angle you were hit or something or if you flipped so yeah done some thinking she's
2991,high_063,client,done some calculations geometry right and you've concluded that it's not really likely but it could all right so but either way your anxiety is maxed out on each bridge now when you get home I mean get your parents back to you take them back to your house
2992,high_063,counsellor,yes
2993,high_063,client,and you feel them
2994,high_063,counsellor,I don't even recall all the anxiety know why it was such a big deal anyway I don't think about it at all
2995,high_063,client,all right so you when you arrived home you're down to one
2996,high_063,counsellor,yes yes
2997,high_063,client,all right so going back to the the first stage like when you're getting ready you're thinking that you have to go
2998,high_063,counsellor,yes
2999,high_063,client,and it would save your parents money
3000,high_063,counsellor,it would save me money how it can be the one calling the can but if people want to pick them up and save them from being stranded at the airport than being in a land that they they're not familiar with an area they're not familiar with so make sure that they're safe
3001,high_063,client,how important is their safety to you know very important yes
3002,high_063,counsellor,so it clearly it sounds like you picked them up before
3003,high_063,client,yes
3004,high_063,counsellor,so picking them up is it's worth all the anxiety
3005,high_063,client,it's worth but yes it's
3006,high_063,counsellor,tough
3007,high_063,client,it's still something that bothers me that I have to do yeah it's worth the inside
3008,high_063,counsellor,that's worth it but you wish that you could do it without anxiety
3009,high_063,client,yes I wish there was another route that I could take any bridges at all that's not known yet defined yeah
3010,high_063,counsellor,and how long have you had that anxiety we try to approach it
3011,high_063,client,as long as I can remember that I know maybe even that when I was younger but perhaps as a mother and you know someone as I got that life was important I mean prior to maybe marriage and kids
3012,high_063,counsellor,all right developed along the way somewhere it's been with you ever since
3013,high_063,client,yes
3014,high_063,counsellor,so I'd like to do what kind of therapy we call a refrain and actually you've kind of already done it but I want to make it a little clearer so you suffer things I D and you suffer it to protect mostly protector your parents
3015,high_063,client,yes
3016,high_063,counsellor,so as you're going over the bridge you're thinking about the automatic thought we talked about these before right the thought that kind of pops in your mind is I'm gonna fly off the bridge
3017,high_063,client,yes
3018,high_063,counsellor,so that seems pretty unlikely all right that's not something that maybe as you talk about geometrically maybe there's some way your car could find the bridge with physics now maybe could happen but it seems like it would be do you fairly like
3019,high_063,client,yeah
3020,high_063,counsellor,so you could challenge that and this isn't the refrain part but you could challenge that on that thought which with a statement and adapt a response like it's pretty unlikely I think it's going to happen alright that might help a bit to keep applying then the chances are vastly in your favor I could sing how many cars you cross that bridge I'm a fly off the bridge alright heard of plan out for those bridges but the other you know the refrain part is that you're you're doing this you're willing to take on the bridges and have this anxiety for the betterment of your parents for their safety
3021,high_063,client,yes
3022,high_063,counsellor,so in this whole equation of crossing bridges and anxiety and you're really really the good guy in this you're you're willing to you're willing to suffer and overcome a fear to make sure your parents are saying yeah I mean and you've thought about before like before you leave you think I only have to pick a month but you've never really connected it to want to be in the good guy here
3023,high_063,client,well yeah
3024,high_063,counsellor,okay does that make sense
3025,high_063,client,yes it does it does yes like here go my guess my family size my brothers and sisters appreciate that yes
3026,high_063,counsellor,yeah you've overcome it before to pick them up and when you pick up again you'll you'll overcome it again and you'll suffer but I the difference here is that that reframe I want you to apply that reframe when you're feeling that anxiety issue get ready to leave and as you're trapped with the bridge that you're really you know you're doing what you feel is right for the good of your family
3027,high_063,client,yes
3028,high_063,counsellor,all right so the automatic thought that's gonna come in in is you're gonna fly off the bridge okay that's what that's what the exoti is about Miss Spears and the reframe in this case the reframe adapter response is I'm doing I'm doing this for my family and the probabilities preloaded like the bridge that's a separate thing but the reframe is I'm no I'm the hero of this I think that's a great way to look at here to hear of this situation
3029,high_063,client,so think of that terms at the beginning of that day or they went up to hold
3030,high_063,counsellor,the whole day yeah yeah just kind of go over that should rather than like something you must do because really you don't have to do it strictly speaking right I know you feel you have to do it but you're willing to do it you're willing to sacrifice and suffer to do it
3031,high_063,client,okay
3032,high_063,counsellor,and I'd rather that be the theme that you're getting is a positive thing that you're that you're willing to do it has to be done it's uncomfortable you'll survive it it's uncomfortable I focus on that kind of reframe then focusing on the very low probability that you're the risk that you're going to fly off the bridge so it's very low low risk
3033,high_063,client,okay look uh make
3034,high_063,counsellor,sense and
3035,high_063,client,make sense and make sense
3036,high_063,counsellor,so it's not so much being forced to do it me forced into an extra situation you're voluntarily in brave and I know it's hard it's hard for you didn't use your say it's a 10 on the anxiety to get that's that's the highest score right so it's hard for you but the way to look at it maybe would be you're doing has to be done you to flee go your family they need you have you ever had any close calls on a bridge or anything
3037,high_063,client,um when it there was that day when there was a lot of thunderstorm and there was wind so I could literally feel the car shaking on the bridge and there was a day I think I was coming into Delaware I had to stop and call those they say if you need help crossing the bridge and I stopped and call them but they talked me before they talk to me for about half an hour or so and then they told me that it would take another hour for someone to literally be able to come and get me and this was like that I was leaving here it was self probably around 10:00 10:30 class was over I was on the bridge and it was late at night raining and I just I couldn't do it but after a while I think I calmed down with their conversation and I was able to just take it easy in that middle lane she always managed to overcome
3038,high_063,counsellor,yeah and that might be another a good automatic thought or adaptive response to that on that thought is that I've always managed overcome this and it hurts but managed overcome it
3039,high_063,client,yes
3040,high_063,counsellor,I kind of taken charge like that and being assertive that might help reduce that automatically
3041,high_063,client,ok
3042,high_063,counsellor,you think if you try that this time is you
3043,high_063,client,that's thinking in that positive way I've done this before and then that can do it again
3044,high_063,counsellor,yeah
3045,high_063,client,all right all right
3046,high_063,counsellor,so I'll see you again in two weeks which will give an opportunity
3047,high_063,client,to pick them up from me you're quite a bit
3048,high_063,counsellor,and then we'll see how things start with that and we'll move from there
3049,high_063,client,okay
3050,high_063,counsellor,all right thanks sweetie
3051,high_063,client,thank you very much
3052,high_064,counsellor,so I'm hearing the good part about drinking is that it keeps you calm and I'm also hearing the downside about it is that you started wanting spenders and your family get a bit concerned it must be tough so what is that like for you
3053,high_064,client,a little bit down and or Danika really pick-me-up is a good drink
3054,high_064,counsellor,yeah so you kind of use it as a way to shift your mood a little bit yeah okay and so what what do you what would you like to do what would you like to change
3055,high_064,client,I don't like the way that makes everybody feel when I get overly intoxicated. So I feel like I need to just find another way. I need to stop.
3056,high_064,counsellor,okay so you noticing that it's kind of a little too long and so you want to find an alternative means of coping or trying to relax
3057,high_064,client,yes
3058,high_064,counsellor,okay and what are some alternatives
3059,high_064,client,well my buddy from work told me about some places that might be able to help me with some some strategies around giving up drinking
3060,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3061,high_064,client,thought about going back to church
3062,high_064,counsellor,so on a scale of zero to 100 how important do you think it is for you to make this change
3063,high_064,client,I know it's it's it's clearly above 50%. I feel like if I don't stop just now end up in a grave somewhere. So I need to take this.
3064,high_064,counsellor,okay so around 50 and on a scale from zero to 100 100 how confident are you in making this change
3065,high_064,client,I've tried before maybe a day or two and then something really bad happened or things got tough and I just went right back to drinking
3066,high_064,counsellor,the good side of it is that you understand that you need help and I think that's awesome really really good for you to have that insight so I'm hearing that you're not that confident okay so from from 0 to 100 where are you
3067,high_064,client,I'm gonna be in less than 50% because I have been way too long without drinking uh sometimes when I work I think about getting off just to have that one
3068,high_064,counsellor,so in terms of importance you're around 50 in terms of confidence it's less than 50 so I'm hearing that it's important you know that it's important for you to make that change but in terms of confidence you're not that confident okay so what do you think it would take to help build that confidence
3069,high_064,client,well I live alone really have anybody that comes and shakes on me so
3070,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3071,high_064,client,maybe if I had somebody you know take your time to check on me
3072,high_064,counsellor,right right
3073,high_064,client,find out how I'm doing every now and again that might keep me encouraged
3074,high_064,counsellor,so I'm hearing that you you would like someone to help keep you accountable and also to help encourage you and motivate you towards making this change and and this is the reason why you mentioned your belief system before and if I if it's okay if I may ask your permission what the people at your church be some of the people that you can turn to for some of the the accountability and you know help motivate you to change
3075,high_064,client,I guess that's what church is for I've been in church since I was a little boy I don't know that that's where you go to get right so all of you are the right people
3076,high_064,counsellor,right so I hear you say I want to get right and I kind of hear that willingness to want to change can you tell me 103 best reasons for you to make this change
3077,high_064,client,she's always telling me I don't need to drink she doesn't want me to hurt myself I see how makes me feel when I drink I'm usually in the rut I feel good terrible again I just want to do I want to go out and achieve some things in life change this
3078,high_064,counsellor,okay so some of the things I'm hearing is that you might want to do it for your mother and I'm hearing that you would want to achieve this you're maturing on in life and so for you and what's another one
3079,high_064,client,just thinking oh maybe I'll grow healthier tonight some that drink as much quartz I drank it all
3080,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3081,high_064,client,people you know they don't drink and they seem to be really healthy
3082,high_064,counsellor,uh-huh
3083,high_064,client,so maybe I maybe I can be that one day
3084,high_064,counsellor,walk me through a day of drinking for you
3085,high_064,client,well not working
3086,high_064,counsellor,okay
3087,high_064,client,I wake up in the morning and I usually try to fix myself some breakfast but I end up drinking a little bit because I keep a little something
3088,high_064,counsellor,okay
3089,high_064,client,but by the middle of the day I find that I'm really loose after having a few drinks and I say a lot of terrible things I don't recall it in in particular but I've been recorded and friends have told me you know things that I've said under the influence and it really rowdy anything I'm taking out nobody when I'm when I'm drinking then I get kicked out of places
3090,high_064,counsellor,yeah yeah
3091,high_064,client,I can drive and
3092,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3093,high_064,client,it's just not it's not the way I want to live it's I feel too dependent upon having the right drink
3094,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3095,high_064,client,it can't be empty and
3096,high_064,counsellor,some hearing when you wake up you've had a drink in the morning right before breakfast
3097,high_064,client,yes
3098,high_064,counsellor,and by that time you're calm and you're loose and anything you just get a little belligerent okay it's causing you to get kicked out a lot of places you know and I'm hearing them you're saying that that's no way to live and so you no longer want that yeah and the good the good thing about what I'm hearing is that you have friends
3099,high_064,client,yes
3100,high_064,counsellor,well care enough to notice what's going on and bring it to your attention by recording you
3101,high_064,client,yes
3102,high_064,counsellor,and so when you see yourself
3103,high_064,client,"I feel I feel bad sometimes. We make fun of me because my buddies drink. They drink, yeah, but not unlike me. I'm the worst one. Everyone else can take it in, to have one beer, be done. And me, I'll just keep going. Everybody goes home and you know it's just me."
3104,high_064,counsellor,and something your buddies have in common right
3105,high_064,client,yeah but they I think they're just seeing me in a different way when it went out I've hurt so many people
3106,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3107,high_064,client,and I just don't want to do it anymore they told me I mean oh and I believe our new home
3108,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3109,high_064,client,everybody's saying that he helps or I must I must in Galax
3110,high_064,counsellor,yeah and so help is available I have a few substance abuse places that I'd like to refer you to and maybe some hey have you heard of alcohol Anonymous meetings as we mentioned before support group and your church as you mentioned so these are the avenues that you said you would like to go into
3111,high_064,client,I mean sounds alright I don't want to feel like I don't have control
3112,high_064,counsellor,right
3113,high_064,client,I don't want to feel I don't want to drink I want help I just don't want to feel like I'm trapped in one particular program I mean they do make community do these guys helped me to find strategies

3115,high_064,client,yes good
3116,high_064,counsellor,okay so we've talked about where you are in terms of wanting change we talked about where you act as far as feeling confident in change we also discussed a little bit about the reasons why you want to change the three reasons you mentioned your mom you mentioned for yourself you mentioned your health in the session we also discussed some avenues that you may take in terms of getting that support that you want we talked about your belief system a little bit we talked about church we talked about referrals in places that you may be interested in so you talked about a lot and I want to hear from you how is this going for you how how was the session been going for you in the past the last session that we had before

3118,high_064,counsellor,yeah
3119,high_064,client,you didn't tell me I was some scumbag whose side of the road you told me I needed a clean up because I'm a junkie so I came back and you've made it very easy for me to speak to you and that's the only reason because everybody else talks to me but they they talk down to me and I don't like that and not feel ashamed of myself but speaking to you telling me I understand I can get man up and I can do something different nothing regain my self-confidence
3120,high_064,counsellor,yeah well thank you I'm glad that you have had a wonderful experience in terms of speaking with me today and I'm glad that you've also decided on what you want to do in terms of making those changes for your life and I'm glad that I can I can be a partner in helping you to achieve those things I really really appreciate it so if there are any goals that you would like to achieve for our next session or in the future

3131,high_065,counsellor,just sounds like you're really busy all the time yeah
3132,high_065,client,yeah you can say that you got home a lot
3133,high_065,counsellor,um actually no not really I only live a couple hours away but my parents come here not frequently but enough that I get to see them so you say they play basketball
3134,high_065,client,yes
3135,high_065,counsellor,yes
3136,high_065,client,yes so walgreens whopping two-year like what you decide
3137,high_065,counsellor,well I've been struggling with some anxiety issues lately and I can't seem to figure out why I just I've been having some like anxiety attacks and panic attacks just wasn't like the last couple months and I thought him just go away on their own and like they think has come on at night sometimes or at first I thought they were centered around like papers and normal collops things but then like I had one were fall break whenever I didn't have anything to do looking to be here
3138,high_065,client,have you so you see that it has nothing to do with schoolwork because you said you have a really cool place and you don't think I hadn't anything to do it back
3139,high_065,counsellor,I don't think into this and I mean it's a big school of constant thing so it's my senior year or two and I had to pop up until now so I I don't know I can't really figure out what could be causing it
3140,high_065,client,how are things at home with your family
3141,high_065,counsellor,I'm dinner going well my little sister actually she's a freshman in college this year so my parents are at home with the emptiness and trying to figure out what i'm going to do with their free time and call me a lot i went off a lot but I mean everything's fine I see my grandparents pretty often my sister is going well
3142,high_065,client,that's good so so you and your family are going well
3143,high_065,counsellor,we're we ever pretty close
3144,high_065,client,how I was like the social life like how are things at school you know with your friends and ball how are things going
3145,high_065,counsellor,socially everything is going well too just trying to keep everything balanced it's a but I mean I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job of it
3146,high_065,client,you get very clean school and stuff
3147,high_065,counsellor,yeah and i will say that senior year brings you know the senioritis around sometime so it's hard to get some motivation in there but um I mean schools would well like I I'm happy with my grades are socially I'd say that I mean my friends are still there like I love my friends I'm i feel like i do the same things that is nothing different going on
3148,high_065,client,okay
3149,high_065,counsellor,socially I
3150,high_065,client,just just get anxiety attacks just randomly
3151,high_065,counsellor,yeah
3152,high_065,client,do you notice any pattern maybe when things id attack occurs

3290,high_066,counsellor,okay
3291,high_066,client,like these items are gonna ask you
3292,high_066,counsellor,okay
3293,high_066,client,have you have you noticed in the sense you had the onset of you know what you're probably panic disorders we talked about so last night one city noticed a fear of using public transportation all did you ever use public transportation we start with
3294,high_066,counsellor,I did to do the bus to work sometimes know if I if I take the bus I mean what if that happens on the bus more am I gonna go
3295,high_066,client,do an escape
3296,high_066,counsellor,yeah I'm scared
3297,high_066,client,okay how about being an open spaces in general when parking lots right
3298,high_066,counsellor,yeah like really freaky
3299,high_066,client,yeah okay that brings up worry and anxiety for you
3300,high_066,counsellor,"I can feel the heartbeat actually. Yeah, I haven't. Yeah, that's become from."
3301,high_066,client,okay how the opposite have a being in enclosed spaces like a crowd of people waiting in line
3302,high_066,counsellor,out but when I was at the mall with my husband and we were in line I could definitely feel it you know actually you know what we put our stuff down and I didn't even buy it we left
3303,high_066,client,similarly standing in line being a crowd
3304,high_066,counsellor,yeah we've been doing a lot of it but yeah hope being outside alone in general that's been taking
3305,high_066,client,I haven't been going a lot you know if my husband goes with me you know maybe if my friend goes but yeah
3306,high_066,counsellor,that sometimes helps if you have something else with you
3307,high_066,client,if I have to do
3308,high_066,counsellor,okay when you find yourself out in crowds and close spaces and open places what response you're having like what's what's happening when you're out there sight let's just use for example a crowd at the mall
3309,high_066,client,okay well at first like I noticed that my heart was pounding you know and then I noticed that it was hard to breathe and then I started thinking about the last time it happened and I was like oh my god it's gonna happen again and then I've got to get out of there if I can get out before oh my god even thinking about it right now like
3310,high_066,counsellor,even seeing it with me it's a scary thing for his fearful
3311,high_066,client,yeah I didn't want to come out you know Joe's in the waiting room you know I can't even come here by myself
3312,high_066,counsellor,it's getting away of your life yeah and you're potentially in treatment I'm glad you did he did come do you think that the response you're having does seem to match a danger level around you like you feel like the most dangerous or the spaces of danger so you think about logically
3313,high_066,client,like if I'm thinking about it right here with you
3314,high_066,counsellor,yeah like it feels it feels that way
3315,high_066,client,yeah I think about logically it isn't no it's not how many years of my life did I go to the mall and I was fine
3316,high_066,counsellor,you mentioned this we call for nine months yeah it does seem like it's getting in the way of your life do you have any severe or moderate medical conditions how are you physically
3317,high_066,client,well I had a cold in September this information has been really helpful in my creation
3318,high_067,counsellor,hi Dina
3319,high_067,client,hi
3320,high_067,counsellor,I'm hailing the dietitian how are you
3321,high_067,client,here real
3322,high_067,counsellor,good how you doing today
3323,high_067,client,how are you
3324,high_067,counsellor,do you want to speak to me?
3325,high_067,client,just not diagnosed with these I'm really confused and concerned so the doctor said that I should come see you some help
3326,high_067,counsellor,yeah absolutely um do you know what type
3327,high_067,client,1 diabetes
3328,high_067,counsellor,so basically what type 1 diabetes is it's a condition where our body stops production on the hormone called insulin and what influences for our body is it helps to convert food which is converted to sugar into energy for ourselves so let me show you an example let's say that this is ourselves and this is glucose so what food breaks down now our cells will need you to glucose as of energy but glucose can't get into it so it's insulin acts as a hormone open up your cells the cause of the glucose and that is how it's used for energy and this energy is what we use in everyday life like thinking talking moving things like that so without insulin your body isn't able to get the glucose into ourselves so this caused us a lot of problems so with that we have conditions like hyper let's eat yet which is what we have too much glucose in the body and that's off hypoglycemia which is what we have not and this is kind of the bounce we could try to face when it comes to type 1 diabetes so it's really important to monitor and make sure that we keep the blood glucose levels or sugar intact so do you have any questions so far?
3329,high_067,client,no no
3330,high_067,counsellor,okay great so did your doctor talk to you anything about insulin or taking insulin
3331,high_067,client,he prescribed me for what he sounds a fast-acting insulin and that I should take it before you
3332,high_067,counsellor,okay so today we're actually going to talk about different ways that you can meet and how we can work with your diet and foods would eat with the insulin you're gonna take it so we're gonna talk about carbohydrate counting which I'll explain in a second we're also gonna talk about portion sizes we're also gonna talk about timing and his estate meals especially when it comes to taking insulin so before we start I asked you did you forget any food items in today
3333,high_067,client,I brought some macaroni cheese delicious
3334,high_067,counsellor,okay awesome so when it comes to carbohydrate crowning we always want to make sure that we're aware of the carpod so if you know what a carbohydrate is
3335,high_067,client,the star chips my prey like bread rice pasta
3336,high_067,counsellor,absolutely so do like
3337,high_067,client,yeah
3338,high_067,counsellor,okay great so when it comes to carbohydrates there's also different types of carbohydrates in foods like ice cream or milk or some of our vegetables actually contain carbohydrates just sometimes not so much but they still contain a little bit some carbohydrates so let's look at this so when it comes to looking at nutrition labels we want to make sure that we're counting the total amount of carbohydrates per serving so when we account for carb exchange we like to think of 15 grams of carbohydrate equals one carb exchange and we want to make sure especially we type 1 diabetes that were laundering that especially with the influent we're taking so when it comes to 15 grams per one exchange how many carbons changes do you think are in one serving of the second cheese
3339,high_067,client,okay serving 47 grams
3340,high_067,counsellor,yeah that's great that's awesome um that's exactly right and it's also good that you've rounded an off so you know kind of exact or estimates of how many cars you do so it's really good to be aware of that now is there any other foods that you brought in today
3341,high_067,client,yeah in my morning cereal
3342,high_067,counsellor,I'm seeing great great so based off the serving size of one cup how many karbix changes do you see
3343,high_067,client,okay so there's 42
3344,high_067,counsellor,yeah absolutely so that's great so making sure that you're aware of that it's awesome and it's really beneficial especially we know where again how many so great I also looked at your 24-hour recall and I wrote down some items that you ate during dinner and this was the nutrition facts for them and one of them is the avocado chicken salad from Panera and the pizza field corazon you had so based on the nutrition label how many total carbs that they have for each one
3345,high_067,client,okay there is 7 grams carbohydrate in avocado chicken salad and 15 grams of carbohydrates in the real one
3346,high_067,counsellor,okay great that's awesome um when it comes to the avocado chicken salad there tends to be a low amount of carbohydrates because of the vegetables but also being aware that chicken and fat don't contain any carbohydrates so it's really important for the constitute exchanges that you're aware of kind of how fat doesn't have any carbs but to gain consideration why do you think the veal parmesan has 15 grams of carbohydrate yeah that's that's awesome you made the distinction so yeah I'm just making sure when you check your salads or you're checking your meat that there's no there is if they're just start to comes out as a card exchange or you kind of do it so that's great do any questions okay great so going forward I wanna ask you a little bit about portion sizes so when it comes to portion sizes this goes hand-in-hand with carbohydrate counting does you want to know how many portion sizes you have to avoid if you're overeating or knowing coming cartilage so going with that we like to do a hand method which is about one fistful is about one cup of vegetables or rice or pasta and this is a good measurement of kind of how many carbs are so for example if you have one cup of pasta that would be three cartridges because 1/3 of a cup of pasta is what carb exchange so just being aware of that same with rice and also with vegetables it's great because 1/2 a cup is only eventual exchange but there's very little carbohydrates so you all have to really worry about how much I'm one cup of script so using the hand method is a really great way of pushing out so I wanted to ask you face off of the cereal how many this amount of cereal
3347,high_067,client,so I'm gonna make my fist looked a little bigger than my fist so I take about a cup and a half so since one cup is three carbs exchanges
3348,high_067,counsellor,yeah
3349,high_067,client,it would probably be a little bit more than three exchanges
3350,high_067,counsellor,great great that's awesome so that's a really good method you can use we also like to use again with the hand method something that you can look at is three ounces of a meat or chicken is about the size of your palm and for fat from the top of your thumb to the bottom of it is about one tablespoon so that can be considered of that exchange as well so we can go look at that so great I'm so glad that so going off of that when it comes to consume meals and timing of meals it's really important when especially when you're taking fast acting insulin because what happens is when you take insulin you're supposed to be eating 15 minutes before after you take your insulin so it to make sure that works and that you don't go into a state of hyper will say I see though cuz you're not eating any good though so it doesn't so it's really important to so I want to ask you because I know you have a really really busy day because you are working at the shop that you say yeah we work that and that normally you don't have time for breaks and stuff like that so I want to ask you what time of the day you can would be a good way to add meals or snacks to your everyday schedule
3351,high_067,client,well I don't really eat so maybe in between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner preferably Porsche
3352,high_067,counsellor,great great because that's actually a great record bomb great suggestion because it's really important especially because you want to make sure that your glucose cells are intact that you're eating less than four hours in between meals so a lot of times people tend to eat either three big meals or they tend to eat six small meals so whatever you want you choose that go as well with your work schedule totally up to you just making sure that you're monitoring it and making sure you're taking it with your insulin before time so going with that I wanted to ask you at four o'clock so what kind of needles are doing at that time because that's really
3353,high_067,client,well that's right before I go in to teach my class so nothing too big maybe just like banana
3354,high_067,counsellor,okay um it's not a realistic goal for you do you think you will have trying to eat that's not during that period of time
3355,high_067,client,yeah just something smaller
3356,high_067,counsellor,okay absolutely so when it comes to bananas this is specially really important roots are also considered a carbohydrate exchange about 1/2 a cup and we time to think of a banana one full exchange so just letting you know that a half a cup which is about a half a banana it's one carbon straight so if you're eating one full banana it's considered to carb exchanges but throughout this whole process you'll learn a lot about different kinds of exchanges and how to tell which one some people get really really good at it so and if you have any questions you go that way so going on is there any other areas of improvement you would like to do for snacking or anything like that
3357,high_067,client,I feel like I just need to get in a routine and start snacking more so I can keep consistent
3358,high_067,counsellor,okay so where's another time of day where you would like to add back
3359,high_067,client,well I do have a light breakfast and then I don't eat till lunch so probably in between there
3360,high_067,counsellor,okay what time we thinking about
3361,high_067,client,10:00
3362,high_067,counsellor,okay and what kind of sweets do you like to eat during that time or like in the morning
3363,high_067,client,in the mornings I can't really do anything too sweet so maybe some vegetables
3364,high_067,counsellor,vegetables what kind of apples do you like
3365,high_067,client,like carrots celery I love cucumbers
3366,high_067,counsellor,okay so would you like to have what kind of snacks would you like two halves would you like I like to have a little vegetables or what are you looking for when it comes ideally
3367,high_067,client,yeah well I need something fast and on the go because I'm always moving I'm always going around I don't really have time to sit and settle and eat
3368,high_067,counsellor,okay
3369,high_067,client,so I need stuff that packages easily that I can just take with me
3370,high_067,counsellor,okay
3371,high_067,client,so there's actually I don't know if you heard but we have these I grocery stores sometimes they have these great snack packs so sometimes they come with like a little bit of hummus and vegetables do you like oh well it's something you can definitely try or what do you think of like peeler perfect so peanut butter no vegetables I'll be great for the morning so that's great they made that connection that's awesome these are really great changes and we definitely I'm really excited to work with this with you so that's not the time we have today but before we leave I have these handouts for you so this is another alternative method instead of the hand method but it's a really great way of planning so that half your plate being notables 1/4 being starch and another fourth being meats and there's also a method we talked about the portion sizes and a little meals to calm pattern and before you leave I also want to ask you what did you learn today so I learned a lot of carb exchanges and to really watch those method which is one cup one meat portion and your Samus fat okay and then also just about really spreading out my food and working to eat more consistently
3372,high_067,counsellor,okay and I have a quick quiz for you what does fifteen grams of carbohydrates equal
3373,high_067,client,oneexchange
3374,high_067,counsellor,perfect and what is one banana equal to
3375,high_067,client,go to exchanges
3376,high_067,counsellor,"Correct, that's awesome. I'm really excited to work with you. But I also have this great information about type one diabetes. So it will tell you about different kinds of carbohydrates are considered like breads, what we're talking about that, milk, fruit, and sweets. Also why it's important. And also there's a little list over here which is a food journal that you can use. So for the next few days or the next month, I would really like for you to see what kind of changes you're making and what kind of goals you would like to set to move forward, especially when it comes to your meals. So just write them down. And I plan to meet with you in about a month so we can talk about your"
3377,high_068,counsellor,Oh so how are you today
3378,high_068,client,not bad I guess Thanks pretty good actually yeah
3379,high_068,counsellor,well let me introduce myself properly my name's Colin I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients who are thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you by what name would you prefer mr. Jones
3380,high_068,client,no no I'm I'm Nathan I mean Nate well Nate and my friends call me Nathan so so
3381,high_068,counsellor,well you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that but sure thinking about that as a coach would would help
3382,high_068,client,yeah
3383,high_068,counsellor,so I wondered it to get started if as a few things that we just lay out before we get going
3384,high_068,client,yeah
3385,high_068,counsellor,so my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and I do want to point out that anything that you say to us will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly I do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that that it sounds as though you rather put yourself at risk imminent risk or putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that
3386,high_068,client,okay
3387,high_068,counsellor,is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about
3388,high_068,client,no I I understand it sounds good I mean I understand so yeah yeah
3389,high_068,counsellor,well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone when we're doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you brings you here
3390,high_068,client,well I've kind of been messing up the last little while and I've kind of gotten myself into some trouble because because of that
3391,high_068,counsellor,tell me more about that
3392,high_068,client,well I'm sorry I'm a bit nervous sir
3393,high_068,counsellor,"Sure, it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this."
3394,high_068,client,yeah okay well I've had some job interviews and I've kind of I've missed those and and you know I've really not been too happy with myself the last little while you know I'm kind of getting angry really quickly and and I mean people that I love and like people I normally don't get angry so you know it's it's kind of bothersome
3395,high_068,counsellor,so quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting Eretz of all we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities or some work opportunities
3396,high_068,client,well yeah yeah because I've been kind of partying hard and well I mean my wife gets upset about that and dicky so
3397,high_068,counsellor,could you tell me more is you've been partying your wife's been getting upset with you
3398,high_068,client,well the thing is okay so I'm I don't have a job I'm unemployed and you know I've got some free time on my hands and I'll be honest with you I've been kind of little bit down because of that and I thought you know my friend's been trying to get my spirits up and so you know we've been out partying and drinking and stuff like that but that's not been the only problem that's the thing well I mean you know drinking's been a problem I've been drinking too much
3399,high_068,counsellor,so you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much
3400,high_068,client,yeah but but that's not the only thing I mean I'll be honest with you I've been I've been doing cocaine as well and and then you know of course that leads to more drinking and and you know more cocaine so I'm I'm just trying to think of you know maybe I should cut back on the coke and
3401,high_068,counsellor,time back on the cold
3402,high_068,client,well
3403,high_068,counsellor,you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not have been missing job opportunities you've talked about getting irritable and Anastas and um it being different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more partying a bit more and also using some cocaine I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today if and what would be good for you to talk about now
3404,high_068,client,well I mean well yeah that's that's about it but I guess it'd be kind of like trying to get the the the coke situation a bit under control and because it's getting out of control
3405,high_068,counsellor,out of control
3406,high_068,client,yeah I know some people that are are worse than me
3407,high_068,counsellor,but thinking a bit worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold five things
3408,high_068,client,I guess the worst thing is that you know I've been doing the coke and and well okay I'll tell you about this one situation that it's kind of scared me a little bit is that you know I've done some coke and some booze and like lots of it and I remember this one time I was in the car in the backseat and and the driver had done kind of the same thing you know he'd done some coke and some booze and and it was is it was pretty scary and you know and I was really really high and he was really high and we were driving and it kind of just hit me and it was scary so
3409,high_068,counsellor,so the sliding it's very scary
3410,high_068,client,yeah well I mean I'll be honest with you there's there's been other times that you know I've kind of woken up the next day I mean and I don't even remember
3411,high_068,counsellor,so it's not remembering and that I must be scary too it's a to not remember things
3412,high_068,client,yeah I guess not remembering this has been that's definitely scary and then you know being in situations where it's been really dangerous sometimes it gets foggy and and and you know this is gonna sound kind of silly but you know sometimes the only way I can find out what I've actually done is by going to my Facebook and then finding out because other people have been talking about it or I've seen pictures and stuff like that and that kind of jogs my memory and then when I start to see those things I kind of wish I hadn't done them so
3413,high_068,counsellor,so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested that it's from Europe for you copious that you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you
3414,high_068,client,yeah yeah and you know I guess because I've been putting other people at risk too and I you know I love I love my wife and and and I love my family and I and my friends and I want to do something that's it's right you know that I'm really gonna regret
3415,high_068,counsellor,your family your wife your friends are all really important to you
3416,high_068,client,very very important
3417,high_068,counsellor,thinking about importance Nathan how important would it be for you to to make changes to your copious
3418,high_068,client,well I mean eight I don't know a you know eight out of ten if that's you know
3419,high_068,counsellor,that makes a lot sense
3420,high_068,client,yeah
3421,high_068,counsellor,it's good to use imaginary skills absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and do you know
3422,high_068,client,yeah
3423,high_068,counsellor,okay now so you're roughly eight
3424,high_068,client,yeah
3425,high_068,counsellor,I mean so it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let's see a four
3426,high_068,client,well I guess because it's been been causing me problems and you know I've missed some job interviews and and I don't even know you know kind of what I've done you know until the next day or you know You Know Who I am I you know I've kind of been been hurt you know by my friends and stuff like that and and you know in influence I guess in a bad way from from them and you know and then of course then you know I've been having problems you know sleeping and stuff like that and you know not getting sleep and sleeping properly and you know and then all of that kind of falls back and it's upsetting my family and
3427,high_068,counsellor,it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you two to think about changing
3428,high_068,client,yeah yeah I mean one of the reasons why I come here is I'm thinking because the cocaine in my mind the cocaine is the issue
3429,high_068,counsellor,mm-hmm
3430,high_068,client,and I'm because it's it's a vicious cycle with the cocaine and and drinking and I'm hoping that maybe if I can somehow resolve that then maybe maybe like I won't be drinking as much like I'm okay I'm not an alcoholic I mean and you know just it's it's a problem with the cocaine
3431,high_068,counsellor,so and certainly labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what do what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work
3432,high_068,client,I be honest with you I don't know much I mean I've read a few minor things on the internet but I mean I get confused about that and
3433,high_068,counsellor,"I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together, which is reasonably common among cocaine users, what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine are mixed together, they form a third substance. It actually has some surprising effects. It can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do. Sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it."
3434,high_068,client,Wow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that
3435,high_068,counsellor,it's it's surprising
3436,high_068,client,well you know see the thing is is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and
3437,high_068,counsellor,what else do you make of it
3438,high_068,client,well I guess it means that I really need to stop one of them and he ain't gonna be the beer I guess
3439,high_068,counsellor,so for you if you were to stop one it would be the cocaine
3440,high_068,client,it's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine mix like you say they do it and all that
3441,high_068,counsellor,so thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you but I want to know how confident you are and maybe again in an imaginary scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the most confident one is the least confident
3442,high_068,client,well I mean I'm be honest is yeah I'm not that confident about it I'm I don't know on a scale of one to ten maybe four
3443,high_068,counsellor,four
3444,high_068,client,maybe maybe five four I don't know like yeah
3445,high_068,counsellor,four so there's somewhat competent then I wonder why it's four unless you know a one
3446,high_068,client,I sure I could stop I mean it's just that you know there'd be a lot of temptations you know when I go with my friends I mean a lot of my friends use but I guess
3447,high_068,counsellor,so a lot of you your friends use and it could be quite tempt and and you're sure you could stop
3448,high_068,client,well yeah I think so I mean I mean I could tell them I suppose
3449,high_068,counsellor,so there are some things you could do to help yourself stop them
3450,high_068,client,yeah I guess so I mean I can avoid certain bars where I know it's easily available
3451,high_068,counsellor,and these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I honestly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to start I'm I did mention earlier that I had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us to maybe if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions but how would that feel for you that work
3452,high_068,client,okay yeah that's okay
3453,high_068,counsellor,yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly you become concerned about your recent users you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some pictures off at risks and and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which I guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you
3454,high_069,counsellor,Barbara Roberts
3455,high_069,client,yes
3456,high_069,counsellor,hello there my name is dr. Bedi I'm one of the new GPS in the practice first of all what would you like me to call you
3457,high_069,client,well you can call me Barbara that'll be fine
3458,high_069,counsellor,okay that's fine okay so Barbara I'm seeing you today but I think it'
3459,high_069,client,s usually dr. Brown that's seeing she was that right
3460,high_069,counsellor,yes Dr. Brown's my doctor okay what is it that's brought you to see me today
3461,high_069,client,well I've come about my tummy problem I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it and I thought perhaps I'd come and see you to see if you could help all
3462,high_069,counsellor,right okay can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems
3463,high_069,client,um well I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time it very often feels bloated I I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes and other times it stops it's a real stabbing feeling I often have the urge to go to the toilet and and I pass very smelly wind
3464,high_069,counsellor,so quite a few symptoms there and some of them sound quite troublesome to you
3465,high_069,client,yes
3466,high_069,counsellor,okay and how long has this been going on
3467,high_069,client,well I I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea and and I don't think my stomach's have have been really right since then
3468,high_069,counsellor,mm-hmm okay okay so you think it began about four years ago after this holiday
3469,high_069,client,yes
3470,high_069,counsellor,okay and what what sort of treatments have you tried for this before
3471,high_069,client,well dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning but I've been to the health shop and and they've been really helpful they've given me lots of different tablets and medicines
3472,high_069,counsellor,right
3473,high_069,client,for different things now or an imodium right I have imodium in my handbag all the time just in case right
3474,high_069,counsellor,so these different tablets that you've got from the the herbal shop how are you taking them
3475,high_069,client,oh well different tablets you know I don't have the same problem every day so I'll take some tablets for certain symptoms
3476,high_069,counsellor,right
3477,high_069,client,other tablets for other things
3478,high_069,counsellor,so my am i right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis and what you're going to take demanding of what your stomach's doing
3479,high_069,client,yeah
3480,high_069,counsellor,okay okay and what about tests have you had any tests for these problems
3481,high_069,client,yes I had in the early days I had a gastroschisis what are they a
3482,high_069,counsellor,gastroscopy
3483,high_069,client,how's that the tubes down to the top
3484,high_069,counsellor,okay
3485,high_069,client,and at the same time I had a barium enema
3486,high_069,counsellor,right
3487,high_069,client,that was very uncomfortable
3488,high_069,counsellor,okay
3489,high_069,client,but now I've tried what are you I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that that they didn't find anything he's he's just not sent me for any more that's it now as far as he's concerned sent me back to the doctor
3490,high_069,counsellor,right sounds as though you're not happy with that
3491,high_069,client,well you know I think that actually the NHS is running out of money aren't they and he's decided that I've had enough tests my hand you know if you go on the internet there's loads of tests that he could have said before
3492,high_069,counsellor,right
3493,high_069,client,if I had a bit more money I'd go private why I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it right
3494,high_069,counsellor,so you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way of
3495,high_069,client,notice he's not just loads more he could do I'm sure
3496,high_069,counsellor,right okay it sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach you've tried a lot of tablets some prescribed some herbal remedies and you've had some investigations but you're not entirely happy that you even been investigated thoroughly enough is that is that about a toast if I got the story right okay and can ask you Barbara how is all of this affecting you day to day how has it affecting your life
3497,high_069,client,while it's had quite quite big impact I mean the first thing the biggest thing I suppose is that I I went from being full-time to part-time at work I just couldn't sit all day comfortably and so in part-time but in the end I thought how about a year ago I stopped work altogether
3498,high_069,counsellor,right
3499,high_069,client,and I miss that I miss the girls we used to used to go out at least once a week night to the pictures or Pro drink that's one thing
3500,high_069,counsellor,though about something you quite enjoyed
3501,high_069,client,yes
3502,high_069,counsellor,all right
3503,high_069,client,yes yes we just have a laugh right okay I used to go to swing in shape I used to go to an exercise class that was um I missed the exercise actually that was once a week but you know the thing was I wasn't comfortable never felt quite right doing all this exercise I was always worried I was going to be taken short or so I stopped that
3504,high_069,counsellor,right
3505,high_069,client,um then well my husband I used to go out for meals
3506,high_069,counsellor,mm-hmm
3507,high_069,client,that's another thing we don't do anymore now
3508,high_069,counsellor,right
3509,high_069,client,hmm yes quite a few things really
3510,high_069,counsellor,yeah it does it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed quite a lot because of these symptoms it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do
3511,high_069,client,hmm
3512,high_069,counsellor,right what is it you'd spend your average day doing now
3513,high_069,client,well I put her around the house I spent perhaps a little bit too much time watching I've got a bit hooked on daytime television I have to say they draw you in don't they
3514,high_069,counsellor,yes sir I do
3515,high_069,client,I read a bit the whole magazines but generally I'm at home
3516,high_069,counsellor,right okay okay and have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example have there been any times when things have been better for you
3517,high_069,client,well last year my son got married and I have to say I was worried that that I wouldn't have to cope with it that I wouldn't be feeling well enough surprisingly enough I was in good form I think it was about three weeks in the summer getting ready for it and the whole who are of the wedding but I was in good really good form for that yeah that was a good time
3518,high_069,counsellor,right and how were you Tommy symptoms then
3519,high_069,client,I hardly noticed them yes it it seemed to clear up
3520,high_069,counsellor,nice sounds good right that's interesting hmm and are there any times when your symptoms bother you more it seemed particularly bad
3521,high_069,client,um well it's I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment it's particularly uncomfortable I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away he he travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times a month and that's not it it was very often not good then I have to say why does he
3522,high_069,counsellor,notice it they're worse when your husband's not around mmm
3523,high_069,client,maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more I don't know when he's not there
3524,high_069,counsellor,right I know you've been seeing dr. Brown about this for the last few years what is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you
3525,high_069,client,well he's he thinks it's all in my head my nose he's yeah he says it's stress why it's okay
3526,high_069,counsellor,and what do you think
3527,high_069,client,well I mean it can't all be in my head I get too much physical pain or it to be in my head I mean it's real it's it's a real pain
3528,high_069,counsellor,mm-hmm and have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it
3529,high_069,client,well I mean I I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up in the early stages but I think I mean sometimes I think it's IBS a friend of Mines got that and it sounds similar and then other times I think I wonder if it's an ulcer on a really bad day I start to think it might be cancer
3530,high_069,counsellor,right
3531,high_069,client,um my mother-in-law my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a growth that the doctor didn't investigate
3532,high_069,counsellor,right
3533,high_069,client,but by the time they'd found it it was the size of a football and it was it was too late to operate then so you know when I go to bed at night now and I just feel and make sure there's nothing different going on
3534,high_069,counsellor,right
3535,high_069,client,and yeah I worry about that
3536,high_069,counsellor,so you're kind of prodding having a feel at night oh you see if you can feel anything
3537,high_069,client,yeah I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there you know
3538,high_069,counsellor,right okay okay so just to make sure that I've got the story straight you've you've seen dr. Brown for a couple of years you've you've tried a variety of medications some prescribed some from the herbal shop and none of them really made a great deal of difference you've had some investigations but you're perhaps feeling you've not had enough investigations and times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer is that have I got a story right
3539,high_069,client,yes yeah I say so
3540,high_069,counsellor,okay Bob well what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today
3541,high_069,client,well I thought you know you're a new doctor here and you've just finished your medical training I wondered whether you know with new eyes and new way of looking at at the problem might you probably know about different tests new tests that my doctor doesn't know about you know new developments all
3542,high_069,counsellor,right
3543,high_069,client,so perhaps you could send me for some different tests
3544,high_069,counsellor,right right so you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests
3545,high_069,client,hmm well I think this there's got to be something that tests might right reveal
3546,high_069,counsellor,right okay well I think Barbara having having heard your story and heard about the symptoms I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you and the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years and they've not shown anything and your symptoms haven't really changed that much so it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know so it would be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests
3547,high_069,client,so it's like do you think it's all in my head then you're going to be like dr. Brown you think I'm imagining all of this
3548,high_069,counsellor,no I think that you clearly have pain and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they're clearly getting in the way of your life causing you a lot of disability I guess I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body sometimes these things can go together I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and then when your husband's away which is something you don't like very much sometimes somehow is your symptoms then will seem greater so I guess what I'm wondering Barbara is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind and what's going on in your life and and how much you symptoms trouble you do you think that's a possibility
3549,high_069,client,well I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain
3550,high_069,counsellor,I'm not saying that the pains in your mind. I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you and we've tried investigations and we've drawn a blank really with those. None of those have really helped you. I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.
3551,high_069,client,what sort of approach
3552,high_069,counsellor,well I guess thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years your life has really changed it seems to have really shrunk down and it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of is that right
3553,high_069,client,well I just can't do them yeah I can't do them anymore
3554,high_069,counsellor,and I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them but I wonder if in a funny way what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you
3555,high_069,client,oh I don't know I don't know
3556,high_069,counsellor,I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things you know even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking and the fact that you you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth for sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse. I guess
3557,high_069,client,hmm
3558,high_069,counsellor,what would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference
3559,high_069,client,well two or three months is a long time if there is something going on I mean that's what happened to my mother-in-law you know they left her and didn't spot it and
3560,high_069,counsellor,well I guess if we if we did decide to work together like this in this new approach I'd be seeing you regularly we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate but if they stay the same then you know we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing now would that sound
3561,high_069,client,so what are you saying then that I should come back and see you
3562,high_069,counsellor,"I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you booked in for a double slot next week, that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. Perhaps if you could also bring your tablets in or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara?"
3563,high_069,client,okay well to make an appointment for next week yeah come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more
3564,high_069,counsellor,yes I think so I think that would be a good a good start
3565,high_069,client,and I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking yeah I don't bring all the bottles down
3566,high_069,counsellor,okay all right okay all right so shows thank you again next week
3567,high_069,client,I'll make an appointment for next week illness
3568,high_069,counsellor,all right Thank You Barbara
3569,high_069,client,okay bye
3570,high_070,counsellor,hi Michael it's good to see ya well glad you came in today when I douse up
3571,high_070,client,well I came back here because I had to I had to make an appointment so I could get my prescription for my blood pressure medicine refilled and they wouldn't do it it wouldn't refill it it's a drugstore unless I came back here so
3572,high_070,counsellor,you're you're angry what
3573,high_070,client,well I'm not angry at you but I'm angry at the situation and I gotta come back in here take time off from work just to get that prescription filled but but you know you do what you got to do and
3574,high_070,counsellor,well I appreciate your bringing that up that is does sound frustrating but by coming in it gives us a chance to to sit down and and and talk and see how things are going with the medication which is what I'm most concerned about I know we started at about three months ago or so and I am real interested to hear how you're how you're doing on
3575,high_070,client,well uh yeah whenever I get my blood pressure checked at the drugstore it looks like I'm that it's working and that respect but it does seem to take away all my energy you know
3576,high_070,counsellor,kind of fatigued
3577,high_070,client,yeah yeah my I got no get up and go if you know what I mean
3578,high_070,counsellor,so kind of has taken the wind out of your sails
3579,high_070,client,absolutely yeah
3580,high_070,counsellor,how long have you noticed that
3581,high_070,client,oh I don't know I at least since I've been on this medication at least that long
3582,high_070,counsellor,yeah doesn't sound like it's working well too working too well for you have you tell me about how you're taking the medication have you taking it very regular
3583,high_070,client,oh yeah I take it I take it just like it says take it on the bottle you know I take it every morning when I get up
3584,high_070,counsellor,okay so you've been pretty consistent and taken
3585,high_070,client,the all yes
3586,high_070,counsellor,anything else going on in terms of symptoms no just this overall lack of energy which I know my wife doesn't particularly care for your wife coming a little bit more about how it affects the relationship between the two of you
3587,high_070,client,well as I say I get up and go got up and went and there's not much going on between the two of us like there used to be
3588,high_070,counsellor,so sexual performance is not as good as it as it might be
3589,high_070,client,nope but I think it's because of that damn medicine
3590,high_070,counsellor,so does this sound like something that you want to continue or should we talk about possibly other other options for you it sounds like it's kind of affecting your life negatively well
3591,high_070,client,yeah yeah but you know I I'm worried about my blood pressure because my my mother had a stroke not long ago and I know it was so they told us it was because of her high blood pressure so I don't want that to happen to me
3592,high_070,counsellor,so you're concerned about having a stroke
3593,high_070,client,well yeah I mean would you be you know it sort of runs in families I think
3594,high_070,counsellor,yeah so taking care of your blood pressure is is very important to you
3595,high_070,client,yeah yeah absolutely
3596,high_070,counsellor,again it doesn't sound like this particular medicines working out too well for you if it's okay I could talk to you about possibly changing the medication so on the one hand we'd be keeping your blood pressure under control but on the other hand we wouldn't be causing these types of side effects hopefully would that be okay
3597,high_070,client,well are you talking about on more medications or just a different medication
3598,high_070,counsellor,yeah so uh I think probably it sounds to me like probably changing medications at this point as a start we can always add another medication later if that becomes necessary
3599,high_070,client,yeah well I'm not real interested in adding any more but if changing it it would keep my blood pressure down but not take away all my energy than I might that give better idea
3600,high_070,counsellor,so you'd at least be willing to try a change and see how that goes
3601,high_070,client,yeah yeah I know well
3602,high_070,counsellor,if it's okay I can tell you about a group of medications that I I like but if but first if it's okay that they give you a kind of my rationale for using that medication to start with so you know one of the things you'd mentioned to me was some of the financial concerns and the medication that you're on is pretty dirt-cheap and for most people at this dose particularly a low dose because you have mild hypertension most of the time it doesn't have many side effects obviously for you that was different does that make sense
3603,high_070,client,yeah
3604,high_070,counsellor,yeah so the medication I'm thinking about is something called an ACE inhibitor ACE inhibitors are very very well tolerated and occasionally people will get a dry hacky cough with them but it's fairly rare but there's very low risk of side effects in terms of sexual side effects in particular and most people as a matter of fact it's one of the the drugs that actually helps your heart beat a little bit stronger and better and many people don't have any kind of a decrease in their energy so how does that sound
3605,high_070,client,yeah it sounds though it sounds like a good idea if it still controls my blood pressure but doesn't take away my energy it sounds like a good idea
3606,high_070,counsellor,okay so what other things can you tell me about that might affect your blood pressure
3607,high_070,client,uh-oh uh-oh my work is sometimes stressful and some of the people I work with kind of drive me a little batty occasionally and I I don't know if it I don't really know if that it causes my blood pressure to go up or not but it certainly could I guess
3608,high_070,counsellor,so there's some stressors at work
3609,high_070,client,yeah
3610,high_070,counsellor,and if it's okay I'm going to write down some of these things that as we talk through them so what else can affect blood pressure that you know of
3611,high_070,client,um well you know just mostly from watching TV shows I guess I am aware that alcohol and I drink some a moment that alcohol has some effect on blood pressure I think it might even say so on the label though I'm not sure
3612,high_070,counsellor,it can't it can't anything else you can think of
3613,high_070,client,no
3614,high_070,counsellor,well sometimes sometimes weight can be an issue and explain this little tool to you this is for what it's worth called a agenda mapping so it sounds like there's a number of things that you know of and then we can talk about that affect your blood pressure you mentioned stress and an alcohol and we talked about weight certainly you know blood pressure medication can affect you there and I would say another big one might be exercise does all that makes sense
3615,high_070,client,well yeah
3616,high_070,counsellor,so we could we can talk about a lot of these things with which one might you want to talk about and if we need to we can set up for appointment and talk about this more if we run out of time but
3617,high_070,client,well um exercise I'm I actually like to exercise
3618,high_070,counsellor,and tell me about the exercise that you're doing
3619,high_070,client,well I play golf and walk the golf course
3620,high_070,counsellor,so you carry your bag or do I drag it along on a pull cart
3621,high_070,client,my wife says that that doesn't count as exercise but I say try it yourself it is exercise
3622,high_070,counsellor,it is exercise it is exercise Michael look at your your weight when we came in
3623,high_070,client,yeah
3624,high_070,counsellor,and you were about 160 or so yeah which is actually according to your BMI body mass index in the in the overweight range how do you feel about that
3625,high_070,client,well I don't think I'm overweight
3626,high_070,counsellor,yeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about 15 to 20 pounds
3627,high_070,client,15 or 20 pounds
3628,high_070,counsellor,yes 15 or 20 pounds
3629,high_070,client,I haven't weighed that since I was in high school
3630,high_070,counsellor,I understand I understand but you know I'm not saying that we need to lose 20 pounds sometimes just a loss of 10 pounds can make a tremendous impact on your on your blood pressure
3631,high_070,client,okay
3632,high_070,counsellor,so 10 pounds sounds like something that might be negotiable
3633,high_070,client,5
3634,high_070,counsellor,5 is the number
3635,high_070,client,okay
3636,high_070,counsellor,let's go you do with thigh
3637,high_070,client,okay I think I can do 5
3638,high_070,counsellor,all right so if you were to want to lose 5 pounds how would you go about it
3639,high_070,client,I'd probably go back to the gym
3640,high_070,counsellor,as that worked in the past
3641,high_070,client,yeah I mean I used to go to the gym and work out a lot and uh I've done it for a while but I guess if if I'm I'm sure I could lose 5 pounds if I wanted to
3642,high_070,counsellor,and that would actually kind of take care of two of these things right your weight and your exercise both of those would have a really positive effect I think on your on your blood pressure
3643,high_070,client,okay well
3644,high_070,counsellor,so we've talked about changing your medication stopping the medication you're on changing you to this ACE inhibitor and then perhaps looking at the weight and going getting back to the gym and starting an exercise program is that about right
3645,high_070,client,well what would it take for me to not have to take the medication at all
3646,high_070,counsellor,at all
3647,high_070,client,yeah I mean if I did enough exercise and lost enough weight would you not what I not need to take the medicine
3648,high_070,counsellor,I I really wonder if you would I think that's an excellent question and if you're motivated to lose that kind of weight I'm with you I can't leave I this good I can lose five pounds well it may it may take more than five pounds to get the desired effect on your blood pressure that's really getting back down into that normal weight range if you will in that one 35 to 40 range probably
3649,high_070,client,I I just want to make sure I understand if I if if I lose uh five pounds and I do it through exercise that I could you would recommend that I try going without the medicine for a while too and see what happens
3650,high_070,counsellor,I don't think I'm ready to go there yet Michael but it sounds to me like you want to get off of your medication
3651,high_070,client,yeah if I can yeah
3652,high_070,counsellor,well it there it's a blood pressure rate that you are right now blood pressure number that you are right now I probably wouldn't recommend that that that's going to take a plan for us to work out over probably a period of months so that you could one lose a little bit more weight two exercise really regularly we might want to talk about the alcohol um can I ask you how much your you're drinking now our regular basis
3653,high_070,client,two or three beers a day
3654,high_070,counsellor,two or three
3655,high_070,client,yeah
3656,high_070,counsellor,it is okay I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about alcohol and its effect on blood pressure Merryn research has shown that for men more than two drinks a day and for women more than one drink a day really can significantly impact your blood pressure negatively it raises blood pressure how does that sit with you
3657,high_070,client,you're saying two or three
3658,high_070,counsellor,more than two more than three
3659,high_070,client,okay so two is still considered aa safe and regard to blood pressure
3660,high_070,counsellor,that's what most of the research shows
3661,high_070,client,okay I'll do two
3662,high_070,counsellor,you'll do two okay and you said that you did two three every day
3663,high_070,client,most every day yeah sometimes a little more on the weekend I guess
3664,high_070,counsellor,can you think of any ways to maybe cut back on that to where you wouldn't be getting as much alcohol in your system on a regular basis
3665,high_070,client,oh yeah I guess I could you know I mean uh I you know I don't I I don't have a drinking problem so I could take a day or two and not drink at all if but if if two a day doesn't hurt my blood pressure um I think I could go with that
3666,high_070,counsellor,so two a day um keep in mind too there are significant amounts of calories involved and alcohol particularly beer
3667,high_070,client,I suppose I could drink Light beer
3668,high_070,counsellor,light beer doesn't appeal to you
3669,high_070,client,might as well not drink beer at all you drink Light beer but I suppose if I suppose I could do that
3670,high_070,counsellor,"Scale of zero to ten, zero being not willing at all to do that, ten being very willing to do that, where do you think you"
3671,high_070,client,probably about it I
3672,high_070,counsellor,why did you say a five and not a three or four
3673,high_070,client,just because uh you know doc habits are hard to break you know and it usually don't drink Light beer and so it would be a change it would be something different but uh well you know I'm willing to give it a try
3674,high_070,counsellor,tell me the good things about cutting back on alcohol and maybe switching to light beer talking about the good things
3675,high_070,client,well I did you know obviously a good thing is I'd probably lose weight which is what we're trying to do here
3676,high_070,counsellor,so you'd lose weight
3677,high_070,client,uh and there there may be other things about alcohol that has something to do with blood pressure that I did not understand but but I suppose it would help keep my blood pressure down and my weight low or if I didn't drink as much beer or if I drank light beer and so that's the good side the bad side is I don't like it as much
3678,high_070,counsellor,"On a scale of zero to ten, zero being not very important and ten being very important, how important is it for you to get better control of your blood pressure?"
3679,high_070,client,very important I put that up really pretty high I'll give that a nine
3680,high_070,counsellor,so in terms of making a change what are some of the things that you'd be willing to do in order to make that happen
3681,high_070,client,well you know I'm willing to do the things but most of what we've just talked about
3682,high_070,counsellor,which are
3683,high_070,client,um drinking Light beer drinking no more than two beers a day going to the gym again and sticking with a different medicine for a while
3684,high_070,counsellor,okay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go
3685,high_070,client,yeah I think I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my blood pressure at a level that doesn't concern me and if this is what it takes I'm going to give this a try
3686,high_070,counsellor,so one more scale in terms of your readiness to make to do this zero being not ready at all and ten being ready where would you fall on that
3687,high_070,client,six and a half
3688,high_070,counsellor,six and a half and watch six and a happen and not two or three
3689,high_070,client,because I know when I walk out of here that if I keep doing what I'm doing I I'm either going to have to live with the blood pressure medicine that takes all my energy away and I don't like that or I'm going to have to let my blood pressure get real high and I know that can cause all sorts of bad things to happen
3690,high_070,counsellor,so you're really worried again about the health consequences of not keeping your blood pressure under control
3691,high_070,client,people keep telling me that high blood pressure causes all sorts of bad things to happen so yes I am concerned about that
3692,high_070,counsellor,so if it's okay I'm going to put this in your record that we talked about well we're certainly going to switch your medication but you're going to be working on losing some weight going back to the gym cutting down on your beer usage and switching to light beer is there anything I missed
3693,high_070,client,five pounds
3694,high_070,counsellor,five pounds that's the number now I'd like to see you back and about let's call it a month let's see back in a month
3695,high_070,client,I'm the five pounds going by then
3696,high_070,counsellor,my pounds will be gone and we'll see how things are going and probably talk about this some more and see how successful you've been with this plan and then we'll go from there
3697,high_071,counsellor,hello Becky
3698,high_071,client,hello
3699,high_071,counsellor,my name is Jenny ponds
3700,high_071,client,nice to meet you
3701,high_071,counsellor,good to meet you and I hear that you met with dr. Johnson and you were looking at your concerns about wage is that right
3702,high_071,client,yes
3703,high_071,counsellor,okay and how has that been for you
3704,high_071,client,very frustrating
3705,high_071,counsellor,uh-huh
3706,high_071,client,I've been trying to get my weight under control over 15 years boy but
3707,high_071,counsellor,it sounds like you've been working at it but this the years go by it gets pretty pretty frustrating
3708,high_071,client,yeah
3709,high_071,counsellor,and and how um is your weight affecting life for you what's life like sort of where you are
3710,high_071,client,um well it crepe lot of pain I'm having problems with my knees recently had knee surgery me so it's really I know the physical pain has shown up that's that's the newest thing you know before it was about what I felt you know what I might look like now it's about how I'm feeling I'm older much older and the pain in my body the sluggishness
3711,high_071,counsellor,so as the years have gone by it's it's it's becoming more and more of a problem
3712,high_071,client,yes
3713,high_071,counsellor,yeah yeah okay and any other sense of how it's affecting the pain course is a very noticeable you know subject but anything else that you experience
3714,high_071,client,um like things you're able to do we able to do the same sorts of things well some of that I attribute to age but
3715,high_071,counsellor,oh yeah right the cardiovascular as well yep
3716,high_071,client,yep yep so the biggest one that motivates me is the pain right now because get you away from it
3717,high_071,counsellor,and you're in you know that if you lost some weight that then you'd have less pressure on those knees in you can be you
3718,high_071,client,can get around towns would make it too hot you know it doesn't take much just to to feel that difference unfortunately I'm going in the wrong direction
3719,high_071,counsellor,yeah well it sounds as though you feel pretty strongly about this that you've been your back in here really wanting us to help you get something going
3720,high_071,client,yes
3721,high_071,counsellor,so first off I have to hear a ruler rubens and if if you might indicate if you wish from a scale of 0 to 10 just how strong your conviction is about this being a problem you know just as you're describing it the pain and the concerns about your cardiovascular you know all of the ways that it's affecting your life okay from zero that it's really not that much of a problem to 10 this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed
3722,high_071,client,okay
3723,high_071,counsellor,so where would you put it
3724,high_071,client,well I would say that hmm intellectually I'm probably at a nine and physically I'm in the tab
3725,high_071,counsellor,hey all right
3726,high_071,client,yep so physically my body telling me every day
3727,high_071,counsellor,why you say
3728,high_071,client,my mind just this needs to be
3729,high_071,counsellor,and on what what do you think your mind is you know what the concerns are that your mind has are the are any doubts or anything
3730,high_071,client,well I'd say that that it's less because I because of a frustration because it feels like I ok I'm not committing to doing what needs to be done to get rid of the pain and take care of the body so it just doesn't feel like my intellect not knowledge but intellect
3731,high_071,counsellor,or emotional baggage with your body
3732,high_071,client,yeah or otherwise wouldn't I be doing it
3733,high_071,counsellor,yeah it's very close though
3734,high_071,client,it's much closer than the business much closer than it's ever been I mean intellectually have been that's what I've been stalling with cuz I've known what to do or thought I knew what to do and I would tinker with it but I didn't make the commitment and now my body says you gotta get it or you're going to be down to the count
3735,high_071,counsellor,yeah absolutely um and nine so that's really quite high too
3736,high_071,client,okay
3737,high_071,counsellor,attends the top of the scale with your body but nine with you not just your thoughts and feelings about it so what makes it a night and not a seven or an eight
3738,high_071,client,um the fact that something on my mind every day
3739,high_071,counsellor,hmm
3740,high_071,client,and I know that making the choices is coming up for me I just haven't made the break through like I'll I'll realize that I've done something that was a good back right after the sack yeah I need to realize it before the back and then like could make the change uptake
3741,high_071,counsellor,yeah that sounds like that's a source of frustration
3742,high_071,client,oh yeah
3743,high_071,counsellor,yeah yeahs
3744,high_071,client,out of an internal fight
3745,high_071,counsellor,yeah yeah if I could share a perspective that I have about giving what goes on with our mind and our body you'd be interested
3746,high_071,client,yo head okay
3747,high_071,counsellor,well and this is just my theory but I really has a sense that you know we've got an appetite center in their brain right I'm part of our brain that regulates it might be getting messages about how much energy we have available probably a lot of other things too but basically that's monitoring our body to make sure that we're getting enough nutrition I think one of the challenges as we gradually gained weight and that's what happens with a lot of us know is that over time we gradually gain weight and then we look and we say well this is you know 10 15 20 pounds more than I want to be now but up here okay this this Center in the brain is doing its job of maintaining all those new cells okay you know it's going you know our job two days make sure that everybody gets fed and so we're working against something that's quite automatic in there you know the appetite that we have you know the appetite that we have when we have carb cravings you know I my sense of it is is that that's just something very very automatic Amanda but I also know that it's possible for us to especially someone with a strong conviction that you're demonstrating you know to to really start making some changes so maybe we'll explore for a moment if you like some of the things that you've tried and maybe your sense of what some of the things you you know might might like us to look into it now
3748,high_071,client,so i tried the you know looking at diets and of course any of that stuff always leads to putting on more way
3749,high_071,counsellor,yep
3750,high_071,client,I've turned changing diets I've had major life changes where I'm not working anymore thinking that I would now have all this time to exercise
3751,high_071,counsellor,and it's actually a more sedentary
3752,high_071,client,yeah especially because they have here i am the less i can move around cuz it's so painful
3753,high_071,counsellor,so kind of a vicious cycle
3754,high_071,client,oh yeah and I was having got diagnosed with severe apnea sleep apnea and learning about all that impacts and now I've been on using machine for about five weeks and I feel the difference both emotionally and physically and they say it takes three to six months to even really i could feel even better than when i'm feeling now so this is definitely the time to make this change they say the lack of sleep to sleep apnea impacts wait
3755,high_071,counsellor,I think it does
3756,high_071,client,so it's possible that was contributing to my you know to my weight gain
3757,high_071,counsellor,yeah absolutely and then even just the factor that the apnea causes you to feel very tired during the day
3758,high_071,client,oh I told them a larger gym
3759,high_071,counsellor,yeah you don't have that energy to beginning of the doing things
3760,high_071,client,oh just just the diet just so diet and I you know I five books I don't always read them with all the things to get all to try to change my mind around I've television shows about and it saved a lot of research wow I've done I've done the lazy persons research but but I you know I've been tuned into it and I've tried writing down what I ate didn't last very long
3761,high_071,counsellor,can they keep it rising on us
3762,high_071,client,no no I think once I got realized how much I was eating I stopped writing um but yeah well that's really
3763,high_071,counsellor,about it right on that i might share
3764,high_071,client,uh-huh
3765,high_071,counsellor,if you're interested a book that i read a while back called why french women don't get fat
3766,high_071,client,oh
3767,high_071,counsellor,and our goal isn't to be like french women but there are some things in in the in the diet in or lifestyle in that country that are different than the lifestyle in the united states and seem to contribute to better fitness and not quite so much overweight in the book she is a high school student exchange student going to the US and she encountered chocolate chip cookies and brownies and things could put a lot of weight on her and the amount of time look what just happened that must be must be youtube doing that I've all guys folks um and when she got back to the to France she'd gained a lot of weight went to her family doctor and he suggested that that's the first step getting that making a food log
3768,high_071,client,mm-hmm
3769,high_071,counsellor,and then the perspective that he used was was to just find what he called the offenders we'd like one or two things that oh hi you know concentrated Swedes or concentrated fat and I see a not happening here then what what comes up driver when it I
3770,high_071,client,ice cream
3771,high_071,counsellor,ice cream yep
3772,high_071,client,ice cream
3773,high_071,counsellor,yeah ice cream I think pretty much is at the top of the list for all of us you know I swear that ice cream when I have it it just goes right to my hips you know it doesn't pass go doesn't go like two hundred dollars it just goes right there so have you had you looked into that as a possibility if so i might try to cut back
3774,high_071,client,oh yeah at times i have but i struggled a little bit recently and I um I was gone through ice cream consistently over a couple we carry then guess what my week when I just get so single-minded in focus that's when I go into the grocery store that's all I go for that's all I can think about
3775,high_071,counsellor,mmm yeah I think it's really got that reward circuit in our brain down yeah yeah yeah yeah well is that something you'd like to cut back on
3776,high_071,client,Oh a little
3777,high_071,counsellor,ill so you'd like to be I love I got ice cream okay
3778,high_071,client,and let the point one I I don't forgot to say no never but I'm at the point where saying just don't need it I mean I could go for two but buying it out of the grocery store it's not working for me it's not allergies
3779,high_071,counsellor,only you're thinking not getting into the house
3780,high_071,client,yeah I keep it out of the house
3781,high_071,counsellor,haha not come thank you a very good idea you are not shutting down will not let this happen I've already been with apple support it looks like YouTube needs a talking okay so ice cream is the goal
3782,high_071,client,yeah
3783,high_071,counsellor,okay
3784,high_071,client,a leather go
3785,high_071,counsellor,all right and in what would you say your your specific goal would be about ice cream that you really like to not have it in the house is that your main thing or
3786,high_071,client,not having a now yeah that's that would be huge to having it cuz that's really where I'm breaking down is when I bite it and I gallon put it in two days you know
3787,high_071,counsellor,yeah and that's so easy to do because it's not filling you know and you know we it turns to liquid in our stomach to everybody
3788,high_071,client,I mean it for breakfast
3789,high_071,counsellor,oh sure
3790,high_071,client,yeah
3791,high_071,counsellor,oh absolutely yeah that is one of the strategies I used once I just have a little in the morning and burn it off you know and all that's doing is lighting that fire in there I don't know something ya
3792,high_071,client,got extreme hung up
3793,high_071,counsellor,okay so the goal is just not have it at home
3794,high_071,client,okay yeah
3795,high_071,counsellor,and how confident would you say you feel and again we're going to go back to as if you roll the clock 0 to 10 0 and 0 is you don't feel at all confident and 10 as you feel completely confident that you will be able to make this change if not having ice cream in the house and maybe we'll say Joanna for the time of you know an estimate of help for how long
3796,high_071,client,um
3797,high_071,counsellor,week two weeks
3798,high_071,client,let's say two weeks
3799,high_071,counsellor,yeah
3800,high_071,client,so I'm going to have to find a healthy choice to get when I get those urge for that ice cream and then instead of walking in the store going to present food I'll keep the ODI go the other way and pick up fruit
3801,high_071,counsellor,yeah it's funny when I think it's hannaford here in Calais the ice cream is over that way and the produce is over the head okay no it's like making a right turn instead of a left turn
3802,high_071,client,it's an interesting it sorry
3803,high_071,counsellor,yeah it's the right and it's the right way you go yeah young you could have a cup am i right yeah all right thank you let's take the right turn out of the right right whatever nothing yet
3804,high_071,client,um so uh do we could be the challenge to we could be a good challenge
3805,high_071,counsellor,so why would you put your confidence 0 to 10 i'll let you make a mark to feel like
3806,high_071,client,i'm gonna say a seven right now
3807,high_071,counsellor,um
3808,high_071,client,just just because i can think of go right lots of cash registers between there and the foot the frozen food so if i get out before that
3809,high_071,counsellor,um
3810,high_071,client,that would be good it would certainly if i die that was thinking about the pain and my loss of mobility can write that I hereby your ruler I can remember that if I go all the way the other way to the frozen food so I go left I'm going to have pain if I go right come on much better chance of feeling better
3811,high_071,counsellor,okay
3812,high_071,client,and
3813,high_071,counsellor,and that brings up an idea I might be able to help you with maybe next time we meet if you like
3814,high_071,client,okay
3815,high_071,counsellor,and that is of course we'll check in and see how it was not going fun also there's a process called thought mapping that's a method where you walk yourself through step by step going into the store how you're feeling anything to do with feelings about ice cream and and you can rehearse in your own mind
3816,high_071,client,uh-huh
3817,high_071,counsellor,making the right turn instead of the wrong turn
3818,high_071,client,peddling visualization like athletes do
3819,high_071,counsellor,yes exactly and part of that yeah the way that they visualize they want to do that I left then I hi pole vault oh and they by picturing themselves doing it they actively Prix the performance improves
3820,high_071,client,yeah
3821,high_071,counsellor,same story here
3822,high_071,client,okay I understood that
3823,high_071,counsellor,so we might we might plan that or it sounds like you kind of got a sense of how it works
3824,high_071,client,yeah I'm familiar with visualization I'm good at all which is I think pretty close to mind mapping so so you think about it down the painful way and then you replace that with thinking about it with a healthier
3825,high_071,counsellor,yeah yeah it's a little bit of a but if if you already it sounds like you've already got a sense of how visualization works on and you might be able to just decide say I mean what it makes sense to you even as you're young either in the car about to get it go into the store that you're visualizing yourself or maybe at home before you go out you know whatever makes sense to you you could even experiment a bit on your own
3826,high_071,client,oh yeah
3827,high_071,counsellor,it works yeah yeah and visualizing now so I'm ever visualizing the fruit you know and having kinds that you really like you know and if you like variety you know one make it as enjoyable as possible but you are so wise to come up with that idea of substituting something you know putting having something else in place of because when we just take something away something else in the brain goes 0 or you're taking my you know it didn't
3828,high_071,client,ya
3829,high_071,counsellor,I'm going to have this instead this is much better
3830,high_071,client,yeah
3831,high_071,counsellor,and I should check the time for measures when we are I get 15 minutes
3832,high_071,client,I hackathon and over here
3833,high_071,counsellor,we are on not seeing oh yes we are i think we can stop ok so i will look forward to seeing you in a couple weeks and
3834,high_071,client,yeah
3835,high_071,counsellor,wish you well
3836,high_071,client,thank you very much do we have to attract a great plan going here ok
3837,high_072,counsellor,well Jim I'm glad you're here I'm kind of surprised to see you're coming back today
3838,high_072,client,well I'll tell you one thing I sit out in front here for about an hour before I come in and that was about that that close just cranking that pickup up and heading back home I'll let you know just like I told rich I'm not real happy about being here I hope you understand that
3839,high_072,counsellor,I'm hearing you loud and clear that being here is not something that's really a high priority for you
3840,high_072,client,and like an etching you got blond hair you know I haven't had a lot of luck with blonde hair last couple of weeks
3841,high_072,counsellor,is alright well tell me a little bit more about that
3842,high_072,client,well I got assigned a probation officer and she's blond-headed gal
3843,high_072,counsellor,mm-hmm
3844,high_072,client,and I think she's out to just destroy me totally you know she's she's talking about me getting a lot of jail time this big fine and everything that she's gonna do if I don't do certain things and I just kind of think maybe you're gonna do the same thing to me
3845,high_072,counsellor,so it seems to you like I might try to push you around and make it do a whole bunch of things you don't want to do
3846,high_072,client,yeah and you know I'm I'm about up to here with this kind of stuff oh I hope you know that probably isn't your fault but I just kind of way things been going
3847,high_072,counsellor,you're pretty fed up
3848,high_072,client,yeah my daughter you know she well let me see the kids
3849,high_072,counsellor,your grandchildren what's that about
3850,high_072,client,well she'll let me see him but she won't let me take him anywhere anymore
3851,high_072,counsellor,really
3852,high_072,client,and and that really has me upset you know she's afraid that all I'll take him hurt him driving around drunk drinking and driving things like that and I never have heard one of them kids hmm
3853,high_072,counsellor,so she's afraid that if you take the children with you that you'll be drinking and then you might hurt them or
3854,high_072,client,get a name and I say that a Dowlen I one drink she still don't trust me now and that's really got me upset nearly got me ticked off
3855,high_072,counsellor,so the fact that your daughter won't even take your word for the fact that you won't drink kind of bites at you a little bit
3856,high_072,client,and she said yeah why you need help well you know when she needed help I damn sure didn't put any kind of conditional you know and and I'm gonna tell she means I need help you know she I've always built around I was helped her financial she needs kids watching anything she needs old daddy's always giving it to her and I don't know where she get my list from this is really
3857,high_072,counsellor,what does she say to you about her concerns
3858,high_072,client,well she says she's fraid dead you know I'll do something that hurt the kids
3859,high_072,counsellor,uh-huh
3860,high_072,client,but I never didn't kids and never have in my life than to thank her
3861,high_072,counsellor,kind of a mystery to you why she'd even be worried about that
3862,high_072,client,ever since my wife moved out I think she's just taking an attitude with my wife you know that she's siding with her for some reason you know up and up until my wife moved out thanks for going party get your moment we're not divorced but my wife is it's kind of upset at me also feyza she moved out a couple three months ago
3863,high_072,counsellor,do you kind of have the feeling that your wife and daughter are ganging up against you
3864,high_072,client,it feels that way I don't know if it you know if that's true but I just kind of feel like well why they called once they get you down everybody jumps on that's the way I feel now you know that the since that DWI and car wreck and everything and my wife's left from the daughters you know raising Cain with me now probation officers one that to eat my lunch put me in jail you know break me financially and things like my my boss is all but said if I if I lose my driver's license my have a job there I've got about three more years to go before retire so a lot of what what I'm doing here you know or why I'm coming here the only reason I'm coming here is so that I can maybe save my driver's license I won't lose my job so I won't lose my house it's not because I'm gonna do any of this crap
3865,high_072,counsellor,yeah you're not here because you think you have a problem you're here because they sent you here
3866,high_072,client,yeah corp sent me here
3867,high_072,counsellor,and that's the only reason you're here
3868,high_072,client,yeah I'll be honest with you there's no need me lying to you because I don't unless you go down and tell the court that you know I did you know I'm not motivated to be here or anything but I I don't like any of this I'll be honest with you no it's taken a lot of time that I don't have to take a lot of money that I don't have you know for the court and the fines and all this stuff now on top of that I've got to pay my lawyer $1
3869,high_073,counsellor,it's good to see you
3870,high_073,client,thanks it's good to be here
3871,high_073,counsellor,I want to talk to you about some of your symptoms try to figure out what's going on with you
3872,high_073,client,okay
3873,high_073,counsellor,we're talking earlier and you mentioned you had some some thinking that was thoughts that were bothering it okay tell me about those
3874,high_073,client,um well it's really weird and uncomfortable and well but I feel like I'm being monitored by the CIA and I really I don't like it and they're using my cell phone
3875,high_073,counsellor,okay the CIA's using your cell phone to track your activities
3876,high_073,client,yeah to track my activities and to find out what's going on in my brain
3877,high_073,counsellor,okay do you know why they be doing this
3878,high_073,client,well I'm I'm really not sure I think that well I'm say you're thinking about replacing me with a robot
3879,high_073,counsellor,okay
3880,high_073,client,so you know my thoughts are pretty important and you know I'm not you know
3881,high_073,counsellor,ya know it sounds very frustrating
3882,high_073,client,idiots
3883,high_073,counsellor,so I asked you and you ever ever see or hear things other people can't see or hear
3884,high_073,client,I don't think summed up
3885,high_073,counsellor,okay so like an idea how this impacts your daily life can you tell me how this these recurring thoughts about the CIA even affect how you function from a daily basis
3886,high_073,client,well yesterday I was getting the kids ready for school and trying to get ready for work and I mean normally that goes pretty smoothly but I didn't want to pick up my cell phone and put it in my bag because I was really afraid I didn't know if it's just when I put it up to my ear or when I touch it that they can affect
3887,high_073,counsellor,you know not sure how they're really tracking

3904,high_073,client,well yeah I was it's really embarrassing but I I was hearing my aunt talking to me and it was like she was talking through a loudspeaker and you know it
3905,high_073,counsellor,when you let me clarify and say you were hearing your hand talk to you was she there
3906,high_073,client,no stead

3909,high_073,counsellor,so but you could still hear her voice
3910,high_073,client,oh yeah I heard her voice yeah and but she's dead so I could have heard her voice and it sounded like it was coming through a loudspeaker and she was definitely talking to me and it was really freaking me out
3911,high_073,counsellor,you know what she was saying I didn't make out words
3912,high_073,client,um yeah she was she was talking to me about you know keeping my room leader
3913,high_073,counsellor,is that something she's to say when she was around which was a lot
3914,high_073,client,no
3915,high_073,counsellor,no
3916,high_073,client,no
3917,high_073,counsellor,you have any idea what might have brought these symptoms on
3918,high_073,client,well maybe it was the attack
3919,high_073,counsellor,she talked about that
3920,high_073,client,yeah I was coming out of the library and was downtown and I was headed to my car and it was late and the sky he just came out of nowhere and you know he's really rough language and he grabbed my pocketbook and then he took off and it was really it was really really upsetting there was a policeman nearby and you know they found the guy you know he's he's wouldn't jail but I got my pocketbook back and but it was horrible
3921,high_073,counsellor,I'm so scary
3922,high_073,client,it was really bad yeah yeah maybe that was what I mean it was it was after that that I started hearing my name
3923,high_073,counsellor,your hands voice
3924,high_073,client,yeah
3925,high_073,counsellor,about how long have you been hearing her voice
3926,high_073,client,it well it was it was it was only two days but but it was real
3927,high_073,counsellor,it was frightening Gordon
3928,high_073,client,yeah
3929,high_073,counsellor,can tell me what happened after those two days that when the voices stopped
3930,high_073,client,well I mean my husband was really supportive of me through it all and you know my my mom my kids everybody I felt like people were there for me and you know I guess I kind of knew that you know I was taken care of and and then they just sort of stopped and and things went back to normal again
3931,high_073,counsellor,okay so since you've had since the voices stopped you really haven't had any problems
3932,high_073,client,I guess not no
3933,high_073,counsellor,do you remember any occasion before this episode with the guy attacking you and then you have the voices with something like this that before
3934,high_073,client,no definitely not
3935,high_073,counsellor,the only time
3936,high_073,client,yeah
3937,high_073,counsellor,and this has been very useful I appreciate you it's good to see you Diane
3938,high_073,client,thank you good to see you
3939,high_073,counsellor,I ask you some questions out what's going on and see how you're feeling you tell me what's going on
3940,high_073,client,you don't know already
3941,high_073,counsellor,I don't know
3942,high_073,client,they didn't tell you
3943,high_073,counsellor,I got a little bit of an idea but I really don't know I need to hear from you
3944,high_073,client,um well it's still they the CIA 15 times
3945,high_073,counsellor,15 times
3946,high_073,client,18 times flowers the CIA is absolutely following me in French sometimes Latin
3947,high_073,counsellor,what what has happened that makes you believe the CIA's is following
3948,high_073,client,did you say that fifteen times it's their shadows I know they're there they might be there now
3949,high_073,counsellor,now when you say bye to him or your firm
3950,high_073,client,sake Bob the flowers and 15 times do they talk to you the CIA
3951,high_073,counsellor,you don't talk to mate
3952,high_073,client,oh okay
3953,high_073,counsellor,did you talk to you though
3954,high_073,client,they don't talk to me but they don't know I hear them too
3955,high_073,counsellor,do you think they're here right now
3956,high_073,client,clothes should not be left on the floor but the refrigerator has five bags the flowers no
3957,high_073,counsellor,so you're not sure if they're here now
3958,high_073,client,the CIA is here
3959,high_073,counsellor,they are here that's because you can hear the or you can you said earlier you could hear what they're talking about it here's something
3960,high_073,client,I'm not very comfortable discussing this if I see the shadows I know they're there they don't know that I can hear them and
3961,high_073,counsellor,you can hear them and you can see that the shadows that we've on the ground
3962,high_073,client,why wouldn't you want to know the shadows around the wall
3963,high_073,counsellor,you see the shadows
3964,high_073,client,I hear their voices in French
3965,high_073,counsellor,so an let me ask you it sounds like this is disturbing you how long has it been going on
3966,high_073,client,this time
3967,high_073,counsellor,yeah
3968,high_073,client,this time 90 years and why not forever this time I've known they're here for I think well a very long time
3969,high_073,counsellor,as long as you can remember is there ever
3970,high_073,client,always yes
3971,high_073,counsellor,is every time you didn't have this happening we see I wasn't chasing you
3972,high_073,client,maybe they're quieter at times but they've always been there
3973,high_073,counsellor,how about when you were younger was there time when you didn't feel like they were bothering in
3974,high_073,client,cereal boxes convulsive water I don't feel comfortable discussing this they were always in with me
3975,high_073,counsellor,they've always with you this information has been useful thank you
3976,high_074,counsellor,hey Marissa it's nice to see you again I'm really glad you came back I am this is about our second session and last session we kind of talked about you and some just a little bit about you and we left off about you know where what you and your friends do on the weekends and you had mentioned the alcohol so this session I thought we could talk about what you do on the weekends with your friends and you know how much alcohol you guys are using and kind of stuff like that does that sound all right yeah good so let's get started so can you tell me a little bit about what you guys do on the weekends
3977,high_074,client,we have parties the days we drink I mostly parties being thrown like dance around a big crowd other weekends just a few of us or hanging out watching movies
3978,high_074,counsellor,okay
3979,high_074,client,so it kind of depends on the activity if alcohol's involved or not yeah
3980,high_074,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about the difference a pleasure you get from the weekends you're drinking alcohol to the weekends you know I
3981,high_074,client,I mean a party is more energetic but obviously tiring after but in the moment like it's fun and you're dancing around you're drinking and having fun but then over just watching movies it's kind of more calm relaxing but sometimes kind of boring
3982,high_074,counsellor,okay so there's kind of some pros and cons to both sides of drinking and not drinking
3983,high_074,client,yeah
3984,high_074,counsellor,okay so what are some of these things that you do like about alcohol
3985,high_074,client,follow me drink we usually have more fun a little bit more loosen to relax but don't wanna drink too much obviously that can be bad
3986,high_074,counsellor,mm-hmm so it sounds like when you're drinking a little too much it's kind of turns into a bad time but you just drink you're right about the right amount or just a little bit you're have fun with your friends and you know not not getting into too bad of situations that's not about right so what are some things that you don't like about drinking
3987,high_074,client,a lot of time it just makes people like stupid make dumb decisions but we try to be as safe as possible like staying at friend's house so you don't drink and drive or are having like weird strangers come over and put things in your drink or won't have with that
3988,high_074,counsellor,okay so you're saying thank by staying at some friends houses and you know kind of watching out on trust when you're drinking alcohol and but you're you know something so I'm like they're still kind of happening and even with after kind of planning us out
3989,high_074,client,yeah sometimes
3990,high_074,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about that
3991,high_074,client,um I just felt like when when I'm me or one of my friends drinks too much and like we end up puking it's just not fun when that happens
3992,high_074,counsellor,yeah peaking definitely outside I can just can't imagine the feeling so I'm sorry you had to experience that
3993,high_074,client,yeah
3994,high_074,counsellor,can you tell me how often you have thrown up from drinking alcohol
3995,high_074,client,just once for me it was the first time I'd ever drink so I just drink way too much I didn't know what I was doing mixed in all kinds of alcohol I'm just drinking what everybody what anybody would give me and that didn't end up - well Eisley so after that I haven't really I still have friends that throw up and drink way too much and I have to take care of that take care of them so that's sometimes kind of a downer
3996,high_074,counsellor,okay so on one side some of the things with alcohol or you know it creates you to be a little relaxed and carefree and have fun to dance but on the other hand you know there's a little bit more cleaning involved to be safe about it and sometimes you know you drink a little bit too much and that can cause it down on your night for you or you know how to take care of a friend
3997,high_074,client,yeah
3998,high_074,counsellor,okay so earlier you had mentioned that a couple times that you had had to some decisions with limiting your alcohol and you know that make it as safe as possible why don't you think that you uh did that
3999,high_074,client,well I have an aunt that's an alcoholic so I see like the drinking issues and I know how bad drinking can be like I've seen movies and things and I just want to be safe and being a saint setting where I can let loose like a parents house like a friend who's cooler so I mean I'm gonna have fun but I want to limit the dangers I just want to make sure that when we're drinking and that we respect like so ever somewhere in
4000,high_074,counsellor,yeah but something you kind of get a good head on your shoulders and respect must be a big value to you
4001,high_074,client,yeah I think it's important to respect others and then get that respect in return
4002,high_074,counsellor,okay so do you think that drinking kind of fits in with that value or how does that fit in with your value of respect
4003,high_074,client,well I think drinking is kind of disrespectful to your own body because you're putting things that shouldn't be in there and I respect myself by limiting my drinking and like staying at someone's house to be safe and just limiting my actions of who I hang out with when I drink
4004,high_074,counsellor,okay so you're kind of looking at balancing you know how much you can drink with some positive benefits without crossing over to those negative sides so what have you come up with at this point do you sort of stick to a limit
4005,high_074,client,I mean I make my own drinks and I like exactly how much is in it what's in it so I can control it. Like I'll make one drink to make it last as long as possible. So if somebody comes up and it's like here I have this drink I'm are I'm like I'm gonna die already have this. And I'm still able to let loose.
4006,high_074,counsellor,okay so you pretty much it feels like it works for you and you kind of have it spelled out where you know it goes smooth so you're sort of balancing that and sometimes do you ever exceed that limit
4007,high_074,client,for the most part it works really well I still have come people people come up to me like at a party and pressure me and I'm just like no I'm good I've already had some that have my drink but sometimes people be like take a shot and then like everybody gathers in the kitchen and takes one together so sometimes like that I'll drink too much
4008,high_074,counsellor,okay so a portion of the time it's working in the other portion the time it's kind of like you just go with the flow
4009,high_074,client,mm-hmm
4010,high_074,counsellor,okay so kind of thinking on those lines how important is it is it to you to make some changes or adjustments to your drinking when you're looking at your values or maybe your future plans
4011,high_074,client,in terms of like respecting my values and body I'd like to drink less cuz it's nice to let loose enough fun but I don't want to you know like damage my body I have my friends on boards I can work with that like the peer pressure to drink more like the shots so for right now I don't really know if I can quit cuz all my friends are drinking
4012,high_074,counsellor,don't do your friends peer pressure you
4013,high_074,client,sometimes but I mean I think they'd support me if I'm trying to quit
4014,high_074,counsellor,okay so you may find it hard to stop drinking completely because they're drinking around to you but if you might find it easier if you just lessen the amount of drinking but your friends wouldn't support you either way it sounds like
4015,high_074,client,yeah and hopefully maybe they'd even slow down on their drinkin
4016,high_074,counsellor,yeah won't be no good for all of you guys to kind of do it together so you kind of have a goal to set back them out of you drink how important is it to you maybe on a scale of one to ten one being the not that pour in at all so you tend being the most important thing to you right now
4017,high_074,client,I'd say like a six or seven like I'd like to work on it if I can get around to that I don't I don't
4018,high_074,counsellor,okay so why would you pick a six or seven may be compared to a four
4019,high_074,client,I mean I think it's important and like I know it can affect my body and wanting to be a doctor in it health is going to be really important to me and it can affect my social life and schoolwork
4020,high_074,counsellor,okay so you're just kind of making those changes when you feel like it's gonna fit into your life
4021,high_074,client,mm-hmm
4022,high_074,counsellor,okay so looking ahead you kind of think that drinking wouldn't really help you with those goals
4023,high_074,client,yeah
4024,high_074,counsellor,okay so how confident are you that you can make these changes on a scale of one to ten one being not confident at all and ten being the most confident you've ever felt
4025,high_074,client,yeah I mean if I had decided that I was going to do it for sure that they attend
4026,high_074,counsellor,Wow so 10 is pretty pretty big so why do you think you picked a 10
4027,high_074,client,because I mean I know I can do it it's just making the decision to do it
4028,high_074,counsellor,okay so maybe you had mentioned you'd like to cut down but you have to have the right timing and it's got to be you know 100 percent you're doing it
4029,high_074,client,yeah
4030,high_074,counsellor,okay so what else do you think you could do with that how could you you know cut down on your drinking
4031,high_074,client,I was thinking about talking to my friends no I don't want to sound dorky but like let's stay in tonight and not go out or just be like I'm not gonna drink tonight but and then I want them to be like okay with that like okay with me not drinking
4032,high_074,counsellor,okay so sort of you know playing activities that might not include alcohol as much and kind of getting your friends on board with being okay with doing this alcohol or those activities without alcohol okay so do you feel like this is a goal that you could maybe set and be willing to work on
4033,high_074,client,I think so
4034,high_074,counsellor,okay well would it be okay if we met for the next couple weeks and kind of worked on this goal together
4035,high_074,client,yeah I think WR
4036,high_074,counsellor,okay well your commitment to changing you know kind of this behavior and you know making a commitment to chat really shows that you're going on to the next step and you know making a change for you know maybe the better for your life if that's what you know it's for you so does that sound like that's kind of right
4037,high_074,client,mm-hmm
4038,high_074,counsellor,okay so I'm just gonna do a little summary it sounds like you're kind of studying big goals for yourself like becoming a doctor and graduating high school and go to college and I'm really looking forward to you know see how you do and I think you'll do great and looking forward to school and it sounds like you have a pretty good social life and you know you're pretty active in sports from what I heard earlier for my last session and that all these benefits can help you you know maybe from cutting back on alcohol with maybe you know bettering your school performance and really helping your health and you know possibly you know helping you find belonging with your friends without having to have alcohol and also it's really exciting to have a really good plan in place as long as you're willing you know I would really like to be real working with you
4039,high_074,client,okay
4040,high_074,counsellor,all right well I'll see you next week all right well Dana I want to welcome you back into my office I appreciate your willingness to come back this week it was really a pleasure to get to know you a little bit last week and I really do appreciate your willingness to be so vulnerable with me I know it's not easy to just spill your guts with a stranger so I really appreciate that is there anything that I can do right now to make you a little more comfortable okay well as you know you're more than welcome to use the restroom if you need to while we're having our conversation so if you do it's just right around the corner I also want to briefly remind you of our confidentiality rules and I told you last week that I always just like to reiterate that everything you say in this room will be completely confidential the only reason that I would have to break that as of course if you were to tell me that you have an intent to harm yourself or anyone else so last week you talked a little bit about what brought you into the office excuse me and why you're seeking treatment with your use of marijuana um I heard you say that you're having increased difficulties with your asthma as a result of your smoking yes is that about right
4041,high_074,client,yeah
4042,high_074,counsellor,okay well you're a primary care physician thought it might be helpful for you to come talk to me a little bit about your asthma and your use of marijuana because he's I think he's worried about your use of marijuana with your condition which you agreed to come speak with me so am I on track here so far
4043,high_074,client,yeah
4044,high_074,counsellor,okay all right well perfect well since we discussed a little bit about your history last week I want to begin this week by discussing the cravings that you experience and maybe what we can do to help cope with some of those cravings in other words maybe develop some alternatives to smoking do have these cravings how does that sound
4045,high_074,client,sounds all right I mean I'm not really sure how I'm gonna be able to do that but like what exactly do you mean
4046,high_074,counsellor,okay well let's just start a little bit by talking about your cravings the cravings themselves when you wake up in the morning you start your day when does a typical craving start for you
4047,high_074,client,about the second or you that wake up
4048,high_074,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about what that's like for you
4049,high_074,client,so it kind of makes me feel real calm and relaxed when I smoke and it kind of keeps me relaxed throughout the day so I continue to smoke you know to keep that high and you know just helps me not stressed about work
4050,high_074,counsellor,okay so the types of planning that we typically do to help these cravings include components of reminding ourselves of maybe the negative consequences that come along with these behaviors so another component would be to find alternatives to this solution so when you wake up and think who I know I'll be more calm throughout the day I'll be more relaxed at work maybe could we try to remind ourselves of the negative consequence that we discussed last week like I'll be more likely to be late to work if I sweat this morning these are just some examples of some ways that we can help remind ourselves throughout the day to maybe combat these cravings but I know maybe that's easier said than done like I'll wake up and just tell myself that it won't be beneficial you know sometimes that's easier said than done so another thing that we can do is find very specific alternatives to the smoking so we could look at other activities that may provide this relaxation and calming feeling that you're describing would you have any ideas about I know we talked a little bit last week and you're going to think about maybe some alternatives were you able to come up with thing
4051,high_074,client,I just don't really know how alternatives are gonna help me avoid smoking
4052,high_074,counsellor,okay so I hear you say that you don't see how discussing alternatives will help you stop smoking
4053,high_074,client,exactly I mean I'm enjoy doing things but not as much as I'd enjoy when I smoke
4054,high_074,counsellor,okay so nothing else that you can do will relax you as much as marijuana does
4055,high_074,client,yeah I mean there may be some things but there's nothing like that right now that I do that relaxes me as much as marijuana does
4056,high_074,counsellor,okay so what would it be like for you if we were maybe to just explore some new activities or new techniques that could provide you some relaxation
4057,high_074,client,I'm really not good to change or trying new things
4058,high_074,counsellor,okay well that's understandable change is hard and it's hard for a lot of people if trying something completely new would be too difficult maybe we could find something that you've tried in the past or liked in the past I don't want us to choose anything that would be uncomfortable for you so let me ask maybe what kinds of activities have you done before that brought you the sense of being relaxed and peace
4059,high_074,client,well I used to be a big runner but I stopped running about maybe eight years that'll go
4060,high_074,counsellor,okay I know you mentioned last week that you started smoking about a year ago would it be fair to assume that you stopped running around the same time you started smoking?
4061,high_074,client,yeah I'd be fair to assume that I guess
4062,high_074,counsellor,okay so you said that you were a big runner what role did running play in your life
4063,high_074,client,I just kind of helped me wind down after a long day of work. I'd go on a run after work and it kind of helped me to decompress.
4064,high_074,counsellor,okay so it sounds like running really helped to bring a sense of relaxation to you
4065,high_074,client,yeah I really did it kind of calmed my nerves and made me feel better about you know just about everything
4066,high_074,counsellor,okay so what let me ask you what would it be like if we were to bring running into your life again
4067,high_074,client,I guess I haven't really considered that option
4068,high_074,counsellor,okay well I want you to take a second and imagine what it would be like for you to running what would that look like if you were to imagine that
4069,high_074,client,honestly I'd probably be much more relaxed after work and I wouldn't be able to smoke right after you know something worked like or something I've done you know that has stressed me out
4070,high_074,counsellor,okay so Dana I'm hearing you say that running brings you a really great sense of calmness would this be something we could set as maybe homework for next time like in between our next session now in our next session for you to try running again to replace the calmness smoking brings to you
4071,high_074,client,I think so it might take me a hot second to get started up on you know running a long distance
4072,high_074,counsellor,okay well I appreciate your willingness to consider it I know you said it's a bit awhile and it takes some courage it really does to get back into something that you haven't done and as maybe has gotten a little unfamiliar so I appreciate that
4073,high_074,client,yeah I mean it'll be hard at first but my doctor has actually been telling me that running would really help me with my asthma you know
4074,high_074,counsellor,okay well perfect that sounds like that's really would be a good fit to improve your asthma which is what brought you here in the first place and then maybe help you cut down on the smoking does it sound about right to you
4075,high_074,client,yeah I mean that sounds about right it's kind of it's on all pages for everything
4076,high_074,counsellor,okay awesome I'm wondering if you'd be willing to do something else for me so we're gonna try the running and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to journal maybe after a run so say if you chose to run three days after work next week just jot down a couple things like what it was like to start running again or if you were to think about any of the cravings or just your treatment in general just what it was like to go running again for you Kasana you mentioned last session that you really used to love journaling and reading and so that's why I bring it up because I know you used to enjoy your journaling
4077,high_074,client,okay yeah I mean I actually probably like that because I did journal a lot about you know just random things and that was just about and stuff so it'd be nice to maybe get back into that
4078,high_074,counsellor,okay and journaling helped you
4079,high_074,client,it it kind of did it was I mean it helped me like sort out my stresses
4080,high_074,counsellor,okay okay well it sounds like we have a solid plan in place how are you feeling right now about our plan and today
4081,high_074,client,I feel really good about it I know I've been wanting to get back into both running and you know journaling and this will help me kind of with my stress but you know and it's kind of a big opportunity to start making changes and you know I want to get better because my Aspen it's really kicking my butt and I want to start exercising more maybe stop smoking

4179,high_075,counsellor,not really
4180,high_075,client,okay the dreams may change in your dreams and them distressing to ever feel like you're reliving the moment when the trauma occurred had other similar events brought out a strong reaction from you like other other stories of fires is that because that may have you had any cause of effect and a sense of fear or anxiety or terror say I'm gonna keep moving forward through some of these the questions I have to ask you in regard to this event do you find yourself avoiding making efforts to avoid memories thoughts or feelings so you associated with this event
4181,high_075,counsellor,"I have a lot of thoughts about it, a lot of memories about it. I think I've just kind of got to work through them, you know. We had this really sad but I can't let it roll my life. You said it."
4182,high_075,client,you're more confronting them than avoiding them it sounds like
4183,high_075,counsellor,I guess uh yeah
4184,high_075,client,okay how about right making any effort to avoid things that might remind you of the event like people places situations activities anything like that
4185,high_075,counsellor,not really I Drive by the fire I have fire house on my way to work most mornings like I see it and I think about that day but you know Who am I gonna do try six months out of my way you know I don't think so yeah
4186,high_075,client,you're not really you know they try to avoid any reminders at this time so I have some other questions now about emotional state I appreciate your patience and with these questions they're kind of mostly related to your mood and much I to understand how your voice but since the dramatic event do you find yourself any trouble remembering anything about the traumatic event have you noticed since the event that you have any kind of exaggerated negative beliefs about the world or yourself other people okay how about distorted thinking surrounding what would caused the event
4187,high_075,counsellor,no it was pretty straightforward

4196,high_075,client,that's right sad sama I'm gonna continue to ask some questions here I appreciate your patience to this these questions have to do with feelings symptoms that started or got worse after the trouble
4197,high_075,counsellor,okay

4209,high_075,counsellor,we've talked about a lot of different symptoms that you have due to this traumatic event or maybe they became worse because of what's happened so I'm like an idea of how much distress this has caused you in terms of social occupation or other important areas of your functioning can you describe that to me
4210,high_075,client,it's sad but you know she's safe she was safe that's the bottom line right so I mean I was I was sad about it that sound you know life goes on like this boy

4215,high_076,counsellor,my name is Jessamine all knobbly I will be leading you through our nutrition and education and counselling meeting today
4216,high_076,client,okay
4217,high_076,counsellor,just a little bit about myself I am a Nutrition and Dietetics student at Loma Linda University and we'll be sitting for my Rd exam next June
4218,high_076,client,fantastic
4219,high_076,counsellor,so I just want tell you I got into this field because I just really wanted to enhance and improve people's health through making advantageous dietary choices so
4220,high_076,client,that's great
4221,high_076,counsellor,before we get started would you like a bottle of water
4222,high_076,client,I'd love to have a bunch of water
4223,high_076,counsellor,okay
4224,high_076,client,thank you very much sure yeah can I start drinking now
4225,high_076,counsellor,yes go for it so in today's session I would just like to hear about some of your personal goals why you came to the session today obstacles you may be facing in regards to nutrition and just figure out some ways to overcome challenges that you may be facing
4226,high_076,client,okay well number one I'm really really happy to have this opportunity to sit down with you and discuss my really horrible eating habits especially by you know recently I have been actually struggling with wanting to lose the weight I would say for about a good six seven months now and all that I have seen so far is that I've been basically actually basically fluctuating between 199 and 206 sometimes even 208 the struggle today has been the frustration level of when I get on this okay I'm going to get on this quote-unquote diet and I'm going to lose the weight something amazing happens I actually end up painting I'm tired in the morning I'm stressed because we started this whole new business that we have here and I'm totally out of control I feel that I'm totally out of control when it comes to eating I think a lot of it has to do with not eating quote/unquote properly or systematically
4227,high_076,counsellor,okay so for you I just threw a lot at me so I'd like to go back and recap some of the things that you were saying to make sure that I'm understanding everything clearly
4228,high_076,client,okay
4229,high_076,counsellor,so in January 2010 you started a meal plan that was very strict and you were able to maintain it for a few years
4230,high_076,client,no few months
4231,high_076,counsellor,few months yes you think a few months and then you started to travel and you know kind of things kind of went a little bit astray from there
4232,high_076,client,yes
4233,high_076,counsellor,you went from this strict dieting all-or-nothing kind of plan do not really knowing how to make food for yourself or compose a meal for yourself because you were
4234,high_076,client,let me was you know it's interesting you say that because that meal plan that I was on that diet plan yeah what's called a no decision
4235,high_076,counsellor,yes it's a
4236,high_076,client,no decision diet which means you don't have to make any decisions about anything this is the prescription and you live with that prescription you'd be alright anyone else I kind of denied it
4237,high_076,counsellor,so you almost kind of missed out on the education portion of how to eat when you're on your own
4238,high_076,client,yes
4239,high_076,counsellor,which is what in the long term we want to achieve is for you to be able to make healthy food choices when someone isn't there to tell you what to do you're able to critically think for yourself and regardless the nutrition
4240,high_076,client,yeah
4241,high_076,counsellor,so some other things that you mentioned was that you're just feeling frustrated and kind of out of control in regards to your weight-loss initiatives which I can which is very it seems very frustrating if you want to be losing weight and you're not not seeing it and then you said that you were tend to be eating more so those are all very frustrating things and not and then you also said that during your day you're not really eating consistently
4242,high_076,client,at all
4243,high_076,counsellor,you're kind of all over the place and kind of looking for more of you know consistent meal plan day in which you're not you know starving and then overeating later
4244,high_076,client,I do the kind of like keeping it's like I wish I had one person walking behind me this fear you whatever that says okay mealtime here it is it was like preparing it here it is you know so that because I just eat such a stressful and such a work living environment
4245,high_076,counsellor,let's talk about where you get most of your meals from
4246,high_076,client,I would literally stop at the supermarket or I would stop at a 7-eleven or I would stop at a couple of times. I didn't know a lot of times I stopped at Dunkin Donuts right that pick up the donuts or at the other daughter shop. I would pick up because it's fast. A lot of times I'm eating out and it's not you know the best thing in the world.
4247,high_076,counsellor,okay um so I'm hearing that you get most of your meals from outside of the home
4248,high_076,client,yes
4249,high_076,counsellor,and not typically cooking meals and kind of go for those more convenience convenience meals that's easy yes so how would you feel about going over some tips for when you're dining out that if that's if you're very busy and like that's the option that you're doing right now I'm just making some little tweaks because cooking at home may not be an option for you at this moment
4250,high_076,client,that's very true probably I would say yes
4251,high_076,counsellor,so making little changes
4252,high_076,client,yes in regards to the restaurant is the way everything changes
4253,high_076,counsellor,yes are some some tips that you can implement when you're at the restaurant
4254,high_076,client,okay
4255,high_076,counsellor,so some of the things that I would like to talk about so when you're ordering food from a restaurant you want to stay away from words such as like fried or just like also deep fried and kind of go for those words like royal bake and steam
4256,high_076,client,okay
4257,high_076,counsellor,so recently you told me that you went to a restaurant and I have the menu printed out here and I would give you a copy of that
4258,high_076,client,yes
4259,high_076,counsellor,and and you told me that you ordered the New York strip steak
4260,high_076,client,yes
4261,high_076,counsellor,and you had bread and butter for your meal
4262,high_076,client,yes I do
4263,high_076,counsellor,so just looking at the options here we do have a fresh fish option at the top
4264,high_076,client,yes
4265,high_076,counsellor,and it says it's simply grilled with olive oil or you could get it pan-seared baked or blackened with lemon shallot butter
4266,high_076,client,mm-hm
4267,high_076,counsellor,so I would probably say maybe to stay away from the lemon shallot butter noise and maybe steer towards that simply grilled with olive oil or the maybe the baked or
4268,high_076,client,a boy in this use
4269,high_076,counsellor,you could do the pan serve but the other ones are better option
4270,high_076,client,okay
4271,high_076,counsellor,so that's um -
4272,high_076,client,I would have enjoyed the tilapia for exam
4273,high_076,counsellor,okay so
4274,high_076,client,that's what I like to eat that they were Chilean sea bass I would have enjoyed that too
4275,high_076,counsellor,so that's an opportunity that you would be
4276,high_076,client,yeah
4277,high_076,counsellor,you enjoy billing to go change
4278,high_076,client,yeah
4279,high_076,counsellor,so going for those terms and maybe doing like maybe a fish option every once in a while as opposed to doing a steak
4280,high_076,client,yes
4281,high_076,counsellor,okay some other tips so when you're ordering if you want to order a salad instead of ordering the salad and getting kind of like a Caesar dressing or something like that they typically kind of put a lot of dressing on salads so maybe ordering it on the side is a better option because then you can be in control of how much you would like to add on to the salad
4282,high_076,client,okay
4283,high_076,counsellor,and typically going for maybe like a balsamic dressing is good or you could do a balsamic and olive oil dressing
4284,high_076,client,mm-hmm
4285,high_076,counsellor,typically most restaurants will have that option
4286,high_076,client,yes and I like both stomach vinaigrette
4287,high_076,counsellor,so also in regards to restaurants portion sizes are typically very large and you had mentioned earlier that you know sometimes you just don't know when to stop eating or you tip you think you're hungrier than you are you just eat a lot at once
4288,high_076,client,yes
4289,high_076,counsellor,when you give that example with the bread
4290,high_076,client,yes
4291,high_076,counsellor,so a good tip is to kind of ask for a to-go box in the beginning when you get to the restaurant
4292,high_076,client,mm-hmm
4293,high_076,counsellor,after your meal comes and just put half of the food in the box and you don't open the box can't get home it's kind of bang for your buck too right because then you can either other real later
4294,high_076,client,yes
4295,high_076,counsellor,and you could if you do choose a healthy option you can take it to work the next day and you'll have a lunch option for you here at the office
4296,high_076,client,yes
4297,high_076,counsellor,um also when it comes to salads you really don't so here they have the chopped spinach salad for example there's bacon egg radishes mushrooms and warm bacon dressing just because a menu item has all these things included does not mean that you have to get it with all those things in it
4298,high_076,client,okay
4299,high_076,counsellor,so you can easily tell them oh can I have the chopped chicken it's chopped spinner salad without the bacon
4300,high_076,client,right I don't like bacon
4301,high_076,counsellor,so that is something that you could ask for for that side because I mean spinach is great mushrooms are great radishes are great egg is great you can always take out egg whites I mean the egg yolk if you don't want the egg yolk or anything like that so a lot of restaurants I think analogies are accommodating because they want to have your certainty they want to have your business
4302,high_076,client,yes
4303,high_076,counsellor,so they're gonna try their best to make the customer happy
4304,high_076,client,yes
4305,high_076,counsellor,so for me personally I often ask for changes in my in my orders unless they specifically specified please do not make changes on to the order or we can't make a change for this order I typically change majority of my orders
4306,high_076,client,hmm
4307,high_076,counsellor,because the foods that you eat or the foods that are commercially made are not necessarily the healthiest
4308,high_076,client,yes
4309,high_076,counsellor,they're made to appease the palate
4310,high_076,client,right
4311,high_076,counsellor,so they usually have lots of fat and you know sugar and sodium and those kinds of things added to it to appeal to a wider variety of individuals
4312,high_076,client,mm-hmm
4313,high_076,counsellor,I have a little handout here so we can talk about some like portion sizes
4314,high_076,client,okay
4315,high_076,counsellor,so a fist would be considered like a cup of rice or pasta or fruits or vegetables it's about the size of your fist is one serving
4316,high_076,client,now that's cooked rice oh
4317,high_076,counsellor,yes good right the palm of your hand is about three ounces so that would be for fish meat or poultry that's about the size some people say like a deck of cards it's about 4 ounces
4318,high_076,client,hmm
4319,high_076,counsellor,it's around there and then if you're gonna have nuts of reasons a handful is about 1 ounce there's like a little handful so one thumb would be one ounce of hard cheese or peanut butter and you said
4320,high_076,client,Wow I love cheese you know
4321,high_076,counsellor,and then for your thumb is a a teaspoon of our thumb tip is a tea spoon of cooking oil or margarine or butter and sugar
4322,high_076,client,teaspoon
4323,high_076,counsellor,as a teaspoon why don't you try and start setting some goals for you in regards to some food we do
4324,high_076,client,okay
4325,high_076,counsellor,of what would work
4326,high_076,client,that seem so you go one
4327,high_076,counsellor,so what is what is one goal
4328,high_076,client,that you want you would like to accomplish for what's the eating out that I want to accomplish for eating out
4329,high_076,counsellor,yeah so would you um what a goal be that you want to choose grilled options
4330,high_076,client,well I see
4331,high_076,counsellor,what you mean okay are you willing to do that choose grilled options
4332,high_076,client,you know it's sometimes that would be a goal
4333,high_076,counsellor,so how do you feel about journaling
4334,high_076,client,hate was difficult to do but it was very exciting
4335,high_076,counsellor,mm-hmm
4336,high_076,client,because it is making me it helps me actually meet that objective
4337,high_076,counsellor,okay so that seems like something that we could
4338,high_076,client,yeah I usually get up with you already six o'clock in the morning
4339,high_076,counsellor,would you have time to journal that
4340,high_076,client,yeah I can make the time for that
4341,high_076,counsellor,okay so um how many of these a week would you say you could draw
4342,high_076,client,I can technically journal every day
4343,high_076,counsellor,okay so why don't you give a range of times so why don't we say four to seven times a week in the mornings for we can say until our next session so we can go you can go back and recap how the journaling is going for you
4344,high_076,client,what am i generally I'm gonna do it in the morning
4345,high_076,counsellor,generally how you're feeling physically maybe the food reflect on the food choices that you had made the day before maybe set some you said you like setting little objectives maybe little mini goals for yourself for the day things like that
4346,high_076,client,that is easy for me to choose actually
4347,high_076,counsellor,okay that's great so why don't we just make sure we're doing that let's say seventy-five percent of the time you're eating out
4348,high_076,client,okay that is really very doable for me
4349,high_076,counsellor,okay
4350,high_076,client,because I do it every lunchtime when I go that's exactly
4351,high_076,counsellor,what I do we try and good ideas living by kind of like an 8020 percent rule so eighty percent of the time you're making healthy choices twenty percent of the time you can kind of you know feel like you're not as restricted because it seemed like in the past being on a very strict diet doesn't work in the long run because that's not how life works
4352,high_076,client,yeah
4353,high_076,counsellor,and things are thrown at you and you have to be a little bit valuable to your different situation
4354,high_076,client,yes
4355,high_076,counsellor,so those are some good goals now I would like to talk a little bit maybe up some physical activity
4356,high_076,client,yes so I would love to be accused might cost me too much money
4357,high_076,counsellor,yes so I'm understand that you do want to become more physically active and you've had experience in the past being physically active what do you feel has prevented you from from being physically active is it time is it being tired
4358,high_076,client,it's actually both time being tired
4359,high_076,counsellor,okay you know what kinds of physical activity do you enjoy doing if you were to do physical activity what do you like doing
4360,high_076,client,I would I'm looking
4361,high_076,counsellor,biking swimming activities
4362,high_076,client,I love swimming
4363,high_076,counsellor,okay
4364,high_076,client,I would I don't mind actually gonna get a treadmill on the place I don't I do enjoy those things because they do we find me when I do it I don't just like I'm tired
4365,high_076,counsellor,you start that's difficult he's very different getting there
4366,high_076,client,yes yes
4367,high_076,counsellor,okay so um okay so starting is difficult but just remember that any little changes you're making are are good even if it's going to the gym for just a little bit in 20 or 15 20 minutes or just walking outside of your house and you know after work or in the morning around the lunch break just going outside getting some fresh air how do you feel about maybe parking further
4368,high_076,client,I do that
4369,high_076,counsellor,okay
4370,high_076,client,you know it's interesting but I don't do it all the time
4371,high_076,counsellor,so maybe we'd like to set a goal for that so what about well what what seems good for you how often do you want to do it every time
4372,high_076,client,what
4373,high_076,counsellor,would you like to park far
4374,high_076,client,actually get all the time for a while I did and then I stopped I'm gonna park like the closest I can
4375,high_076,counsellor,so even that alone will give you a little bit more
4376,high_076,client,that's physical activity
4377,high_076,counsellor,exercise so maybe parking I don't know an exact distance but parking further away if you're going to the grocery store if you're going in and out of places just walking more in general
4378,high_076,client,yes but I get the idea though
4379,high_076,counsellor,typically once you start something you kind of like and start seeing results
4380,high_076,client,yes
4381,high_076,counsellor,so that's where your motivation
4382,high_076,client,yes yes
4383,high_076,counsellor,so your motivation lies and seeing results
4384,high_076,client,yes yes
4385,high_076,counsellor,okay so then something to remember is that results don't come overnight and that's hard
4386,high_076,client,yes
4387,high_076,counsellor,to have to stick to something and constantly remembering that and maybe that's something you could write about in your journaling too I'm saying that results literally writing results don't happen overnight
4388,high_076,client,mm-hmm
4389,high_076,counsellor,because if you do stick to a plan over time you will see results yes we exciting for you
4390,high_076,client,yes
4391,high_076,counsellor,I'm the greatest so maybe getting up in the morning and going on the treadmill. How often would you be willing to do that? Sure we...
4392,high_076,client,you know
4393,high_076,counsellor,it's realistic a week realistically
4394,high_076,client,I mean I would love to do is float accent
4395,high_076,counsellor,four times a week so for how long do you think you can even go on
4396,high_076,client,I always wanted to be on the treadmill for about 60 minutes
4397,high_076,counsellor,60
4398,high_076,client,yeah it feels good when I'm on threatening for 60 minutes
4399,high_076,counsellor,do you think that would be realistic for your schedule and now that we're saying that we're gonna be journal
4400,high_076,client,you start out you mean you know
4401,high_076,counsellor,okay so why don't we start trying with 20 minutes
4402,high_076,client,okay
4403,high_076,counsellor,so for 15 or 10 minutes or 50 Matt what works best for your schedule
4404,high_076,client,well
4405,high_076,counsellor,what is realistic
4406,high_076,client,"I have to tell you that I have tried the 10 and 15 minutes and it doesn't do much at all. It doesn't feel like I have done much, you know what I mean."
4407,high_076,counsellor,over time
4408,high_076,client,I guess it depends on how I'm using the treadmill
4409,high_076,counsellor,mm-hmm and over time it will help but you also have to couple it with your with I don't is
4410,high_076,client,I put down 20 minutes
4411,high_076,counsellor,20 minutes
4412,high_076,client,doctor for 20 minutes or day for four days a week
4413,high_076,counsellor,mm-hmm
4414,high_076,client,excuse me on the treadmill and I can start without doing the incline or anything just to get myself back into doing it
4415,high_076,counsellor,okay
4416,high_076,client,getting used to it
4417,high_076,counsellor,yeah it's going through the motions so yeah well it becomes kind of second nature
4418,high_076,client,right right
4419,high_076,counsellor,they say it takes about like 27 or 30 somewhere around their days to develop a habit
4420,high_076,client,I really that's interesting point
4421,high_076,counsellor,I'll have to get you the exact number later but yeah so for it to start feeling second nature so it seems like you are really you want to make you're you're preparing to make the changes right so
4422,high_076,client,yes
4423,high_076,counsellor,you know you know that you want to make the changes and you feel ready to make you feel ready to make these changes
4424,high_076,client,I actually do yes I mean I'm was really really happy when you approached me to have this this meeting I really was and that's why I was sharing with you the details
4425,high_076,counsellor,mhm
4426,high_076,client,it's almost like going to confession and because because I don't feel good about where I am I really don't
4427,high_076,counsellor,maybe one last thing I can mention right now
4428,high_076,client,um
4429,high_076,counsellor,his water
4430,high_076,client,is why it's I like water and I it's easy for me to drink water is because my throat got used to actually taking in that much water it's not a five-piece to be a fight than to begin
4431,high_076,counsellor,yeah
4432,high_076,client,you know
4433,high_076,counsellor,that's like me to drinking water for me is a struggle and I have to make myself do it but I know that I'll feel rejuvenated and I'll my body will function better and let my metabolic processes happen like they should and get my food and digestive system going so they're very I mean we're made up of mostly water so your thought you brought he needs that
4434,high_076,client,yes
4435,high_076,counsellor,and just keeps you more alert when you're dehydrated do typically more sluggish and you're less more likely to make poor nutrition decisions
4436,high_076,client,yes yeah
4437,high_076,counsellor,so just drinking water so why don't we you said you've done it in the past right how do you feel about drinking five bottles
4438,high_076,client,I honestly would not mind at all especially if I started exercising I think
4439,high_076,counsellor,so you know it's really cool as they have apps now
4440,high_076,client,though
4441,high_076,counsellor,that you can track how much water you're drinking I'll have to drop
4442,high_076,client,and you give them out to anyone that for you
4443,high_076,counsellor,mmm-hmm yeah and you can track how much water you're drinking out of there and there's other web sites or apps like MyFitnessPal that you can track what you're eating and it will track all the calories and things like that for your day so why don't we go over um why don't we recap some of the goals so I just wanted me to say your understanding you know what we went through and some things that we talked about
4444,high_076,client,okay let me tell you what they are
4445,high_076,counsellor,yes please
4446,high_076,client,okay so the first thing he said is how about if I did some journaling and he said to do it between four and seven times per week in the morning and then I should actually indicate also in my journaling how I feel also he said to reflect on the food choices that I made for the day the day before and that should be part of my journaling
4447,high_076,counsellor,yes you should be noting some goals for the rest of the day so I want to drink five remember to drink five bottles of water
4448,high_076,client,and I last part of my journal
4449,high_076,counsellor,things like that just was kind of like reminders for yourself
4450,high_076,client,okay the second thing there were five things all together the second thing was we talked about restaurants because I eat a lot
4451,high_076,counsellor,mm-hmm
4452,high_076,client,and he said that I really should choose always put in my mind that I should be choosing Royal Baker steamed 70% of the time but if I go with the 8020 rule it would be good I can do 82% of the time I should be doing good choice since 20% of time it can't be bad choices that's okay because many minutes so that's basically what I remember you say
4453,high_076,counsellor,well I also want to reiterate that it's you know there's no good food and bad food right there's no such thing as good food bad food that's when we we come to pick like portion sizes right
4454,high_076,client,Oh
4455,high_076,counsellor,so food is food
4456,high_076,client,yes
4457,high_076,counsellor,but we want to have more you know plant-based foods and we meats and low-fat dairy and whole grains and things like that
4458,high_076,client,um
4459,high_076,counsellor,and fruits and things because of all the health benefits that they have
4460,high_076,client,yeah
4461,high_076,counsellor,and then we want to you know for sweets and other other treats and desserts we want to keep them as treats and desserts and by doing by keeping a portion the size small we can also you know continue our goal of weight loss
4462,high_076,client,okay
4463,high_076,counsellor,because we don't want to you know deprive you and then all of a sudden oh I want to binge eat all this food
4464,high_076,client,right
4465,high_076,counsellor,so and you know there's you know events and parties and things like that that you kind of need to be you know okay with you know living a little bit
4466,high_076,client,yes
4467,high_076,counsellor,so that's it
4468,high_076,client,okay that's very good points and I noted those things the third thing is the physical activity he said that I should really begin if I do like and enjoy using the treadmill for example I ought to consider maybe 20 minutes to start every 29 to 30 days chances are you will develop a habit
4469,high_076,counsellor,I don't remember the exact timeframe but it's somewhere around there
4470,high_076,client,okay
4471,high_076,counsellor,maybe keep it as a goal just to get there just to get to that
4472,high_076,client,oh yes yes
4473,high_076,counsellor,mm-hmm
4474,high_076,client,even if you go into the office
4475,high_076,counsellor,yeah
4476,high_076,client,so that's very logic number five the fifth thing you talked about is which was more of an educational piece and you said it was all about calories and you said that what I should be considering is taking in about what would be 500 less calories per day and if I did that it would equate a loss of one pound per week
4477,high_076,counsellor,yes
4478,high_076,client,and and don't forget to increase your water intake by basically take the five bottles that I basic I was saying that I used to do so start drinking more water and drink water is because carbohydrates attached themselves to water and it is a good idea to reduce carbohydrates carbohydrates are important for the body but at the same time a lower intake of the carbohydrates would probably be helpful in weight loss
4479,high_076,counsellor,well it will have to be helpful with water I mean it will result in water weight loss but that's not really fat loss so that removes water weight will come back when you drink a bunch of water again so that's not really the weight loss we're looking for we want fat loss
4480,high_076,client,okay
4481,high_076,counsellor,you want a decrease in fat and increase in lean mass
4482,high_076,client,so I mean how are you gonna lose the fat the yeah the fat loss
4483,high_076,counsellor,through your diet and just exercising well and
4484,high_076,client,better choices you write coochie which is basically I always think Roy big steam right
4485,high_076,counsellor,yes because three 3
4486,high_077,client,I'm just tired
4487,high_077,counsellor,just tired yeah you know we did some pre-visit planning with you and your phq- which is a short depression screen was actually positive so we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool which is a phq- and that actually did come up with a score of which is in the mild depression range so how does that how does that feel
4488,high_077,client,well I knew I felt different I didn't know I was depressed
4489,high_077,counsellor,but you knew something was something was wrong
4490,high_077,client,I didn't feel like myself or have it and feeling like myself no
4491,high_077,counsellor,tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself
4492,high_077,client,when I just go to work and I come home and I sleep I wake up in the morning and I'm still tired I just have no energy
4493,high_077,counsellor,so you sleep a lot but even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested no not at all doesn't sound like good quality sleep
4494,high_077,client,no I just have no energy I don't want to do anything but just sleep
4495,high_077,counsellor,how long has
4496,high_077,client,that been going on hmm I guess a couple months or months yeah
4497,high_077,counsellor,what else is going on
4498,high_077,client,w-well you know I been drinking more I'm a drink socially but I find myself that when I come home you know I have a glass of wine and then I just go to sleep
4499,high_077,counsellor,and that's worrisome to you
4500,high_077,client,it is cuz I don't usually drink that often during the week so it's increased yeah yeah
4501,high_077,counsellor,I can see where that would be bothersome to you what else what else is going on with
4502,high_077,client,you well you know my mom died a year ago so Mother's Day is coming up so you never think about mom a lot I miss her a lot
4503,high_077,counsellor,that anniversary is is close
4504,high_077,client,yeah
4505,high_077,counsellor,that's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents that's a that's a very difficult time
4506,high_077,client,yeah and I took care of mom so that's hard because for a long time well she was sick and she died from cancer so I took care of her so for a long time that's all I did was take care of mom and work that was so now that she's gone it just kind of brings up everything all over again
4507,high_077,counsellor,it's kind of a hole in your life
4508,high_077,client,yeah we were really close
4509,high_077,counsellor,"I'm really sorry for your loss and thank you for sharing that with me. I know that's I know that's very difficult. So it sounds like your sleep has really been affected. You're not getting good quality sleep. You're really fatigued. Yeah, I'm just kind of going through the motions it sounds like during the day. And then how's your appetite been?"
4510,high_077,client,I'm not really eating that much you know so I have energy you know before I would come home cook dinner or you know meet some friends after work but I don't want to do that I just come home and have a glass of wine just go to bed
4511,high_077,counsellor,so you used to be more socially involved than you are now
4512,high_077,client,yeah don't do anything now a little T; more isolated yeah just working come home and sleep
4513,high_077,counsellor,so if there was something that you could do about this what do you think you might like to do
4514,high_077,client,well I don't want to stay like this this isn't Who I am you know just sleeping all the time this is I don't want to stay this way
4515,high_077,counsellor,kind of feels like you're stuck yes point
4516,high_077,client,yeah I just don't want to do anything or go out my friends anymore and just work and come home and sleep I don't want to do that
4517,high_077,counsellor,it's kind of the same old routine um I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression
4518,high_077,client,okay
4519,high_077,counsellor,like you would that be alright most of the time we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer so no medication at this point ation
4520,high_077,client,no
4521,high_077,counsellor,all right then I think as important certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that
4522,high_077,client,I'm okay with that you know when Mom was sick you know she was in hospice care so she had cancer and the nurses and the doctors you know had our family talked to someone you know about what we were feeling you know
4523,high_077,counsellor,so that was the face pretty good experience
4524,high_077,client,yeah yeah to talk to someone that understood what we were going through sure
4525,high_077,counsellor,something else might be exercised another possibility would be a natural product there are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate and those that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those
4526,high_077,client,may be something natural exercise I don't have energy I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything so I know I'm not going to exercise right now but if it's something that's natural you know I can maybe try that
4527,high_077,counsellor,okay if it's okay let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute and then we can hit some of those other things too okay so um is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death is she you don't want us out in the community
4528,high_077,client,she was really nice for me yeah I liked her
4529,high_077,counsellor,"so it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that could you say on a scale of zero to ten, ten being really ready, zero being not ready at all, how ready would you be to do some counselling"
4530,high_077,client,maybe like a six or seven
4531,high_077,counsellor,so a six or seven why a six or seven and not a four or a five
4532,high_077,client,well because I don't want to stay like this and you know I've already talked to her before she was really nice so I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know when I saw her last time if ever needed I could come back
4533,high_077,counsellor,so it sounds like you've got a connection there already that's really good yeah um does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that yeah I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again okay yeah well that's okay then it would be all right if we talked a little bit about the exercise I know you said that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine only you can make those decisions Alvina but if it's okay I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain okay exercises is again a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants okay I didn't know that yeah it actually raises serotonin have you heard about serotonin yeah I asked kind of the happy hormone yes so um it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF which is well it doesn't really matter what it is but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself so exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly and in actually improving the quality of sleep how does that sound at this point
4534,high_077,client,well if I try to exercise and if I call her to talk to her again does that mean I have to run the medication
4535,high_077,counsellor,right now we can try that absolutely again those are yours to sit your decisions and I'm I'm here to really support you in those so if those sound like things that you might be willing to do I'm I'm all for it well I'll try then let's go on the medication
4536,high_077,client,okay I have some friends they exercise and workout that I could probably call and exercise with them
4537,high_077,counsellor,so you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program yeah is that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group
4538,high_077,client,yeah I have friends that run and friends that go to gym I have some friends that walk after work
4539,high_077,counsellor,so it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do yeah which of those tend to interest you most
4540,high_077,client,well then also you know my church on the weekends they have exercise classes too so yeah but I think I guess I don't have energy really to exercise but I'll try it but I'll definitely call the person I had talked to a mom passed away and I'll do that right away
4541,high_077,counsellor,very good well I think it sounds like this is important for you to to feel better and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan how do you see this fitting into your life at this point again kind of getting back to the counseling and and the exercise
4542,high_077,client,well when I saw her I could see her after work so I can call her and see if I can still see her after work for therapy and exercise I mean I can do that you know after work or on the weekends my friends they exercise various time so
4543,high_077,counsellor,yeah let's talk a little bit more about that you're say on a scale of if we can do use another one of those scales zero being confident that you could start an exercise program zero being not very confident at all ten being very confident tell me where you are in this exercise thing
4544,high_077,client,honestly maybe a five okay and I'll try it it say if I have to do that so I have to go on medication then I'll try it okay that
4545,high_077,counsellor,sounds like a pretty strong commitment yes I'll try it okay and tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point
4546,high_077,client,then well you know my friends have been calling but you know I'm just sleeping all the time so when they call them sleep so I haven't really called them back but I know I can just return their calls and just let them know I'll want to meet up with them and you know at least maybe just start walking
4547,high_077,counsellor,I think that's a great decision you have a couple of friends in mind that you could call
4548,high_077,client,yeah real close close friends that live not too far from me yeah so tell me how to
4549,high_077,counsellor,tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise
4550,high_077,client,well I probably shouldn't come home I probably would need to call one of my friends and make a plan to maybe walk after work and take a change of clothes and maybe drive to one of my friends house after work and change with her
4551,high_077,counsellor,it would be difficult to do it in the morning you don't see that happening
4552,high_077,client,no because it's so hard when I get up in the room so tired that I can't I can't say doing in the morning
4553,high_077,counsellor,you think it would be easier to do it after work
4554,high_077,client,cuz I'm already out yeah as long as I don't come home so I come on Monica's sleep come home it's over yeah yeah all right
4555,high_077,counsellor,well good it sounds like we have a plan for the counselor and when you check out today I will put this in your record and that will want to get in touch with the counselor that you work with when your mom was going through okay her passing in the grief situation and then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program
4556,high_077,client,okay I'll try that
4557,high_077,counsellor,all right and if it's okay I'd like to call you in a week to one see how you're feeling and to the exercise is helping. you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial you may actually look forward to it. because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood. and then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things. now we've talked about exercise apartment we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point. but I want you to know you know you can call anytime and I will work to get you in. and that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working okay.
4558,high_078,client,well I came back here because I had to I had to make an appointment so I could get my prescription for my blood pressure medicine refilled and they wouldn't do it it wouldn't refill it it's a drugstore unless I came back here so
4559,high_078,counsellor,you're you're angry what
4560,high_078,client,well I'm not angry at you but I'm angry at the situation and I gotta come back in here take time off from work just to get that prescription filled but but you know you do what you got to do and
4561,high_078,counsellor,well I appreciate your bringing that up that is does sound frustrating but by coming in it gives us a chance to to sit down and and and talk and see how things are going with the medication which is what I'm most concerned about I know we started at about three months ago or so and I am real interested to hear how you're how you're doing on
4562,high_078,client,well uh yeah whenever I get my blood pressure checked at the drugstore it looks like I'm that it's working and that respect but it does seem to take away all my energy you know
4563,high_078,counsellor,kind of fatigued
4564,high_078,client,yeah yeah my I got no get up and go if you know what I mean
4565,high_078,counsellor,so kind of has taken the wind out of your sails
4566,high_078,client,absolutely yeah
4567,high_078,counsellor,how long have you noticed that oh I don't know I
4568,high_078,client,at least since I've been on this medication at least that long yeah
4569,high_078,counsellor,doesn't sound like it's working well too working too well for you have you tell me about how you're taking the medication have you taking it very regular
4570,high_078,client,oh yeah I take it I take it just like it says take it on the bottle you know I take it every morning when I get up
4571,high_078,counsellor,okay so you've been pretty consistent and taken the
4572,high_078,client,all yes
4573,high_078,counsellor,anything else going on in terms of symptoms no just this overall lack of energy which I know my wife doesn't particularly care for your wife tell me a little bit more about how it affects the relationship between the two of you well as I say I get up and go got up and went and there's not much going on between the two of us like there used to be so sexual performance is not as good as it as it might be
4574,high_078,client,nope but I think it's because of that damn medicine
4575,high_078,counsellor,so does this sound like something that you want to continue or should we talk about possibly other other options for you it sounds like it's kind of affecting your life negatively
4576,high_078,client,well yeah yeah but you know I I'm worried about my blood pressure because my my mother had a stroke not long ago and I know it was so they told us it was because of her high blood pressure so I don't want that to happen to me
4577,high_078,counsellor,so you're concerned about having a stroke
4578,high_078,client,well yeah I mean would you be you know it sort of runs in families I think
4579,high_078,counsellor,yeah so taking care of your blood pressure is is very important to you
4580,high_078,client,yeah yeah absolutely
4581,high_078,counsellor,again it doesn't sound like this particular medicines working out too well for you if it's okay I could talk to you about possibly changing the medication so on the one hand we'd be keeping your blood pressure under control but on the other hand we wouldn't be causing these types of side effects hopefully would that be okay
4582,high_078,client,well are you talking about on more medications or just a different medication
4583,high_078,counsellor,yeah so uh I think probably it sounds to me like probably changing medications at this point as a start we can always add another medication later if that becomes necessary
4584,high_078,client,yeah well I'm not real interested in adding any more but if changing it it would keep my blood pressure down but not take away all my energy than I might that give better idea
4585,high_078,counsellor,so you'd at least be willing to try a change and and see how that goes
4586,high_078,client,yeah yeah I know
4587,high_078,counsellor,well if it's okay I can tell you about a group of medications that I I like but if but first if it's okay that they give you a kind of my rationale for using that medication to start with so you know one of the things you'd mentioned to me was some of the financial concerns and the medication that you're on is pretty dirt-cheap and for most people at this dose particularly a low dose because you have mild hypertension most of the time it doesn't have many side effects obviously for you that was different does that make sense
4588,high_078,client,yeah yeah
4589,high_078,counsellor,so the medication I'm thinking about is something called an ACE inhibitor ACE inhibitors are very very well tolerated and occasionally people will get a dry hacky cough with them but it's fairly rare but there's very low risk of side effects in terms of sexual side effects in particular and most people as a matter of fact it's one of the the drugs that actually helps your heart beat a little bit stronger and better and many people don't have any kind of a decrease in their energy so how does that sound
4590,high_078,client,yeah it sounds though it sounds like a good idea if it still controls my blood pressure but doesn't take away my energy it sounds like a good idea
4591,high_078,counsellor,okay so what other things can you tell me about that might affect your blood pressure
4592,high_078,client,uh-oh uh-oh my work is sometimes stressful and some of the people I work with kind of drive me a little batty occasionally and I I don't know if it I don't really know if that it causes my blood pressure to go up or not but it certainly could I guess so there's some stressors at work
4593,high_078,counsellor,yeah and if it's okay I'm going to write down some of these things that as we talk through them so what else can affect blood pressure that you know of
4594,high_078,client,um well you know just mostly from watching TV shows I guess I am aware that alcohol and I drink some a moment that alcohol has some effect on blood pressure I think it might even say so on the label though I'm not sure it can't
4595,high_078,counsellor,it can't anything else you can think of
4596,high_078,client,no
4597,high_078,counsellor,well sometimes sometimes weight can be an issue and explain this little tool to you this is for what it's worth called a agenda mapping so it sounds like there's a number of things that you know of and then we can talk about that affect your blood pressure you mentioned stress and an alcohol and we talked about weight certainly you know blood pressure medication can affect you there and I would say another big one might be exercise does all that makes sense
4598,high_078,client,well yeah
4599,high_078,counsellor,so we could we can talk about a lot of these things with which one might you want to talk about and if we need to we can set up for appointment and talk about this more if we run out of time but
4600,high_078,client,well um exercise I'm I actually like to exercise and
4601,high_078,counsellor,tell me about the exercise that you're doing well I play golf and walk the golf course so you carry your bag or do
4602,high_078,client,Idrag it along on a pull cart my wife says that that doesn't count as exercise but I say try it yourself it is exercise
4603,high_078,counsellor,it is exercise it is exercise Michael look at your your weight when we came in yeah and you were about or so yeah which is actually according to your BMI body mass index in the in the overweight range how do you feel about that
4604,high_078,client,well I don't think I'm overweight
4605,high_078,counsellor,yeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about to pounds
4606,high_078,client,or pounds
4607,high_078,counsellor,yes or pounds
4608,high_078,client,I haven't weighed that since I was in high school
4609,high_078,counsellor,I understand I understand but you know I'm not saying that we need to lose pounds sometimes just a loss of pounds can make a tremendous impact on your on your blood pressure okay so pounds sounds like something that might be negotiable is the number okay let's go you do with thigh okay I think I can do all right so if you were to want to lose pounds how would you go about it
4610,high_078,client,I'd probably go back to the gym
4611,high_078,counsellor,has that worked in the past
4612,high_078,client,yeah I mean I used to go to the gym and work out a lot and uh I've done it for a while but I guess if if I'm I'm sure I could lose pounds if I wanted to
4613,high_078,counsellor,and that would actually kind of take care of two of these things right your weight and your exercise both of those would have a really positive effect I think on your on your blood pressure
4614,high_078,client,okay well
4615,high_078,counsellor,so we've talked about changing your medication stopping the medication you're on changing you to this ACE inhibitor and then perhaps looking at the weight and going getting back to the gym and starting an exercise program is that about right
4616,high_078,client,well what would it take for me to not have to take the medication at all
4617,high_078,counsellor,at all
4618,high_078,client,yeah I mean if I did enough exercise and lost enough weight would you not what I not need to take the medicine
4619,high_078,counsellor,I really wonder if you would I think that's an excellent question and if you're motivated to lose that kind of weight I'm with you I can't leave I this good
4620,high_078,client,I can lose five pounds well
4621,high_078,counsellor,it may it may take more than five pounds to get the desired effect on your blood pressure that's really getting back down into that normal weight range if you will in that one to range probably
4622,high_078,client,I I just want to make sure I understand if I if if I lose uh five pounds and I do it through exercise that I could you would recommend that I try going without the medicine for a while too and see what happens
4623,high_078,counsellor,I don't think I'm ready to go there yet Michael but it sounds to me like you want to get off of your medication
4624,high_078,client,yeah if I can yeah
4625,high_078,counsellor,"Well, is there a blood pressure rate that you are right now, blood pressure number that you are right now? I probably wouldn't recommend that. That's going to take a plan for us to work out over probably a period of months. So that you could, one, lose a little bit more weight, two, exercise really regularly. We might want to talk about the alcohol. Can I ask you how much you're drinking now on a regular basis?"
4626,high_078,client,two or three beers a day
4627,high_078,counsellor,two or three yeah it is okay I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about alcohol and its effect on blood pressure Merryn research has shown that for men more than two drinks a day and for what more than one drink a day really can significantly impact your blood pressure negatively it raises blood pressure how does that how does that sit with you
4628,high_078,client,you're saying two or three more than two more than three okay so two is still considered aa safe and regard to blood pressure
4629,high_078,counsellor,that's what most of the research shows
4630,high_078,client,okay I'll do two
4631,high_078,counsellor,you'll do two okay and you said that you did two three every day most every day yeah sometimes a little more on the weekend I guess can you think of any ways to maybe cut back on that to where you wouldn't be getting as much alcohol in your system on a regular basis
4632,high_078,client,oh yeah I guess I could you know I mean uh I you know I don't I I don't have a drinking problem so I could take a day or two and not drink at all if but if if two a day doesn't hurt my blood pressure um I think I could go with that
4633,high_078,counsellor,so two a day um keep in mind too there are significant amounts of calories involved and alcohol particularly beer
4634,high_078,client,I suppose I could drink Light beer
4635,high_078,counsellor,light beer doesn't appeal to you
4636,high_078,client,might as well not drink beer at all you drink Light beer but I suppose if I suppose I could do that
4637,high_078,counsellor,"Scale of zero to ten, zero being not willing at all to do that, ten being very willing to do that, where do you think you"
4638,high_078,client,probably about it I
4639,high_078,counsellor,why did you say a five and not a three or four
4640,high_078,client,just because uh you know doc habits are hard to break you know and it usually don't drink Light beer and so it would be a change it would be something different but uh well you know I'm willing to give it a try
4641,high_078,counsellor,tell me the good things about cutting back on alcohol and maybe switching to light beer talking about the good things well I did you know
4642,high_078,client,"Obviously a good thing is I'd probably lose weight, which is what we're trying to do here."
4643,high_078,counsellor,so you'd lose weight
4644,high_078,client,uh and there there may be other things about alcohol that has something to do with blood pressure that I did not understand but but I suppose it would help keep my blood pressure down and my weight low or if I didn't drink as much beer or if I drank light beer and so that's the good side the bad side is I don't like it as much
4645,high_078,counsellor,"On a scale of zero to ten, zero being not very important and ten being very important, how important is it for you to get better control of your blood pressure?"
4646,high_078,client,very important I put that up really pretty high I'll give that a nine
4647,high_078,counsellor,so interms of making a change what are some of the things that you'd be willing to do in order to make that happen
4648,high_078,client,well you know I'm willing to do the things but most of what we've just talked about which are um drinking Light beer drinking no more than two beers a day going to the gym again and sticking with a different medicine for a while
4649,high_078,counsellor,okay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go
4650,high_078,client,yeah I think I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my blood pressure at a level that doesn't concern me and if this is what it takes I'm going to give this a try
4651,high_078,counsellor,so one more scale in terms of your readiness to make to do this zero being not ready at all and ten being ready where would you fall on that
4652,high_078,client,six and a half
4653,high_078,counsellor,six and a half and watch six and a happen and not two or three
4654,high_078,client,because I know when I walk out of here that if I keep doing what I'm doing I I'm either going to have to live with the blood pressure medicine that takes all my energy away and I don't like that or I'm going to have to let my blood pressure get real high and I know that can cause all sorts of bad things to happen
4655,high_078,counsellor,so you're really worried again about the health consequences of not keeping your blood pressure under control
4656,high_078,client,people keep telling me that high blood pressure causes all sorts of bad things to happen so yes I am concerned about
4657,high_078,counsellor,that so if it's okay I'm going to put this in your record that we talked about well we're certainly going to switch your medication but you're going to be working on losing some weight going back to the gym cutting down on your beer usage and switching to light beer is there anything I missed
4658,high_078,client,five pounds
4659,high_078,counsellor,five pounds that's the number now I'd like to see you back and about let's call it a month let's see back in a month
4660,high_078,client,I'm the five pounds going by then my
4661,high_078,counsellor,pounds will be gone and we'll see how things are going and probably talk about this some more and see how successful you've been with this plan and then we'll go from there
4662,high_079,client,hello how are you
4663,high_079,counsellor,it's good to see you up and about how are you feeling after your last little hospitalization
4664,high_079,client,well it was pretty scary I'm I'm definitely improving but I don't feel as well as I think I should um the COFF is a lot better but my breathing is still not what I think it should be right now
4665,high_079,counsellor,so you're you're still struggling to breathe some
4666,high_079,client,I guess you could call it struggling I just when I walked to the mailbox or up the stairs I get out of breath easily
4667,high_079,counsellor,exercise tends to make the breathing worse
4668,high_079,client,it does seem so yes
4669,high_079,counsellor,so you're better but not quite where you want to be and
4670,high_079,client,I'm definitely not where I think I should be I feel like I should be better by now usually after a cough or bronchitis I'm able to breathe easily and it's not like that this time
4671,high_079,counsellor,so you usually bounce back pretty quickly but this time is taking longer and that's a that's a real concern to you
4672,high_079,client,it was when I was with you in the hospital you gave me a little oxygen in the beginning and I just never thought I would be a person that would have to have oxygen that was scary too
4673,high_079,counsellor,so that the oxygen piece is something that scary it almost feels like ear were really really sick when you needed oxygen it does I never picture myself needing a I guess I'm scared of needing an oxygen tank and carrying it around with me and having the tubes in my nose um that I just don't see myself needing that I always think of myself as being healthy and now it seems like you may have some real or some permanent damage
4674,high_079,client,that's what it seems like
4675,high_079,counsellor,Paige would it be okay if we talked a little bit about your disease process
4676,high_079,client,sure
4677,high_079,counsellor,you know with a flare-up of bronchitis like this you very well may have done some damage to your lungs the good news is as you continue to heal I mean we have a spirometry today which is that breathing test that you did we compared that about six months ago it is quite a bit worse now a lot of that will get better with time but also a lot of that kind of depends upon whether you continue to smoke or not
4678,high_079,client,oh this one we're going to talk about my smoking huh
4679,high_079,counsellor,well Paige we don't have to talk about anything you don't want to talk about um those are going to be decisions that only you can make I can't make you quit and so that's just going to have to be your decision I I want you to know though that I'm here to support you and even though we've talked about smoking cessation and some things that you could do in the past you've been kind of resistant about that I wonder if having this bout in the hospital has done anything to change your mind
4680,high_079,client,well I think I need to seriously think about it again I just evidently my health is on the line because it it was just a really bad experience for me
4681,high_079,counsellor,so bad experience mm-hmm so if we look down the road maybe five ten years and you decided not to quit smoking what do you think that would look like for you
4682,high_079,client,probably not good I would see me not being able to breathe at all and again just my biggest fear would be needing oxygen every day all day
4683,high_079,counsellor,oxygen is a pretty strong motivator for you isn't it yeah well so it sounds like if it sounds to me like if if you didn't quit smoking that you feel like your overall health might really be at risk
4684,high_079,client,yes
4685,high_079,counsellor,where does that where does that leave you I need to start considering it more seriously than I have in the past if I want a different outcome okay at this point Paige it's great and but let's talk about it's okay what's something called a decision balance so and involves four things to think about it's almost like writing it on a page but we're going to do it in the air or whatever so what are the good things about smoking that you like if you didn't side to quit what are some of the negatives about smoking if you didn't decide to quit and then if you did quit what would be some of the good things and then what would be some of the negative things if you did quit so tell me if you would what are some of the good things about that you like about smoking if you continue to smoke the way you are
4686,high_079,client,okay um I like the taste I like how it feels in my throat I love the social aspect of it I have smoking friends I have non-smoking friends and just when I'm with my friends that smoke it is just a lot of fun it's just something we do as loud as that sounds um and I love it with my coffee first thing whirring a lot
4687,high_079,counsellor,so some of the good things are the taste we regularly with coffee and how it makes you feel and then it sounds like there's a big social component to smoking for you there is tell me about then what would be some of the negatives if you continued to smoke and didn't quit
4688,high_079,client,my health that would be the number one things that are negative about smoking the snow and my clothes my hair and that it's a lot of people that are surround myself with it's not socially acceptable anymore and that does make me uncomfortable
4689,high_079,counsellor,so some of the negative things would be it's a impact on your health right the the smell clothes and so forth and then there's a lot of kind of social pushback
4690,high_079,client,yes there is
4691,high_079,counsellor,with cigarette smoking I see what else
4692,high_079,client,well you know my husband Dan recently stopped smoking and was it yeah he's done quite well but now it's seems like he's righteous and I'm an addict and he says things like you could just do it if you'll just do it you know what those cigarettes are gonna do to you why don't you just stop I tell them I've stopped a hundred times and I'll stop when I'm ready but it you know that's put a strain on things
4693,high_079,counsellor,it does sound like he's concerned about you and and concerned about your health and that he loves you
4694,high_079,client,I know it just doesn't feel that way sometimes but I know that he would be supportive because he wants what's best for me
4695,high_079,counsellor,but it's on the other hand it's it's hard to put up with some of that stuff and I think I think it shows a lot of inner strength in you to put up with some of that even though it's kind of a pain
4696,high_079,client,well thank you I'd like to think so
4697,high_079,counsellor,so what would be some of the positives some of the good things about quitting based on what you told me here today
4698,high_079,client,even if I have some permanent damage you encouraged me to believe that if I stopped that I could get better and definitely avoid the oxygen tank that would be the biggest positive the second positive was that Dan and I would have a little more peace in our home and get along better and he would see that I you know want to be on the planet my clothes would smell better my hair would smell better a car would smell better I wouldn't have to worry about you know sneaking somewhere when I wanted to smoke and it wasn't socially acceptable in the situation I'm in so there are a lot of positives okay
4699,high_079,counsellor,so again on one hand there are a lot of good things that you enjoy about smoking and on the other hand there you've given me quite a list of things that if you did quit there would be a lot of ways that your life would be better so where does that leave you now
4700,high_079,client,but I just really need to do this and to concentrate on the good things and just be ready to stop I just need to stop
4701,high_079,counsellor,sounds like you're pretty committed so honest let's talk about a scale then on in terms of being ready to quit zero being not ready at all and ten being like yeah I'm really ready to quit where are you on that do you think
4702,high_079,client,I'm gonna say an eight
4703,high_079,counsellor,an eight why an eight not a five or six
4704,high_079,client,it all just goes back to this recent event and the fears that I have or where it would be I'll go back to your five to ten years from now and that's just not
4705,high_079,counsellor,not a pretty picture no no it's not tell me some of the things that you are aware of that can help you in this quest
4706,high_079,client,well I'm very familiar with nicotine gum and nicotine patches I do wear the patch and they work very well for me um especially at work because I'm not allowed to smoke at work nor but I want to be smoking at work again with the people that I'm with um and that's really about all I've ever tried or called Turkey and that just never will I never want to offer you mm-hmm
4707,high_079,counsellor,do you know about the NC quit line
4708,high_079,client,I've heard the commercials on the radio but I've never looked into it
4709,high_079,counsellor,would it be okay if we talked about that for a minute sir this is a fantastic program page they have a lot of information but the great thing is you can actually have your own personal smoking counselor and you can call them or you can leave a message with them to call you but there's a tremendous amount of support there and that's been a very helpful thing and the great thing for me is they will actually call me and give me kind of follow-up information on how you're doing mmm how does that how does it sound
4710,high_079,client,sounds very intriguing sounds like it could be helpful yeah not just depend on Dan with my journey yeah
4711,high_079,counsellor,so he's just uh sounds like more support right you wouldn't feel you wouldn't feel alone in this battle right yeah so I heard the nicotine patches and gum and then possibly the Quitline anything else that you've heard about or that you might be interested in there
4712,high_079,client,well I do know Dan um had a quit date is that something I have to do
4713,high_079,counsellor,again decisions that only you can make H and but if it's okay I can tell you a little bit about the research about the quit date okay um most of the research shows that if indeed you can kind of look at your calendar and see a time that would be better to quit them than not it's really helpful to have a quit date and to tell as many people as you can about that this is the day I'm quitting again it tends to garner that social support and increases the commitment level how does that sound
4714,high_079,client,well that makes sense why it would be better than just today will be the day
4715,high_079,counsellor,is there any time that would be better for you to get a quit date than another day
4716,high_079,client,we do have some plans coming up so I think a week from Monday socially would be better that's the day a week from it yes
4717,high_079,counsellor,would it be okay if our office called you on that day to just begin to give you a little bit more support let you know that we're with you sure that would begin so let's go back to another one of those scales scale of 0 to 10 in terms of your confidence about doing this zero being no confidence 10 being they have a lot of confidence about my ability to quit where would you be on that scale
4718,high_079,client,I think with everything we discussed today I would like to leave on a and that's how I feel that's tremendous it is tremendous good good feels good feels I could still be a little weary
4719,high_079,counsellor,but it feels good
4720,high_079,client,yeah but it feels like you have a play on this time good as what I feel better
4721,high_079,counsellor,well congratulations I think that's probably the biggest health decision that you could possibly make in your life particularly in light of what you've just been through so right I think this is a really good time and I have I applaud your courage doing it takes a lot to to make this decision so good for you
4722,high_079,client,well thank you
4723,high_079,counsellor,so I will call you and we'll give you some information about the Quitline when you leave you can take care of the patches and and gums instead of over-the-counter and if it's okay let's schedule an appointment and two to three weeks out and get you back and see how things are going
4724,high_080,client,well I came today because my daughters in the hospital as well I think it's important to quit but I enjoy smoking I'm not ready to give it up right now my life is too much in turmoil
4725,high_080,counsellor,so I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about but that overall coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter so can you tell me what was it that made it possible for you to even come in what were some of the things you were thinking about
4726,high_080,client,"I think it's important because I feel I'm a bad role model for my children. My daughter is turning, and already some of her friends have tried smoking. I don't want her to think it's a good thing."
4727,high_080,counsellor,so the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking
4728,high_080,client,I smoked when I was young and I certainly don't want it for her
4729,high_080,counsellor,and it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately
4730,high_080,client,well that's true it seems so hard I'm just not ready for this right now
4731,high_080,counsellor,so Center what's good about smoking what do you like about it
4732,high_080,client,it's very enjoyable relaxing you know it stress reliever when I'm at work we all go out and smoke and chitchat and you know talk about things I would hate to not smoke really I'd be left out
4733,high_080,counsellor,what else tell me what else is good about it
4734,high_080,client,mmm I like to have a cigarette after I eat it sort of tells my brain I'm finished stop eating I'm full so it's it's a way to you know sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack so it's a way to control my weight
4735,high_080,counsellor,okay so is there anything else that you like about it
4736,high_080,client,let me think well I just enjoy it I think it's um it's not good for me I know but I'm so used to smoking I don't really think about quitting too much
4737,high_080,counsellor,so let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking the things that you like about it and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out okay so it sounds like it's a way to relax it's a way to socialize with your friends from work and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke
4738,high_080,client,that's true yeah
4739,high_080,counsellor,you also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight and concern that if you were we're going to quit smoking what that would do in terms of gaining weight and that smoking after meals is pleasurable that it's something that would be really hard to give up yeah I also heard that it's very much a part of your life it's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a nonsmoker does that capture for you some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking
4740,high_080,client,exactly
4741,high_080,counsellor,so I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking what about the other side can you tell me about some of the not so good thing
4742,high_080,client,well I I'm worried about my children I feel like I'm being a bad parent and I often wonder you know they've seen me smoke for years I certainly don't want my twelve-year-old daughter to start smoking and some of her friends are already smoking
4743,high_080,counsellor,"Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?"
4744,high_080,client,yeah just this morning I was outside having a cigarette and when I looked up there she was looking out the window watching me smoke
4745,high_080,counsellor,so this morning that experience it really brought home how she does watch you and she does really look up to you and notice what you do how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you
4746,high_080,client,I felt terrible you know I was projecting I want to be a good parent I don't feel this really is part of the plan
4747,high_080,counsellor,and again thanks for your honesty and talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know the one hand you talked about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter mm-hmm and on the other hand I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief socializing and it's something you can't imagine ever changing how do those two things fit together
4748,high_080,client,it doesn't fit you know it's the opposite side of the coin you know I love to do it but I don't think it's right
4749,high_080,counsellor,so what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important that raised it up in the list of priorities for you I can't think of anything right now okay I don't have any plans to quit it's just something I'm thinking about so it's not so much that you don't want to quit in a way it's almost how could I do it that would work for me exactly okay I appreciate we we probably used up the time that we have I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this is that something that would be helpful oh sure
4750,high_080,client,sure I'll come in yes
4751,high_080,counsellor,"Good talk about tomorrow. Not necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you're willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. We have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do. One of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things, as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?"
4752,high_080,client,okay okay I'll give it a try
4753,high_080,counsellor,okay here you go thank you so thanks for coming in Sandra we'll see you next week all right
4754,high_081,client,hello Doctor
4755,high_081,counsellor,so what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago
4756,high_081,client,well I did what we discussed I did the journal okay a week trying to mark down the the difference in my smoking being more aware when I would had the urge if I could stop the urge and I found it was okay it got a little bit scary on the weekend because the urge is kept on coming sure to have a cigarette butt during the week I was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week and that's just in one week so
4757,high_081,counsellor,so you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes that's amazing I mean given how much you were smoking yeah you were able to keep the the journal you guys like you did that and that allowed you to really focus on the time when we were delaying your secret so so that's gone well so one of the things that are not going as well as you'd liked
4758,high_081,client,it just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend right and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day instead of at work and I found that it was really hard to stop those urges
4759,high_081,counsellor,ok so these automatic cigarettes when you're socializing and you have time on your hands really other problems that you're facing yes and that you've noticed other more difficult than the others
4760,high_081,client,but I marked it in the book that's one thing I said to myself I'll be honest in my marking been walking down ok so I'm going to have to really be aware of the weekends maybe get some kind of hobby or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy
4761,high_081,counsellor,ok so and you thought about already what you might do is such as getting a hobby any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this
4762,high_081,client,if I could just postpone it ok and say okay I'm not gonna have it at home right I'll have it when I get to work or on the way to work that because I sure and then what I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house
4763,high_081,counsellor,ok so from now to the next time you come back and see me what is it that you'd like to to work on I think I just like to do what I did this first week I like the idea of marking it down ok so you can continue with that and it took me a week and I i'm down to cigarettes a day I figure sure what I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes in other words another three a day okay and because I smoked a large pack in a small pack maybe just two small packs you said five cigarettes this time yes and any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen
4764,high_081,client,I can try each day to count right and I'm still going to try that when I get the urge to let it go fight it and maybe not go for a cigarette until the next urge comes right. So if I look at it between two of them sure. And also coming back and talking to you really helps because I have someone to discuss it with.
4765,high_081,counsellor,so given what you're attempting to do when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this
4766,high_081,client,I wouldn't mind coming back in a week again because this is all new and a week I can handle a week
4767,high_081,counsellor,absolutely okay okay doctor will see you in a week yes thank you
4768,high_082,client,well doctor I made an appointment with you finally because I was diagnosed over three months ago with the pulmonary disease COPD yes and although I didn't call right away I really need some help in quitting smoking right so I thought well this is my first step so it's time to do something
4769,high_082,counsellor,something okay so you've been diagnosed by this progress brother just diagnosed that and and how are you feeling right now
4770,high_082,client,I'm I'm really scared because I don't feel well I haven't felt well for a while I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers
4771,high_082,counsellor,It sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened
4772,high_082,client,mm-hmm I I don't know what I'm going to do about it okay
4773,high_082,counsellor,no have you thought about when you want to quit
4774,high_082,client,fine I'm giving myself six months six months and and that seems like a long time away but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time I don't even have % faith in myself
4775,high_082,counsellor,okay so what I'm hearing you say is that although you want to quit smoking in the next six months you're feeling a bit under confident that you'll actually be able to do this and your word about failing
4776,high_082,client,"I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch. I've gone through therapy. Nothing's helped. I finally, I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit."
4777,high_082,counsellor,so you've been able to quit smoking but only when you were in the hospital
4778,high_082,client,I had no choice I have no choice and then next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked okay
4779,high_082,counsellor,let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with this could you tell me what is good about smoking for you
4780,high_082,client,it's part of my life it's I started smoking when I was at home my parents smoked all their friends smoked it was on television everybody looks so grand smoking and all dressed up and and fancy clothes and had me be having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal I didn't really think about it's just an extension of me I guess it's good for my nerves right I mean I feel like it is I know when I've got a package in my pocket or I know if I'm going through some stress I say oh I'll have a cigarette and think this out sure
4781,high_082,counsellor,so gene I want to make sure that I understood what you've told me of what do you find good about smoking so it helps you calm down it gives you something to do it's been part of your image you feel sophisticated you feel like a movie star in fact the way you talk about it seems like that's what it makes you feel like is that right that's right okay is there anything I missed
4782,high_082,client,um I enjoyed it just it relaxes me it's great after a meal yes um free mm-hmm we all just do it it's a little group of people my family right the people I work with we go out in the courtyard have a cigarette and talk that's how you make friends a lot of people would like a little group now we're all a little bunch of us
4783,high_082,counsellor,so it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you're smoking and it's so easy to go and take a break and have a cigarette
4784,high_082,client,I never thought of it that way but probably you're right now
4785,high_082,counsellor,you've told me what is good about smoking for you ah can you tell me what it's not so good about smoking for you
4786,high_082,client,well it's bad for my health and it's scaring because I don't feel well I haven't felt well for a while I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers
4787,high_082,counsellor,is there anything else that's not good abouts looking for you
4788,high_082,client,um it's expensive really god expensive and I smoked sometimes cigarettes a day and I'm starting to buy a different makeup because I'm starting to really age starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics
4789,high_082,counsellor,okay so let me make sure I've understood this piece as well so they're not good things on the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health the effects on your physical appearance on how you look and the amount of investment that you do making in makeup and in getting your nails done etc and then the cost of smoking yes so so let me ask you this given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of  to  where  is the most important thing to do and one would be the least important thing to do how important is it for you to quit smoking
4790,high_082,client,it's for me for my health and for the money and everything I said I would say it's  or out of  that I should quit smoking
4791,high_082,counsellor,definitely most important
4792,high_082,client,yes a hundred percent one of the most important things
4793,high_082,counsellor,let me ask another question and follow-up to that again given everything going on where is the most confident you ever felt about anything and one is the least confident how confident are you that you will be able to quit
4794,high_082,client,um I'd say or percent confident sorrowful yeah I'd like to say more but um
4795,high_082,counsellor,okay now help me understand why you said and not something like or because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit
4796,high_082,client,well I'm I guess I'm still a fighter and III it's starting - I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you so this was big step so I guess yes it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week okay
4797,high_082,counsellor,so you've said to percent what would it take to build that confidence to about %
4798,high_082,client,maybe if I could come to see you again or maybe some ideas were suggested maybe if there was a group or something I I don't know but I need some help
4799,high_082,counsellor,so if you got help that would help you say that you went from % to %
4800,high_082,client,I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today okay. Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out okay.
4801,high_082,counsellor,so Jean I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important for a step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time but as the first small step I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week and the reason why I say that is because as you were mentioning to me smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act and I notice that you were saying to me you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes and sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing and that's often the first small step what are your thoughts about that
4802,high_082,client,in other words think about it more don't don't just do it automatically
4803,high_082,counsellor,that's correct and writing it down helps that process
4804,high_082,client,yeah I think so because and when I get the urge I could maybe fight it and maybe wait till the next urge and maybe mark that down that I didn't go right away when something went wrong and yes I can try that
4805,high_082,counsellor,okay and I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it and then if you can bring that back to the next appointment it could be something we could discuss okay anything else
4806,high_082,client,no that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week
4807,high_082,counsellor,excellent well thank you so much for coming in today and thank you for seeing me doctor you're welcome
4808,high_083,client,they've been doing a little better yes
4809,high_083,counsellor,we'll talk about that you know it looks like on here that your ac is down a little bit I think it's down to about ten now yeah so you've really been making some progress tell me about how it's been going
4810,high_083,client,well I do exercise a lot more I exercise a lot more yes I have my little portion controls they don't have too much of a certain food I make sure that you know I have my insulin at the right time the right amount
4811,high_083,counsellor,so it sounds like you've really been doing a couple different things that have been working for you it's exercising more which I want to hear about and you've been really looking more at your portion sizes yes you know those measuring pieces we had talked to talk some time about yes and then the third one is Oh taking your insulin at the right times okay I'm really the schedule on where it is yes does that seem to be making you feel better as far as the insulin or what do you noticing
4812,high_083,client,um I've noticed that well I'm very sure we discussed this before when I used to go out I used to just kind of check my blood sugar and make sure that it was low enough to have whatever I kind of wanted to okay I see right yes well now I mean I still go friends of course but as you should as I said um but one like once I go out now I kind of I tried looking for something like if my friends are gonna have a candy bar or something I try looking for maybe a granola bar or something that's a that's like sort of like a candy bar but it's a little healthier and I know that it won't rise my blood sugar that much
4813,high_083,counsellor,so you've been looking for other alternatives so you still feel like you're doing one but they're doing I'm looking at the carbs a little or seeing where it would be with your sugars
4814,high_083,client,yeah like I mean of course I'm teenager I still love candy or whatever but
4815,high_083,counsellor,nobody can stop you from having candy completely exactly
4816,high_083,client,but you know I still try go to go out and have fun I mean even though my friends do eat whatever they kind of want I just I take better better care of myself I eat something healthier it's something that'll make me feel more energetic instead of like a little sugar rush and then just crash later on
4817,high_083,counsellor,so you know how you feel when you get that sugar rush and cry yes that feeling hasn't been something you've enjoyed in the past yeah so you've you've been feeling a little more even keel it sounds like how that's going so talking about the exercise piece you say you've been exercising more what have you been enjoying
4818,high_083,client,well now that I'm in school I mean I tried out for the basketball team yeah hey yes
4819,high_083,counsellor,oh I know you said you're really looking forward to that
4820,high_083,client,yes and it's a lot of fun I enjoy it the workouts are pretty harsh but I like it I have fun I enjoy it and you haven't been feeling as though your sugar that you want to crash during checkouts
4821,high_083,counsellor,you've been able to manage while you're out with your energy level
4822,high_083,client,yeah I mean I always keep some fast-acting sugar on me just in case super I'm glad crash
4823,high_083,counsellor,and that had added something you've had to use or haven't had to use during exercise also know how good deal good so you've been able to kind of go into it with the right sugar level yes so that you haven't bottom doubt well with all these things that you've been working on so well what what's your main goal right now what's something that you're you know really trying to be focused on for you
4824,high_083,client,well my main goal is well I've lowered my ac a little bit but I'm trying to get it to where it's really actually supposed to be so that sure myself healthy you know
4825,high_083,counsellor,so so keep moving in that direction we've got it from a from a down to a which is a huge success in the time period that we've been looking at and maybe let's try to move it down even a little further to you know nine to start and move down to an eight exactly okay so that's that's that's great so the bigger goal is getting the ac down a little and then these smaller pieces are your what you're doing to make that happen yes so how important is it for you to have an ac let's say eight in the next six months on a scale of one to ten kinda like that pain scale we use where would you put yourself on a scale of one to ten just how important it is
4826,high_083,client,I would actually have to say about an eighth
4827,high_083,counsellor,it's an eighth Wow so it's not a two or three it's an eighth
4828,high_083,client,my goal I want I really want to reach my goal I want to be able to feel good and you know I want to make sure that I know that I'm healthy and that I know I was the one who did this for myself
4829,high_083,counsellor,but you said it wasn't about your mom it wasn't about dr. Smith but it was about what Elizabeth wanted yes so what would it take to move you just a little bit higher up to a nine as far as importance what would have to happen
4830,high_083,client,I'm not really sure actually I mean it's really important to me but I do have you know has to have school and sports exactly you know I have to worry about other things too
4831,high_083,counsellor,we all have a lot of things we're juggling to be honest I don't think anyone can ever really be a ten in terms of importance because we have all these things that we have to manage sometimes they're higher up and sometimes they're lower up depending on the day or even the minute so I'm that same kind of scale of to where would you put yourself in terms of how confident you are that you can bring down your ac - what did we say at within the next six months how confident are you that you can make that happen
4832,high_083,client,about a actually
4833,high_083,counsellor,Wow yeah wow that is awesome so tell me about that
4834,high_083,client,well I'm really confident because I mean if I was able to get my blood my ac from to and only a couple of months yes I've believed that I can do the same thing again thank you what I'm doing up
4835,high_083,counsellor,so really just continuing to do what you're doing you've already shown here in the last few months that you've dropped it substantially and I'm sure you were really excited to get to see that score you know to see what the number was really gonna be
4836,high_083,client,yeah it made me feel really good I know that I'm doing better and that I'm healthier so
4837,high_083,counsellor,did you have a sense when you came in did you have an idea of what you thought your number might be
4838,high_083,client,I did actually because I know that before I wasn't doing as well as I I could and by pushing myself I knew that you know what I know it's lower. I know that I did good and I've been taking care of myself. I know it's most definitely lower okay.
4839,high_083,counsellor,so you could feel confident coming in at hey when I see that number I already know the work I've been doing so it darn well better be lower because yes we're not put into this so that makes sense it sounds like for you just continue to do what you're doing continue on with getting onto the basketball team and you know continuing on with those things you're playing out with your with your insulin you haven't been in the hospital now for over months so I mean that's you know that's a huge progress in success as far as keeping yourself stable and feeling good and enjoying high school yeah so how bout we check back again you know an hour another days and just kind of see where that the ac is then yeah and kind of go from there and you know if you have any questions or you're not sure about something by all means you can stop and that's what we're here for okay thanks Liz it's great talking to you today it's great down you too you
4840,high_084,client,yeah well my wife basically just said if I don't get um final stop drinking then she's leaving
4841,high_084,counsellor,Wow okay so she's doing pretty tough stance on it
4842,high_084,client,yeah yeah she said you know she's told me for a long time that she doesn't like it and our kids have said they don't like it she's never she's kind of threatened it but I think she needs it this time I don't
4843,high_084,counsellor,okay all right so pretty important to you I mean she's taking the stance on it your kids have said similar things and now you're here I mean it's gotten point that you've you agreed to go ahead and go into treatment she's saying not just get treatment she's saying quit I mean Jesus she's being pretty yeah she just wants me to stop pretty out of about it okay so what do you think
4844,high_084,client,well I'm thinking that I've worked hard my whole life and I should be able to to drink if I want but you know I don't you know I never been arrested you know I've got I've done really good with the money that we have you know we live a pretty good life she gets to do what you wanted I get to do what I want and this is just something that I want to do so you know I and it's been that that you know I've been drinking since I think we met yeah we can vary it a long time oh so I don't know what I I'm kind of like I know what the big deal is really and all right I don't want to quit
4845,high_084,counsellor,what's always you feel you know I mean it's like you know you work you're responsible you do what you think is expected of you and so it kind of feels a little unfair to you know you're a man you're a head of the household you know you're doing your duty and it feels a little unfair to have people trying to dictate your behavior and telling if you've got to give this up
4846,high_084,client,yeah I don't like it people tell me what to do yeah no no usually I just usually if someone tells me what to do like tell him to back off wouldn't what to do and so but she's serious it's time so I don't know what to do
4847,high_084,counsellor,so all right all right well so I guess that's kind of the that's the dilemma I guess you know on the one hand she's uh she's very out of it she's very concerned and is making her expectation very clear on the other hand you know you're being asked to give up something that you don't particularly want to give up um what do you think what do you think she's what you put why do you think she's so concerned
4848,high_084,client,well she says she's worried about my health you know cuz I have high blood pressure you know worried about because my dad died of a heart attack at a really early age so she's afraid I'm just gonna I'm just gonna drop dead you know I outlive my dad by so many years and I you know and again it's my life yeah so yeah
4849,high_084,counsellor,yeah certainly it's you know people can tell you what they want right you know and but all ultimately it's up to your choice what you're gonna do so you know she she can threaten you and she can she can tell you that you know if you don't do this she can you know she's gonna leave and she can leave you know it sounds like you really don't really don't want that
4850,high_084,client,but but you know everybody's got their choices to make in this situation
4851,high_084,counsellor,okay so she's concerned about your health and has pointed out that you have a you know your father so he drank and
4852,high_084,client,that's but I was really little okay when when he died so I don't know
4853,high_084,counsellor,so you're not sure if that we died of heart attack okay you know so you're not sure if that played a role in his heart attack or not I probably did probably crank song but so you're not sure about how well you know he died did it earlier and she points that out as evidence that like you've got media genetic predisposition to having health related problems associated with drinking
4854,high_084,client,yeah the dollar I've said I should quit drinking the dog or they know okay you're not convinced but with the dog don't exactly that years ago I need to quit drinking
4855,high_084,counsellor,okay so it almost seems like evidence to the opposite they told you to quit drinking years ago and here you are it's still alive then
4856,high_084,client,I pretty much do whatever I want when I yeah you know surely no life because the way it's been. I've given everybody wrong yeah of everybody. Okay. Wow.
4857,high_084,counsellor,okay so you feel like you know you beaten the odds so else you can say the live
4858,high_084,client,yeah you can say that okay max I'll work my way up I'm working my way up and once really high up my confident for a retiree okay huh you've always thought I would do it
4859,high_084,counsellor,so it's kind of you know the state you know you have this determination you're the kind of person that you know you you do what you trust your gut and you do what you think you should do and you know you work real really hard and you and you've had a lot of success in your life is right it seems like in your in your job and and and with your family the fact that you're a married man with kids and you know you've raised them up and you know I think there's no denying that you had a lot of success in real life in it and and you know and you know better than anyone how hard you had to work could she be back so
4860,high_084,client,um and she doesn't get she doesn't she wasn't I don't think she recognized how hard I worked for it to have what we have okay you know and I wish she just let me live the life I've always wanted to live you know and then part of its drinking I like drinking so okay
4861,high_084,counsellor,okay all right so she's got all these concerns about it how do you and you mentioned your kids have some concerns - they talk about it I mean what is your sense of and it sounds like so far you feel like well I've beaten the odds and I'm this kind of guy like I'm always a kind of guy that sort of pushes the envelope and you know has proven a lot of people wrong over the years and so you're very skeptical when anyone tells you that drinking is going to kill you like yeah is it it's almost like if somebody tells you that you're gonna say you know you're not gonna believe that I mean you just don't believe that's the truth
4862,high_084,client,well I would yeah because it might kill other people but I'm not going to let kill me
4863,high_084,counsellor,okay okay all right so what so what if anything in what they're telling you do you believe it turns out like a possible negative effects that I may have obviously it has not killed you you're standing here right now yeah okay so as it killed you but do you think but have you seen any do you think there's anything to anything any validity to what your wife is saying your kids and the doctors with regards to having a negative effect on your health or otherwise I mean just just very honestly if you sit there and you look back and kind of go well and is there anything that you think that is going on that that it's valid right now
4864,high_084,client,if I if I tell you what I'm really thinking are you tell my wife but
4865,high_084,counsellor,no no I mean confidentiality is such that no I want you to know I'd never feel comfortable talking I do not assess us but you know
4866,high_084,client,I think you you I think you kind of get me kind understanding so I really you know my um my son's in AAA okay and and you know when he went into his treat treatment and he really was hard on me like he said that he blamed me for him you know get you know going down that path and and and I really felt like maybe I could have done more he and i were really close now we're not as close because he I can tell you this doesn't like to be around me as I drink and my daughter is she sent me a letter a while ago saying that she loved me and that she didn't want me to die and wanted my kids to be around her but her kids to be around me but she um she didn't want him around as much because cuz she didn't like it when I'm drinking so well so yeah I've had I've had those couple things that that maybe go maybe maybe that maybe I need to rethink this yeah and then I'm always one way and that's really like I still want to lose her I just don't
4867,high_084,counsellor,well you know gosh I really appreciate the Jew did you feel comfortable sharing with me to know who those things with me and and I can see that you know this has been very painful and I just I can't commend you enough for being willing to put yourself out there and come in and trust this process it's not easy to do so I really appreciate the fact that you've done that thank thanks for talking again together I'll be hopping your straight shooter or I really appreciate that alright okay thank you very much thanks easy
4868,high_085,client,dr. Sheila asked me if I would spend some time with you today
4869,high_085,counsellor,I'm really glad that you here I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me
4870,high_085,client,well I came to see dr. Steele last week because of increasing stress and anxiety that's kind of getting the best of me and in the course of my appointment with him he was asking how I was dealing with that stress and I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent in maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something
4871,high_085,counsellor,yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that
4872,high_085,client,I suppose okay. I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets. Might take a little bit. He told me to fill that out and bring it with me.
4873,high_085,counsellor,okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting typically yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive
4874,high_085,client,wine with my meals um you know again one or two typically and more frequently three or four so my stress is increased
4875,high_085,counsellor,so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that okay okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot
4876,high_085,client,I fill the glass up so maybe a little more than
4877,high_085,counsellor,yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and / in one week so in total how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that mmm so what do you make of all that
4878,high_085,client,well that news to me you know I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy and you know no more than seven in a week that seems kind of prohibitive
4879,high_085,counsellor,yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol
4880,high_085,client,well you know it does at least in the moment temporarily reduce my stress and I you know like a good glass of wine I don't don't drink the cheap stuff I like the expensive what
4881,high_085,counsellor,so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those not so good things about alcohol for you
4882,high_085,client,um well you know the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kind of yuck and of course part of my stress is finances and I mentioned I like the good stuff and so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden yeah
4883,high_085,counsellor,so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking
4884,high_085,client,yeah kind of defeating the purpose there the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses
4885,high_085,counsellor,so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more
4886,high_085,client,maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress
4887,high_085,counsellor,yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele
4888,high_085,client,I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help me you know when I'm feeling overwhelmed and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot
4889,high_085,counsellor,I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of through i below the visual here with that if zero is not important ten is very important to do something about your drinking
4890,high_085,client,way mm-hmm well I mean if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking then it's fairly important maybe about a
4891,high_085,counsellor,mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a or a or
4892,high_085,client,well again I've got to get things under control you know my kids are depending on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress and
4893,high_085,counsellor,so you know all those responsibilities there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale
4894,high_085,client,um well the you know the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction I certainly can't afford to you know have any more stress
4895,high_085,counsellor,yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking
4896,high_085,client,I'm pretty confident and you know probably about a seven or eight
4897,high_085,counsellor,okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit
4898,high_085,client,just in case but you know I like I said like a good glass of wine I don't want to quit altogether I'd be willing to try cutting that but you know if it's going to if doctor seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety and it meant that I had to not drink at all I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time
4899,high_085,counsellor,so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit
4900,high_085,client,well again you know if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress then then you know I be pretty ready I again maybe about in on that scale maybe an eighth okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well
4901,high_085,counsellor,it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress
4902,high_085,client,well I you know the the exercise but again that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now hoping that dr. seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of
4903,high_085,counsellor,one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone that'd be nice right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future all right thank you very much you're welcome
4904,high_086,client,well I did get an interview for a job
4905,high_086,counsellor,that's so great
4906,high_086,client,yeah but I wasn't able to go because my kids I didn't have any one to watch them and you know so that was sort of game over I just I had to cancel the interview and this it's too bad because it was really actually was a job that would have been good but I don't know
4907,high_086,counsellor,sound disappointed
4908,high_086,client,well yeah because it's it's you know I didn't really have a choice I just have to be have to make sure my kids are taken care of first and you know worried that this is going to keep happening
4909,high_086,counsellor,it's going to keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities yeah well tell me honest go from one to ten and how important is it for you to get a job
4910,high_086,client,it's it's about out of ten because yeah I mean I'm the only one supporting my kids and you know it's just I what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it so I really need to have job and soon
4911,high_086,counsellor,yeah you're you're it yep you have to provide for your children and tell me how to skip from one to ten how confident are you that you can get a job
4912,high_086,client,I mean right now I think I'm bad with a three I just seems like you know even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare you know when I show up I've got this resume that it's it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job so I just feel like I'm not I don't know that employable
4913,high_086,counsellor,so it sounds like the childcare issue has been getting in the way into finding something would work for you would be really helpful and then also it sounds like you're kind of feeling not so great about your resume and your experience
4914,high_086,client,yeah yeah because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working I mean it's not I don't know it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now
4915,high_086,counsellor,okay what is it that you want
4916,high_086,client,"I just want something that is going to be steady and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that I can be home every night and spending time with them. And I really like to get something where I'm just making good money and I don't have to worry all the time about money, yeah."
4917,high_086,counsellor,so if you have if you had consistent work it would change your life in a lot of ways yeah it would be huge it would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much
4918,high_086,client,yeah and it'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine right
4919,high_086,counsellor,so everyday you know where you're going yeah okay and you know what's what's happening for the day for the week right
4920,high_086,client,one it would be good if I knew you know that my kids are taking care of yeah so I'm not worried about them law in the work right yeah
4921,high_086,counsellor,because you're you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well great yeah um so tell me what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence to feel a little bit more confident getting work
4922,high_086,client,well I mean being able to make the interviews would be the priority again um so try you know taking care having some child care I mean having someone I trust that I can call when I you know what that interview because you definitely need to go to an interview of in order to get three
4923,high_086,counsellor,yeah yeah so having taken care of that part having some reliable child care
4924,high_086,client,yeah definitely not
4925,high_086,counsellor,what else would get five
4926,high_086,client,um I just wish that I had I had more experience or um you know more education it seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume okay I get asked about education and training and um you know just as soon as I asked about it I just feel just like I'm not good enough okay this does not have that
4927,high_086,counsellor,yeah so if you had something on a resume that was around education training maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in that you would feel proud of yourself yeah well something I could talk about
4928,high_086,client,yeah the interview too you know even if I was some type of certification where I could say I could you know with confidence talk about about that mm-hmm
4929,high_086,counsellor,okay what do you have any ideas as to what feels you might be interested in getting some more education more training
4930,high_086,client,I mean I guess I just don't really know what it's going to be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure like what's going to be fast right I almost feel like that's more importance and what I'm interested in you know because I'm like I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now
4931,high_086,counsellor,okay and so if if you were it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd want to do something really quickly like
4932,high_086,client,yeah short a short certificate yeah or something yes something that I could get immediate skills that would you know get me into some kind of a job now even if it's not my long-term goal or you know career just just get me into something and then I how focused on yeah sort of like a short-term or transition into something else yeah great exactly but that would be steady and pays well mm-hmm okay and allow you to afford everything ya need to because even those jobs right now I don't feel accessible for me they seem like you know seems like if maybe if I were better on the computer or
4933,high_086,counsellor,okay you know specifically getting some computer skills to help
4934,high_086,client,yeah I think so okay I think so because I don't I can't I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about the technology yeah okay
4935,high_086,counsellor,so whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one and then once you're there at the interview feeling more confident about your skills getting some reliable child care certainly sounds very important yeah as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers yeah that would be great okay okay great so what would you like to do next you
4936,high_086,client,think well I'll find the childcare resources is seems to be the batsman's of it that's a priority the priority because I can't even do an interview without that yeah and then I guess getting into some type of some type of a training program that's you know shortly maybe there's a weekend
4937,high_087,client,I'm all right just a little tired today alright well
4938,high_087,counsellor,so what's what's going on
4939,high_087,client,"I'm just sick and tired. I won't have a regular life or normal life like everybody else. It's very, it's just, I'm just so sick of nobody's helping me. I do everything by myself. You know I have all these kids, you know, they running around and you know acting crazy. I'm just, I'm tired of it. But they'd out of my husband, he runs around and do what he do. I was just sick and tired of having to live like this. I thought, you know, as a child when I grow up as an adult life is gonna be so much better, but it's not. It's just like whatever. Well, I don't do what I can to try to make sure my kids have with a"
4940,high_087,counsellor,well so you're doing your best but but pretty pretty disappointed in the way things are for you these nights not seeing a whole lot of its kind of kind it is kind of your life isn't it I mean you guys kids what it is
4941,high_087,client,i mean i have to make sure that i take care of them I'm because who else will I don't have anybody to help me I have no support yeah I have to make sure they get well
4942,high_087,counsellor,for spore small kids and one of them being baby nuts and
4943,high_087,client,she's all over the place I mean she's pulling down stuff and and is how to go behind and pick it up and so now just they forget it just let her throw it down on floor oh my
4944,high_087,counsellor,"Gosh, gets to a point where you pretty much give up."
4945,high_087,client,yeah and I'm just sitting in just watcher and I make sure she doesn't get anything in her mouth
4946,high_087,counsellor,with still having the priority of you know safety you know you're still looking out for her that way but it's kind of gotten you you're getting kind of worn down
4947,high_087,client,yeah I am I am sometime I just feel you know like I don't want to live and I'm like what if I don't I'm not here you know there maybe it'll be better but then I start thinking it can you know gosh these kids are here you know my husband is not doing what he's supposed to do so who's gonna take care of my mom is getting older and I I'll try to tough it out
4948,high_087,counsellor,oh gosh I'm sorry it's getting that point pretty pretty pretty helpless
4949,high_087,client,I am I just try to deal with y'all smell that what we need you in there and it relaxing me. I'm the chilling and you know I'm on cloud nine for a minute. but then I commenter Errol in this deal here.
4950,high_087,counsellor,provides maybe a temporary temporary escape but it never doesn't change anything all right so whatever what are some other things that you're doing that maybe you feel are helpful
4951,high_087,client,well nothing really i like the right and i really do i like to write but I don't write I like to read but I don't really read it much so um you know I try to write and I just don't have time it to get tired and I Spit on the bed and or I was sitting on a chair fall asleep but look at TV and so probably smoking smoking me home I don't really like to drink much but I might I'm gonna change them socially have a dream
4952,high_087,counsellor,well its own so long and so you liked it you like to read and you liked write yeah and and kind of the classic thing that happens right when you when you start to feel depressed when you start to really get depressed that's exactly what happens the things that we really enjoy the things that really fulfill us are the things that we that we start to not do anymore even though it's like even though you know you've always enjoyed it I you just don't feel like doing you just kind of get to a point where you're like just you know it's not like I saw you perk up I mean you talk about it your eyes just lit up you know the way you talk about you like to write and you have a passion there so it sounds like that's something that if you if you were doing that that would be an indication that you're you're doing better you feel good
4953,high_087,client,yeah i think i would but when i have time yeah and that's not a thing I say well maybe I could do it at night when I put the kids to be a nigger but then you know we're getting somewhere I can't die on the paper you know it might be over there my notebook is somewhere else and I just say well you know I may be good tomorrow right
4954,high_087,counsellor,well I and I think we all experience that I mean it's that kind of you know even though it's something you like sometimes it's it does take kind of taught it does take time and it takes energy and when you're tired you know you don't always feel like it and that's part of it too is it that you know i i'm sure the writing in and of itself is a very rewarding thing but then it's in order to write you have to have time to yourself and it sounds like that's something that you sure don't have much
4955,high_087,client,no and you think feels gonna come in here and i'll take the key it so i can write no this is outside playing with motorcycles and cars and you know and probably chasing women I don't know but you know it's just crazy so he's not going to do anything I thought husband supposed to be son Isaac suppose we ate or he'll miss fortune
4956,high_087,counsellor,well I heard you mentioned earlier something about your husband some concerns you're having about the relationship so so maybe just to get a sense of there are a few things going on I mean one is you've got the feet feeling pretty down feeling pretty down feeling pretty overwhelmed with being a home all the time with the kids and not having time for yourself not having a break not being able to get away so one is you don't have the time to get away like you don't have many opportunities when you do you're pretty well exhausted and don't really feel like doing the things that you have enjoyed in the past like reading and writing and then so one of the things you've done to try to cope is is smoking marijuana which you know seems to help for a little bit but then when you come back it's everything's the same and so it seems like you're not getting a tremendous amount out of that and then you've got your husband who you're in this you know you've got real concerns real questions about what's going on with him and you're not feeling entirely supported and and you've got questions about its fidelity alright
4957,high_087,client,that's another story we'll be here all day okay all right well
4958,high_087,counsellor,so out of everything out of all of that I mean what do you think is the thing that how do you think we could best use our time
4959,high_087,client,I just want to be normal that's one of a normal life but I guess just give me just wanting to probably started out looking for a job. I need a job right now so that was probably I didn't really mean it early but that's I needed a job. Okay well it's certainly a star. Oh kind of be a star all right.
4960,high_087,counsellor,so certainly I mean that would influence a lot of the other things and I mean that would hell I'm you'd be getting out of the house and you have money and all those kinds of things any of you thought about kind of like how that would work in terms of taking care of the baby if you had a job you'd be able to maybe someone to help out with the beach
4961,high_087,client,I think well I told my husband that he's gonna have to step up and you know I'll be willing to get a third shift but he's gonna step up and you know take care of the baby throughout the night okay so then when the kids get up for school I'm coming home and he just get them up and with hair and family it's kind of taken alone all right so I have thought about
4962,high_087,counsellor,yeah you got you've got a real plan in mind okay i just got to get out then the four job okay i have all my right of the main everything is ready but I just Evan at a time ok ok thank you
4963,high_088,client,I'm doing all right not doing so bad are you done today
4964,high_088,counsellor,nothing thanks for asking what brings you in
4965,high_088,client,um so my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper and she saw like out of some of the things that you work on one of them is smoking cessation and it bothers her that that I smoke so she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you so I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it
4966,high_088,counsellor,so you came into therapy today because your girlfriend pressured you
4967,high_088,client,yeah I mean it's just it's easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you like that's it I can spend like minutes with you compared to hours of her nagging me through the week so
4968,high_088,counsellor,so you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in
4969,high_088,client,yeah I mean it's covered by insurance it's just minutes of my time but
4970,high_088,counsellor,and what she would like you to do and this is her goal not yours would be to stop smoking
4971,high_088,client,yeah
4972,high_088,counsellor,tell me what your goal is
4973,high_088,client,I mean I don't really have one like I I don't think smoking is that bad well I mean I don't know smoking can be bad but like it doesn't it's never bothered me like I I don't know it's like I really don't have any goals to come in besides just having her cell phone you may
4974,high_088,counsellor,so do you have a goal of quitting smoking
4975,high_088,client,yeah no there's no there's like so many good things about smoking like what really got me into it was I smoked a lot of work because it gives me like one-on-one time with the boss so like the fact that I can get that time with my bosses I make a little bit worth it
4976,high_088,counsellor,can you tell me does some of the other good things possible
4977,high_088,client,um it's just like it's how I meet people so like if I like I'll have cigarettes on me but like I don't have a lighter and that kind of like keeps me from fishing off the pack because I could fish off a pack a day but if I don't have a lighter than like I carry the cigarettes around with me and then if I see other people are smoking I can go and ask for a light and that's always kind of like a way in to get to these groups and like I've just met so many different people from from smoking like
4978,high_088,counsellor,so smoking the way you're presenting it there's been a positive thing in your life
4979,high_088,client,yeah I mean I'm like I want to do it socially so that's yeah
4980,high_088,counsellor,are there any negative aspects to smoking
4981,high_088,client,I mean yeah I mean I one you everyone knows smoking is unhealthy but like I don't I don't smoke a lot like I only only smoke from time to time but it's mostly just on the weekends so it's like I don't know in case you buy smoker for the weekends I might have like a coffee maybe like a heavy a call from Mondays Tuesdays part of me is gone by Wednesday so it's not really that big of a deal
4982,high_088,counsellor,you don't seem like you're too worried about the the negative aspects
4983,high_088,client,no I mean like the obviously is unhealthy but like one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons I think
4984,high_088,counsellor,so let me ask you a question I want you to give a response between - this is called scaling and is to do it the importance of stopping smoking so one would be it's not important to you and 10 would be it's extremely important where do you think you'd put that number
4985,high_088,client,I don't know maybe like like a - like it'd be cool if you order the coffee on Mondays but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from sweating
4986,high_088,counsellor,so not particularly important
4987,high_088,client,yeah
4988,high_088,counsellor,now let me ask you the same question except instead of importance how confident or how about confidence how confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale once to have one being not confident all and ten being extremely confident
4989,high_088,client,I could say probably like an eight or a nine like I could I could give it up actually. I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn't even crave it. But eventually like just seeing all my friends got smoking like I missed that so I just starting up again. But I don't know right like if I really wanted to give it up for good I'm sure I could.
4990,high_088,counsellor,So stopping smoking is not important to you but you're fairly confident you could if you decided you would. So based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking. What would be a goal? How could we spend this time so that it would be productive?
4991,high_088,client,I don't know like I guess who would it would help to be able to like explain to my girlfriend like like the stuff that I get from smoking and like you you seen you kind of seem like you get it so like I don't know maybe you figure out ways to like explains or her the things that I get from smoking to like I don't just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself
4992,high_088,counsellor,so to help her to understand why the smoking works for you yeah that's that's one goal there any other goals you could think of I mean you came in in part because you're well soon here like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured it yeah so any other relational goals so my work on there
4993,high_088,client,I don't know we haven't really been like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking mm-hmm so I think like maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way like I don't understand that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always and like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us living in the house but like I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days it's a
4994,high_088,counsellor,productive communication and productive arguments right yeah yeah so so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend where actually understands how important it is to you yeah because it does seem like it's really important but another would be to work on your relation your relational style so that you you can end argument feel like you're not in a stalemate right
4995,high_088,client,yeah yeah that's gonna be cool all right
4996,high_088,counsellor,well you want to make those the goals that we work one so that we can spend this time yeah I can do it that it's kind of like killing two birds with one stone don't make sense to you hmm well that's what we'll do so wait like you do I'll see you again and about a week right right so if you could reflect on some of these changes do you think you can make with this relationship well you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator because a lot of this revolves around communication oh yeah communicating the advantages of smoking but also communicating in the arguing so that you have to end to these arguments right it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result yeah yeah that would be cool we can do that okay so if you could work on kind of thinking that through and then the next time we meet we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes you know in that relationship to to meet those goals right all right suck it all right thanks for coming in con man thank you
4997,high_089,client,I guess I'm okay how are you
4998,high_089,counsellor,I'm well thanks for asking so you say you're doing okay what's going on
4999,high_089,client,um just definitely no better than last week when we talked I mean it's been I had some major binges this week I don't even honestly know why we're bothering to talk about it because I've been down this road before mm-hmm I should just I should just like give up and buy some muumuus and you know just resigned myself to the fact that i'm going to get that and i'm going to stay at
5000,high_089,counsellor,tell me about some of the foods that you've been eating have been leading to this problem
5001,high_089,client,brownies mm-hmm brownies brownies brownies and well that's what got it started you know I was great the first half of the week and I'm staying away from the sugar away from the flour my son has stayed home from school hurt his head you wanted to bake brownies my son okay let's bake brownies so then we ate the whole pan and we make two more pans and then it didn't just stay the brownies you know went out hamburgers french fries candy you know stopped in wawa the web host its disgusting I can't I don't want to tell you how much because it's just disgusting and clothes aren't fitting it's just really really sad
5002,high_089,counsellor,you've had a rough week
5003,high_089,client,yeah
5004,high_089,counsellor,so let's talk about for a second I'd like to the kind of your relationship to this problem how do you view this problem
5005,high_089,client,it's disgusting it's like a slave food owns me so the
5006,high_089,counsellor,so the food is in control of the situation
5007,high_089,client,sounds ridiculous when you say it like that but that's what it is
5008,high_089,counsellor,it's in control all right so Nate I won't ask you a couple questions about that the importance and the confidence of changing clearly you have some desire to change or you wouldn't be here
5009,high_089,client,oh my god I would love ya
5010,high_089,counsellor,so if you are looking at a scale of one to ten one was it's not important to change and ten was it's extremely important change this is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating * very important to you yeah it's very important okay so what if I asked the same question except this time you're confident so one is you're not confident all you can change but you're very confident could change
5011,high_089,client,I could probably change for half a day mm-hmm. I've done it and sometimes if I'm lucky I'll get a week. But overall overall it's impossible. Like you want a number at zero.
5012,high_089,counsellor,so it's below the blow the scale of one to ten this is yeah so you end of no confidence at all
5013,high_089,client,I've tried it I know I mean it's like beating my head against a wall see you
5014,high_089,counsellor,so on one hand you'd like to you'd like to stop to eating it's important to you the other hand you don't believe you can do it
5015,high_089,client,can't you can't do it I can't it can't be done
5016,high_089,counsellor,have there been any other changes you have been able to make say in the last few years that have been positive
5017,high_089,client,ah stop biting my nails
5018,high_089,counsellor,so you had some small successes in terms of making changes what do you think makes the this I'll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful so much more difficult to tackle
5019,high_089,client,I wish I knew there's so many things it's it's everywhere the food is a root is everywhere
5020,high_089,counsellor,he mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week
5021,high_089,client,brownies hershey bars Hershey kisses yeah chocolate
5022,high_089,counsellor,you enjoy chocolate yeah okay how about other foods it could be contributing the problem that maybe you don't enjoy as much that's chocolate
5023,high_089,client,Oh potato chips french fries Mexican food what else cheese definitely
5024,high_089,counsellor,any of the types of candies
5025,high_089,client,start name and I'm skittles cherry starburst basically any candy
5026,high_089,counsellor,pretty much any candy yeah so of of the candy so I want to focus just on the candies and not there the food is just for now the thought of like I introduced the idea is stopping eating chocolate how it's react to that not gonna happen
5027,high_089,client,that's not gonna happen I would love to write to happen right but that's not I can just tell you I don't even want to pretend so you know that for certain
5028,high_089,counsellor,how about the let's let's go for example with the skills what if I've introduced the idea of stopping the consumption of skills
5029,high_089,client,just candy skittles just just that one candy yeah why bother but like I not eat skittles is that what you're saying like
5030,high_089,counsellor,oh you could it's up to you whether you or not but if i enter just that idea of stopping the consumption of skittles how would you react to that I don't really understand why well it represents a change in the direction that you want to move
5031,high_089,client,but if I stop eating skittles I'm still going to eat brownies I'm still going to eat
5032,high_089,counsellor,but we know we know that's an area that did you know you can't really make a change right now what you're saying like us the idea of stopping chocolate is not going over well with you know it's not gonna happen and that's fine but the idea of stopping skittles that's fine that doesn't seem as daunting no would you agree skittles on save the scale that it's important to stop skills
5033,high_089,client,yeah okay yeah
5034,high_089,counsellor,how confident are you you could not even
5035,high_089,client,it's kind of funny now you're talking about it I've sort of want skittles more but you know I'd like from now until next week when I come in here hmm i'd say like i'm ninety-nine percent confident i could not eat skittles and it would not be a major problem
5036,high_089,counsellor,alright so this is a change that you think you could accomplish even though you're not sure it'll actually contribute to solving a larger problem
5037,high_089,client,we know that that's something that that's an area where you don't really see a changes as likely wiska if I don't eat skittles this week or even for the rest of my life is it gonna solve my problem no but will I do it if that's what you want me to do yeah that's fine
5038,high_089,counsellor,well I would hope it's something that that you would want to do I mean what I want is one thing what you want is really important here is this something that made our skills part of the problem yeah small yeah right no pun intended right in another small but it's a small part problem but your degree still part about
5039,high_089,client,yeah sure so
5040,high_089,counsellor,not a huge change but it's one that we can work on all right I want you to build to you know genuinely buy into the goal I mean if you don't think it's important we can talk about other areas change
5041,high_089,client,no I guess I see what you're saying I mean if I'm going to be completely honest with you I well that's when I paying you for right so I don't think it's gonna work I'll just tell you that what
5042,high_089,counsellor,you think you could stop eating skittles but you don't think it's going to solve the larger problem or lead to exactly all right but that's what we have to work with right now because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control yeah yeah so if I are just the idea of stopping brownies no no no sorry isn't that so let's let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case it's not perfect it's not ideal but it's what you can do fair enough sounds like a plan so so for this week i'll see you again week for this week just just continue eating skills it was skittles all right let's go ahead and let's see let's see how we do with that change does that seem to make sense yeah all right so work with that and I'll see you can we thank you thank you
5043,high_090,client,okay i guess i guess something happened over this past week i I've been looking for a new job since i left my last one and I found I found this really good job on the internet but the problem is that the job is working with kids and they they have to do a drug test in order for me to get the job and it kind of like it made me think is made me think a little bit more about something that I've been considered for a while which is kind of just giving up giving up weed forget like I've been thinking about it for a while but a guy also kind of think about the way the way weed really helps me in like if I'm ever feeling like really really anxious about something um I mean weed kind of as he chill out hub sort of relax and I just don't know if I'm ready to give that up yet
5044,high_090,counsellor,so the marijuana has real value for you but you don't want to see going
5045,high_090,client,yeah yeah it does it's a it's like a way to self-medicate in the way and
5046,high_090,counsellor,at the same time you would like this job
5047,high_090,client,yeah so I could see how this would be a you know pincher right yet I'm just kind of like it's put me in a difficult spot like I definitely I definitely want to get that job but you know if I cut it if I cut out smoking like I don't know what else I would do like if I if I started to have a panic attack or if if I was really like anxious about like anything that I'm worrying about I got all I don't when I did Cubs
5048,high_090,counsellor,have you been treated for anxiety before
5049,high_090,client,um I I did therapy for a little bit but it was like I don't know back then it was kind of like when anxiety was just starting so it wasn't too big of a problem so I like I click there because it was really doing that much yeah
5050,high_090,counsellor,you take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety
5051,high_090,client,I mean like if I'm bored or maybe if I'm like hanging out with buddies like I don't really have a reason not to do it like until now. But it wasn't like like I really use it whenever I like feeling really anxious about something.
5052,high_090,counsellor,so and you may not be able to answer this question but if you didn't have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana
5053,high_090,client,if I didn't have like any kind of anxiety um like it would simply kind of tough to give up because like if I'm hanging out my buddies they offer it to me like that's that's all that's pretty chill but um I don't like I really I'm really looking forward to this job and like the benefits of having that job without weighing the benefits of just like smoking smoking my money's so
5054,high_090,counsellor,so you're excited with the job
5055,high_090,client,I am yeah it's it's almost kind of a dream job
5056,high_090,counsellor,tell me about it
5057,high_090,client,well it's working with its working with kids with autism and the school so look I would be kind of like a almost like a personal ta in a way so like it's a part of an inclusion program so when the kids are going into the class like I would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like help them out in case something comes up and it's like since my brother as autism that's like it's that's something that I've always really kind of wanted to work with
5058,high_090,counsellor,so sounds like a real passion for this type of work and and really the big obstacle here is this marijuana
5059,high_090,client,it is it's like a catch- too because it's like I know the job would be great but it's like it's a it's a big step for me to take that job and it's it's going to be super it's gonna make you super anxious you know it's going to be like it's going to be a lot of anxiety taking a new job so it's like if I have to give up the marijuana and then like not have another way to cope with anxiety like to get the job it's that's a good like a catch-
5060,high_090,counsellor,yeah it's a predicament yeah you're kind of weighing both sides of this right now I'm wondering do you have you think you have like a physical craving for the marijuana
5061,high_090,client,yeah I mean no not really
5062,high_090,counsellor,so you're really using it recreationally and as an anti-anxiety agents
5063,high_090,client,yeah pretty much
5064,high_090,counsellor,so if you were I know you didn't have great success before in therapy we want to combat anxiety but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job which seems like you would really like do you think you would be able to stay away from marijuana
5065,high_090,client,I think if the therapy really worked I would be able to UM like it's just so easy now just to kind of light up like that's an easy fix and like I don't think therapy is gonna be that instead so like you know it it would be tough I think if I had real confidence that the therapy would work I could do it but I mean it would have to it would definitely have to work like I just as well as as smoking you would need to see results yeah yeah definitely
5066,high_090,counsellor,would having the job that you're passionate about reduce your anxiety
5067,high_090,client,after a while like after I got use of the job but like just starting the new job would make me kind of anxious and then like it would be tough not to not to smoke while doing that like I don't I I don't even get why they drug test anymore because like it's it's been decriminalized being legalized in so many places and there's so much research saying it's not that bad it's kind of like it's really upsetting that the place that I really want to work as that policy I think it's really silly
5068,high_090,counsellor,you're frustrated marijuana is illegal yeah it's yeah at the same time it's the reality you're living it right yeah it's I think it will be legalized and like in the state in a couple years but until the end like I mean I can't wait that long to start start working so until then you still need to address this dilemma
5069,high_090,client,right yeah these soil problem
5070,high_090,counsellor,so you have choices here right you can continue to use marijuana and take the job right and that seems like something that has some advantages for you but some some disadvantages right because you would really like that job
5071,high_090,client,yeah and i was it's it sound sympathetic to be like no I don't want to take my dream job because I need weed like such it was stupid
5072,high_090,counsellor,so what do you think you are in terms of making this change you feel motivated to take some steps toward it
5073,high_090,client,I don't like I'm I'm so kind of on the fence because like if I if I have to give it up for the job I could do that but I would definitely need like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety like whether it's therapy or whether it's like something else I yeah I would I would definitely need like a substitute if I got rid of it for good
5074,high_090,counsellor,so you definitely say you definitely need it so you can't give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety right that's that's key to you to make this change yeah but at the same time that would be ideal because then you could take the job
5075,high_090,client,right yeah I mean I mean if I really thought that I could like it's some kind of treatment that was as good as weed yeah I mean I could i get them maybe quit and especially the house to get this job especially
5076,high_090,counsellor,so with anxiety reduction your chances of stopping marijuana increase and then you could take the child that you want yeah yeah I've been notably the best best outcome is that the outcome you would most want
5077,high_090,client,yeah i think so i think i could give up wrecker like doing it my buddies recreationally I could yeah I'm just light up a cigarette
5078,high_090,counsellor,so here's what I'm thinking and let me know what you think about this when you come back next week right what if we start looking at this anxiety if we start you know I start treating this anxiety you know I see if we can get it reduced and kind of work from there because maybe when you start to feel if that works and that anxiety starts to abate it sounds like it'll just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage yeah what kind of time frame are you on terms of taking this job
5079,high_090,client,I mean the job it has a high turnover rate so like even if I like I need to apply this week but if I don't get in more likely another position like it will open up like within a month or two
5080,high_090,counsellor,and when would they drug test you
5081,high_090,client,um it would be like a right after I apply so if I applied and then did the interview that's when they will give him the paperwork and I have to give you a drug test when was the last time you spend more on just a couple days ago to
5082,high_090,counsellor,see what I'm getting at
5083,high_090,client,yeah yeah it's a yeah so I like I wouldn't be able to do I wouldn't be able to make it this application but I would like to be off it by the next one
5084,high_090,counsellor,so you're fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high right because it gives you opportunity to apply later on so do you feel like you could invest in that plan let's work on the anxiety see what happens with marijuana see if we can reduce your usage of it or have you stopped that all together and then kind of move toward this job
5085,high_090,client,yeah yeah I could deal with that
5086,high_090,counsellor,alright so the next time you come in we'll start talking about the anxiety and let's see what we can do about that move from there all right yeah it sounds good that's good thanks Scott thank you
5087,high_091,client,well my doctor made me come said of my diet is bad and my cholesterol level is up so high that I've got to change the way I eat and honestly I don't really feel like doing that so he said I had to come talk to you and hopes that that's going to help
5088,high_091,counsellor,ok so what's nothing to me is that your doctor saying you have an issue a health issue at your cholesterol and nearly an allison issue of this present time cycle
5089,high_091,client,right right it was actually I feel pretty good they do a test on me and says mom not healthy because what I eat them I don't know it doesn't bother me
5090,high_091,counsellor,ok so you sound a little we're very resistant to change
5091,high_091,client,I like french fries I like fast food I don't want of time to cook you know this is the food I eat his burgers it's what's my lifestyle and he says I got to stop eating french fries sometimes pizza I like sausage and a breakfast I eat almost the whole pound of bacon log bacon bacon on my eggs bacon on the sandwiches I like bacon on the cheeseburgers the doctors like mr. Hendricks you have to stop eating bacon wait a minute I don't know about that french fries
5092,high_091,counsellor,so this is the first time you went to the doctor he makes an account with your high cholesterol okay so how long
5093,high_091,client,it's been going on for a while I mean every time he was like yeah I think you how to change the way ye na ma alright and then I keep eating it the this time he's dropped the heavy on me and he said you're gonna have to do this and he showed me pictures of cholesterol problems and told me facts and stories about people that's didn't stop eating the bad foods and cholesterol levels where they ended up not so I don't want to die
5094,high_091,counsellor,okay so what do you think to do to help resolve the issue
5095,high_091,client,I'm kind of hoping some other options I'm changing my food
5096,high_091,counsellor,have you considered exercise
5097,high_091,client,we didn't talk so much about that he was so focused on the food but I'd be willing to exercise if I can still eat my fries
5098,high_091,counsellor,"Okay, will sound like you have it this semester issue the food thing. You are not great to give up but exercising to be a possible Avenue just to lower your cholesterol levels. Ok, so how motivated are you today start like a rigorous exercise routine?"
5099,high_091,client,the lord I kept glycerol was six maybe a seven even okay
5100,high_091,counsellor,so what could you do this week to start now once you've in this office today to have lower your cholesterol
5101,high_091,client,follow the hunger but how odd probably willing to talk to somebody about an exercise program
5102,high_091,counsellor,okay have you know participant in an exercise program before
5103,high_091,client,no
5104,high_091,counsellor,okay knows me a lot of work and I respect your decision that you are not ready to give the food but you have a decision to make good choices it is your choice to do with you is it D but this is too much for you like you're incapable of this this is beyond you you can now show your dad
5105,high_091,client,I can do it but I don't know if I'd be happy
5106,high_091,counsellor,so how would you know if you're not happy until you try it
5107,high_091,client,I got a feeling I wouldn't be happy but I'm wrong
5108,high_091,counsellor,okay so you say motivated like a or a mm is that the highest like today that you've been or wish your motivation
5109,high_091,client,I'm lowering operators after my last doctor appointment
5110,high_091,counsellor,okay it is promised been going on for how many watts or
5111,high_091,client,yeah probably three to four years three or four years okay he's noticed it's been a while since my cholesterol hasn't started to come down
5112,high_091,counsellor,okay so this is like neglect for the three or four years pretty much but you are little motivated now
5113,high_091,client,yeah he scared me all about with the health reports he was giving me
5114,high_091,counsellor,okay when's next time you go to the doctor
5115,high_091,client,he wants me back in a month
5116,high_091,counsellor,okay so cuz you're a little motivated he said I'm six or seven we can maybe establish a pan for you so we listen good a doctor your clothes will be lower than what it was just this present month that'd be good sorry the plan sorry your plan
5117,high_092,client,doing good doing good just you know work the kitty stroll last night tricks um then I saw my man one of these other girls were skimming off the top and he beat her up good and I i just decided come in here cuz you know the money wasn't so good last night but a lot better than working for mcdonalds right
5118,high_092,counsellor,yeah so you you saw your without your boyfriend beating up another girl
5119,high_092,client,yeah my man was beating up another girl she works for him too okay
5120,high_092,counsellor,so what what do you think happened there
5121,high_092,client,right she was just stupid she was skimming off the top and you know at least be smart about it charges the john like a couple extra dollars and do it that way but she was like doing it based regular price and she got caught she didn't meet her quota
5122,high_092,counsellor,okay so how do you feel about that how how do you feel about he'll be up and in front of you
5123,high_092,client,oh I mean he gotta do what he gotta do but I it was it was weird because it was right in front of me and these other girls and he beat her up really badly like even more than just like like a couple dollars was worth as if like she been doing it for a long time but I don't think so cuz he would have been in there up Oh like when it started just saw it i mean her face is pretty messed up so she got their ass tonight
5124,high_092,counsellor,so it sounds like it affected you to witness stuff
5125,high_092,client,yeah yeah i guess so i mean it's it's scary know like your you're just out there and you're working and he's supposed to protect you because I mean we got the dual system kind of like me and this other girl we make sure we check in oh but I mean we can still get attacked by johns and stuff like it's it's like a part of the job I mean we make pretty good money but working on the kitty stroll would word like we have to take care of each other and then he's supposed to take care of us so when he reprimands this is kind of like it's just another thing no it's another like like he could just told her not to do it again but i don't know i mean he's running a business whatever it's his business but it's just scary just just thinking about it like he could have done that to me and maybe i would have even gotten worse
5126,high_092,counsellor,wow so you afraid that he might do that to you and you you kind of view him viewed him in the past or until last night as a protector so you afraid that he might do that to you also
5127,high_092,client,I mean it's not like it's not like I haven't seen him beat up other girls I mean but usually it's not that bad you know it's like host maxim went down poncho anything like that but then he was really beating her up to a point where like like her whole face was swollen purple black I don't know but I mean it's not like she was the first one ever like skim off the top but I guess she got Kai
5128,high_092,counsellor,so he's getting out of control he's getting out of control
5129,high_092,client,I think so if I mean it never saw him like that before and I mean I don't want to be receiving and you know am I not pretty faith then that mean I can't work
5130,high_092,counsellor,so you are afraid for your life you're afraid that he might do it to you sooner than later
5131,high_092,client,yeah I'm definitely scared about that happening um I just don't know what to do i mean i can't i can't make the same money on a regular part-time full-time job you know like i can make easily five hundred dollars a night at the control then to be like making nine dollars an hour whatever minimum wage is at i don't know a store doing merchandise or whatever also we selling stuff but i won't be making good enough money
5132,high_092,counsellor,ok so I'm so what I'm hearing is that you you are starting to be afraid of your man yeah and you are tired of witnessing all this abuse happening and you would like to to try something else maybe work out a store but you're not sure if the money will be enough because you're not used to making you know just minimum wage and you are you're not sure you're not sure if you want to leave that life but you are afraid you're afraid for yourself
5133,high_092,client,yeah and I even dropped our high school because you know what am i what am I going to do with books and stuff when I'm making a night at most unless it was a slow night but soul night or whatever just like what what we need college for what do I need school for I don't need a diploma I mean I mean not even that's mine so why am I going with my time because as time goes on like we grow older we like lose our beauty and everything so I might as well just use whatever I can out fucking school I guess i'll go later whatever else or even need it but i don't i don't want to be like wasting my time I got a job that I'm not gonna like I mean not that like this one but at least it's like let's work for more money ok so
5134,high_092,counsellor,it's important to you that you make a certain amount of money to support yourself
5135,high_092,client,yeah okay sure I don't want to like have to like worry about Oh am I gonna pay my phone bill or oh I like that purse but I can't afford it I want that I want to make good money now ok but then again like getting her Oh sometimes raped it's just just too much
5136,high_092,counsellor,so it's so on one hand it's it's important to you that you have nice things that you make a certain amount of money but then the other you don't want to continue risking your life this ways that that's what I'm hearing that you don't want to continue with this lifestyle you feel like it's getting out of hand as far as the violence
5137,high_092,client,"I mean this is only like I've been working since I was so this is only thing that I know. I don't know how to do anything else. Flip burgers, whatever, you know. I buy McDonald's, I don't sell McDonald's."
5138,high_092,counsellor,ok so it's it's it seems like you you would like to do something different but it is a particular type of job you would like to do and the type of money you would like to make
5139,high_092,client,and but but I mean what kind of job is that makes us good money there's not that many jobs and not that many jobs I mean right there so it's like like I don't know it's just
5140,high_092,counsellor,so you feel like you're not you're not smart enough good enough to try something different
5141,high_092,client,yeah I don't feel smart enough to do that to like change like what I've been doing this is all I know so it's it's all I can do I mean I wish I could do something else but what can I do I mean what's the references I'm gonna do oh I've been doing from this to this you know working the streets no one's gonna hire me no no one's going to give me like a chance no one's gonna go oh she dropped out of high school and and then start working the streets let's give her a job
5142,high_092,counsellor,yeah so you would like to try something different you would like to maybe try a different type of work but you're afraid that people will not give you a chance and they will judge you based on on the fact that you dropped out of high school and you've been working the streets and so you're afraid that maybe people will not see that you you are smart and and you want things in life and coming in here and speaking about it is a good thing you know and no and understanding that maybe I can try something different is a good thing you know it's it's it takes courage and and you afraid that people will not see that in you
5143,high_092,client,yeah ah I just want them you know what I just want to be able to be doing what I do without fear though cuz I don't mind like I don't care what I do I'm whatever about it I mean this someone has to do it you know if we had like no prostitution I don't think was like I don't think politicians we get their rocks off ah but yeah like I wouldn't mind doing what I'm doing but I don't want like that the things that that happened to girls all the time I don't want to get breathe in I don't want get a choked or whatever okay
5144,high_092,counsellor,so you would you would rather a safe place that you don't mind what you're doing but you you you you would like for it to be a little safer for you and
5145,high_092,client,yeah but that's that's like that's like utopia want wanting something or whatever that is whatever utopia is it's like peace or something I had wanted John talking about it I was like what no crime so use
5146,high_092,counsellor,these things like you you know you you want you you don't mind the job in one way but you afraid for your life and you also want to try something different like you want to do to show the world that you can you know you can do other things and you you know even though you dropped out of high school you can have another job but at the same time having a certain type of the money making a certain type of money is important to you and having nice things on point
5147,high_092,client,I mean I can't go into college without like a GED or anything like that so I don't know. I mean cause you spent like is expensive so now we have like a place I'm living at right now. I live with my man okay so do some most like the other girls too. We can't put like we can't be applying for college applications and then having mail go to the house. That would be weird I think. I think I might get beaten up for that.
5148,high_092,counsellor,okay so you can't you can't do anything as far as for yourself like you can't apply for school i'm leaving there
5149,high_092,client,no no if if he thinks that we're going to be leaving I think I'll get worse than beating up I think might get killed okay
5150,high_092,counsellor,so you would write you would you would like to apply for college but you afraid that you might get killed if your man finds out that you are applying for college so it seems like it means something to you that you you continue your education
5151,high_092,client,yeah I mean there's only so many options for me to do and that the only option right now seems like I gotta keep working the streets cuz I don't got a house I don't you know have anything that belongs to me like it like per se I mean I guess everything's like all the girls we share like everything all the clothes um yeah we we sometimes sleep in the same room okay but we're in the same house and I don't know like I don't think I can afford moving out by myself okay
5152,high_092,counsellor,so one day you would like to move out but you don't think it can work out right now as far as your living situation
5153,high_092,client,I mean I don't think I got many options and I don't I don't see the opportunities like around I mean like if you if you think about it I'm I'm stuck maybe if I was like back at if someone stopped it from happening then maybe I've had a chance but no
5154,high_092,counsellor,okay okay so what I'm hearing is that you know you would like to try something different you would like to go to college but you are afraid to even apply for to go to college because you don't want your man to find out you feel like you can do something better with your life but the opportunities are not you don't feel like the opportunities are there for you right now but glad that you are you know you come here and you talk about it it's encouraging and it'd take a lot of you know stress to do that I thank you for coming today we will resume next week thank you for coming it takes a lot of courage thank you thank you
5155,high_093,client,well doc I know you told me that I need to lose weight and even though the scale didn't show today I was able to lose about pounds but then I gained it right back
5156,high_093,counsellor,well I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront do you mind if we explore this issue further
5157,high_093,client,no by all means I know we have to discuss it all right
5158,high_093,counsellor,well it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently and I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have to come back again so tell me what you did to lose that initial pounds
5159,high_093,client,I started watching what I ate. I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking. I'm walking up to minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off and I felt better. But then I watched it come back on again. I gave up.
5160,high_093,counsellor,but you did have some success tell me how you felt when you lost the weight
5161,high_093,client,I felt great I felt really proud of myself I thought that this was something that I could do okay
5162,high_093,counsellor,well it sounds like you realize that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's going to affect your overall health so tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back well
5163,high_093,client,I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables that's it
5164,high_093,counsellor,and how many servings are fruits and vegetables on average per day would you
5165,high_093,client,have to be honest I have four five forty six glass of orange juice a day I have fruit for lunch and breakfast I have usually one to two servings of a vegetable my close your broccoli with thinner
5166,high_093,counsellor,John is very important that you recognize that some fruits but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?
5167,high_093,client,no I didn't know umm but doesn't the food pyramid classify fruit juice as a serving
5168,high_093,counsellor,you're absolutely right but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only when it comes to nutrition we have to have a more personalized approach so I have a hunch and that is the excess fruit that you are consuming probably caused your weight rebound what's your impression
5169,high_093,client,well this changes quite a bit I mean here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter indeed
5170,high_093,counsellor,let me ask you something knowing what you know now how important is it to to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking
5171,high_093,client,it obviously I need to cut back on the fruit juice but boy do I love that OJ oh
5172,high_093,counsellor,I understand let me ask you this on a scale from zero to ten zero mean that there's no way you can do it and ten meaning that you're % confidence that you can do it how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking
5173,high_093,client,in six or seven
5174,high_093,counsellor,all right so you're not a zero so that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable this is something you certainly can do why are you not a zero
5175,high_093,client,I guess is because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight
5176,high_093,counsellor,so you realize again that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in you're going to decrease your weight you're going to feel better and you're going to impact your health positively
5177,high_093,client,yes
5178,high_093,counsellor,but you're also not a ten and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a ten or even an eight or nine
5179,high_093,client,getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it my wife does the shopping for us so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice that would solve it
5180,high_093,counsellor,"okay now if the juice was still there can you think of anything else you could do I suppose I could replace it with low-calorie drink or drink more water excellent John I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction and the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?"
5181,high_093,client,I'd say I didn't have any I substituted it with sugar free drinks
5182,high_093,counsellor,excellent well it sounds like you have a plan same scale zero to ten how confident are you that you can make this happen okay I agree all right well you know what I'm not going to start any medications today your labs were a little bit off but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint what do you think great sounds good to me excellent I'll see you in two weeks you
5183,high_094,client,oh I'm just not feeling well I just feel dizzy a lot mm-hmm well
5184,high_094,counsellor,I noticed from your previous physical exam couple days ago that your blood pressure seems to be a little bit high. It was around over. I was wondering how you are managing this blood pressure. Or are you aware of your hypertension?
5185,high_094,client,yeah I'm aware that I have hypertension but I don't really measure my blood pressure every day but now that what that you mentioned what my blood pressure is I do have concerns
5186,high_094,counsellor,okay well thank you for seeing me today I understand that you have concerns about your blood pressure can you please tell me more about it
5187,high_094,client,well to tell you the truth I'm not really taking my water pills every day because it makes me pee a lot and I don't like it and nobody told me about the side effects of this medication that's why I don't like taking it I'm not really sure if it's making my blood pressure better because I don't feel any difference also sometimes I forget to take my medication since I live by myself and nobody is there to remind me I really want to manage my blood pressure I know I can do it but I just need help
5188,high_094,counsellor,okay it seems to me that you're really concerned about your blood pressure and that you are willing to change if I'm understanding this correctly you are not aware of any side effects of your medication and your water pill makes you go to the washroom a lot which makes you not want to take your medication even more also you mentioned that you are living alone and so you tend to forget your pills and you would want some help to remember that is this correct
5189,high_094,client,yeah that's correct okay
5190,high_094,counsellor,well thank you for sharing this information with me and for your honesty since both of us are aware that this is an issue would it be okay to talk about your hypertension and what it means to you yeah okay to start would you mind describing some at disadvantages of your hypertension so that we can see you may have
5191,high_094,client,well first of all all I know that hypertension is when you're have a really high blood pressure and it can lead to me suffering a stroke or heart attack and cause that the doctor prescribed me this may six to manage my hypertension but I have no idea how it works and what can be the possible side effects of this medication it's also a challenge to maintain a healthy diet because I live alone and I can't go to go grocery shopping and cook for myself because it's tiring to cook for yourself and i'm already years old and i'm having difficulty finding motivation to exercise but the most challenging part of having hypertension is not being able to take the medications every day consistently I know what I have to do I just need someone to help you learn how to do it
5192,high_094,counsellor,okay well I just shut down some of the concerns that you mentioned just so super clear that we have it here and it seems to me that your biggest concern is your medication adherence and that is pretty much affecting like your daily activities such as going to get exercise or preparing a meal is this right yeah that's right okay now that we've identified some of the challenges we cannot can we please identify some of the advantages of you take your medication properly
5193,high_094,client,well the advantage is that this medication can help me manage my blood pressure since you've informed me that my current blood pressure right now is over and I'm aware that that is high and I can still live a normal life such as play with my grandkids and being able to exercise without experiencing any headaches or dizziness I'm able to prevent myself from developing a stroke so basically more chances of me living longer and healthy
5194,high_094,counsellor,okay that's awesome um when it comes to the importance of you taking your medication on a scale from 0 to 10 being unimportant to the most important how important is it to you for you to take this medication
5195,high_094,client,well it's very important to me so it's a out of because I really want to manage my blood pressure every day and I want to live a healthier life
5196,high_094,counsellor,"Now that this issue is very important to you, I would like to know how confident you are in achieving this goal. So again, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being unconfident and 10 the most confident, how confident are you that you are able to take your medication regularly?"
5197,high_094,client,well I would say about a vibe of because it's difficult for me to take this medication because of the side effects that I always experience with it
5198,high_094,counsellor,ok what would it take for you to go from an  or above or even a  out of  for your confidence
5199,high_094,client,may be constant follow up and support support from family regarding managing my hypertension to help me adhere with my medications regularly
5200,high_094,counsellor,ok thank you for that let me see if I'm understanding this correctly you're aware that you have hypertension and you truly want to manage your blood pressure but you're unable to do so because there are certain challenges that you face such as you can diet for getting your pills regularly not being able to monitor your blood pressure but this leads you to not seeing the full effect of the medication itself however you are so confident that you're able to change by let's say going to a followup with me or having support from your families or friends am I
5201,high_094,client,yeah that's right you mentioned all the information I discussed
5202,high_094,counsellor,ok it seems like you are willing to change your behavior and at the same time you are frustrated about not getting the medication that you need for you to change or support that you need to change am I is a spread
5203,high_094,client,yeah that's right it's frustrating not getting enough support but after talking with you I feel more relieved that I can get the support than I need it
5204,high_094,counsellor,ok do you have any ideas on how to achieve this goal
5205,high_094,client,may be changing the type of medications I'm taking right now because I don't like living with the side effects of it ok and getting more information regarding about the side effects of this lasix and how it's affecting my body and maybe by pill containers to track of my everyday medication so I don't miss any dosage also I should learn how to monitor my blood pressure using the machines to make sure the medication is working well ok and maybe i will go to a clinic near my area to monitor my blood pressure ok
5206,high_094,counsellor,um I'm wondering if you are able to or you'll be open to your monitoring your blood pressure for the safe and next couple of months um just monitoring and see if that side effects are there or if it's working for you this way we can evaluate whether the medication is right for you this time this is ok
5207,high_094,client,you know that's fine and I also want to have a personal diary to monitor my blood pressure regularly oh that's what's like a great plan that can actually work
5208,high_094,counsellor,if you want I can give you some information about like new medications and if you have any questions don't hesitate to give me a call also for the next appointment that we're going to have if you can bring your your diary where you write your blood pressure down we can see and track down how is the medication is for you is there anything else I can do for you
5209,high_094,client,no that's all I feel more relieved now that I talk to you I'm looking forward to our meeting next week okay well thank you so much for openness and honesty i hope this speaker will be better for you and I will see you in a next appointment
5210,high_095,client,dr. Pham already made me get a nutritionist I know what you're going to tell me so Kyle Eve okay okay that's fine
5211,high_095,counsellor,I'm glad you had the opportunity to talk with the nutritionist. I'm sure she's a very nice lady and she has some very valuable information. Do you mind telling me some of the things that she discussed with you?
5212,high_095,client,it's the same stuff you're gonna tell me
5213,high_095,counsellor,okay well I will show you what I normally go through with my patients and then you can let me know if there's any information that you covered with the nutritionist or any of the material it's new to you then that would be great as well basically we feel that going over the nutrition aspect of diabetes and pre-diabetes is so important there's so much that we can do without taking medications and we've seen many patients that have benefited from making just minor changes to their diet that are greatly impacted their health in a very positive way so to start off I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what you eat to get a better picture of your diet so first what did you have for breakfast
5214,high_095,client,couple eggs bacon biscuits great okay all right
5215,high_095,counsellor,and then what about lunch
5216,high_095,client,turkey sandwiches and chips okay chips
5217,high_095,counsellor,and then for dinner
5218,high_095,client,spaghetti salad bread
5219,high_095,counsellor,okay spaghetti salad and bread okay so tell me then what about any snacking that you do throughout the day like any snacks or anything like that
5220,high_095,client,"I don't really snack but sometimes ice cream after dinner. It may be free in between meals. Benign occasion, not very often."
5221,high_095,counsellor,okay and also what kind of beverages and things that you drink what are some of the things that you drink throughout
5222,high_095,client,Throughout the day I constantly feel hydrated. I'm thirsty so I drink sweet tea all day long.
5223,high_095,counsellor,okay okay well thanks for sharing a bit of information within this patient this kind of gives us a better idea of what you throughout the day so now I'm going to give you some information or show you some information about nutrition okay
5224,high_095,client,all right know what you're going to say I need to eat less I've heard it all before it doesn't work for me so good
5225,high_095,counsellor,okay all right so that's that's that's my ministrations but just just kind of bear with me so when I gather from your best far as that you know already you're fully aware of the things that you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself however you seem to find it difficult and you don't think that it works for you is that that's kind of the fish that I'm getting so explain to me what are some of the barriers that you feel exists that prevents you from eating healthier and losing weight
5226,high_095,client,it's mostly the money it's expensive to buy foods that are healthy and I just can't afford it consistently also like foods it tastes good I hope these stuff doesn't taste good and I just don't want it and also my kids want the good taste in food so they wouldn't even eat it if I made healthy food okay
5227,high_095,counsellor,okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine
5228,high_095,client,honestly I only have one I haven't exercised in years just don't feel like it put all the money to join again okay okay and then
5229,high_095,counsellor,what are some of the barriers you believe that prevent you from exercising on a regular basis
5230,high_095,client,well kids they take a lot of time group and money like I said gym memberships or there's several close to my home but they're too expensive for me to get and I just don't have enough time the kids take a ball a day of the day and then work
5231,high_095,counsellor,all right and then what what ultimate benefits let's talk about benefits what benefits that you feel that you can ultimately gain by by seeking out more nutritious foods and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen regimen and an overall losing weight what do you think would be the benefits of doing all that
5232,high_095,client,I guess it's good for you Dr. Pham always gets mad at me and says I'm not healthy and always talks about my weight
5233,high_095,counsellor,okay maybe okay maybe yes yes ma'am well and and then those things are exactly correct on what I would like to do miss Fisher I know that you're pressed for time I'm not going to take too much of your time but I would like to schedule min and I and basically sit down with you and kind of go over some some helpful alternatives and basically look at some cost effective type thing since cost is an issue with you and then also look at some resources that we can channel into when it comes to exercise you'll soon find out that some of the exercises that you can do they don't even require a gym membership so you know if that's something deal at because you mentioned to me that time and money are contouring for you so we basically want to work with you together to see if we can get something that that better suits you you know and get you on the right track when it comes to your pre-diabetes and overall losing weight so would you like to come in and scheduling Pullman with us about a week from now
5234,high_095,client,yeah I mean you can help me with the finances and Ty
5235,high_095,counsellor,yes ma'am yes ma'am I believe that so what what we do is we'll schedule a week from now and but it was it was a pleasure talking with you and I very much look forward to working with you okay all right yeah we good rest of the day okay all right
5236,high_096,client,think I was that's about years years okay okay
5237,high_096,counsellor,and in those years had you ever trying to quit
5238,high_096,client,yeah I tried once when I was pregnant but it just didn't work okay I know I hear it's not worth even the time to be honest
5239,high_096,counsellor,okay well that's fine I mean what you definitely deserve some applause for you know your willingness to quit in it as you know smoking is a very difficult habit to quit especially for a time I paid like years so what were your reasons behind wanting to quit in those previous tips
5240,high_096,client,really is one one main time and is right for it right when I got pregnant the doctor kept nagging me my mom kept nagging me they just kept saying how bad it was for my baby and finally I just got tired of fighting the battle and I quit
5241,high_096,counsellor,okay okay then and then what did your physician tell you about more of the specific dangers in continuing to smoke
5242,high_096,client,he really didn't say anything just that it was bad
5243,high_096,counsellor,he just said it was bad okay so if I understand you correctly miss Fisher on you saying that you have been smoking for years with several attempts to quit in the past but ultimately no long-term success okay both your mother and other family members along with your physician have told you several times on that you need to quit but neither of those individuals everyone into the overall specifics about the actual dangers of wanting to quit smoking is that does that sound about right yeah pretty much okay okay so let's kind of take it one step forward um and those are tips to quit in the past what was it that you know made you start back smoking again
5244,high_096,client,well I needed it to get through the day it calms my nerves I crave it I want a few of kids but they're stressful stressful and I just can't make it without one
5245,high_096,counsellor,okay okay then well that's that's quite all right in this fish I mean we have we have a multitude of patients that mentioned those particular reasons specifically right there also you know as you know I mean but I would say that we've had also great successes working with those patients and ultimately getting them to quit smoking so there's there isn't any lost hope with that so let's let's move into talking about your reasons for wanting to quit should you should you desire to do so what will be those reasons for wanting to quit if you decide to do so
5246,high_096,client,I still think it's a lost cause but I'm not sure. I guess something on TV it says it's back to health. My doctor said is bad for my health. My mom says it's bad for my health. So I guess it's bad for my health. I've smoked for so long I don't notice anything. To me it's what gets me through my day.
5247,high_096,counsellor,okay then get you through the day okay well well tell me this what was the longest period of time that you were able to quit in the past you know since you mentioned the previous quit attempts
5248,high_096,client,guess the pregnancy so about nine months or so I started back pretty much day one after my baby's born
5249,high_096,counsellor,okay why are you able to quit for nine months that's it that's it that's a pretty big accomplishment miss Fisher if you think about it that's pretty much close to in close to an entire year you know do you does that make sense that that's a pretty long period of time you know one whole year why don't you
5250,high_096,client,definitely think about it
5251,high_096,counsellor,okay I mean and I can and I believe it's safe to say that was a pretty tough decision considering the fact that you've been smoking for years right one okay and so basically the fact that you are willing to take it upon yourself in the meantime to quit while you're pregnant that speaks volumes of you you know so that would that would basically lead into my next question you on what would have been the worst thing that could have happened to you if you had quit me smoke if you have started to quit smoking for good after your pregnancy
5252,high_096,client,yes there's nothing bad
5253,high_096,counsellor,nothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important
5254,high_096,client,five okay well well
5255,high_096,counsellor,why a five and not a three or four
5256,high_096,client,"I guess you pointed out I did it for nine months cold turkey so maybe I could do it again for longer this time for my health. They're not for my babies, okay."
5257,high_096,counsellor,alright that's it and that's a great point that you bring out to me miss Fisher on I believe this gives us some some great foundation you know should we decide to move forward with this to with the smoking cessation if it's okay with you I would really like to schedule another interview with you or another point we can actually sit down and go into further detail about about these other barriers that people face on there when they're smoking and also share with you some of the great benefits that that can come of quitting smoking on would that be something that you would be interested in yeah okay well that would be great I mean I would like to thank you again for coming by and we can schedule you an appointment for advocate I was saying about one week does that work for you yeah time free okay and in the meantime I like to come and hand you this tobacco log right here this isn't it this isn't an attempt to help you quit rather it would help us identify some specific triggers and identify triggers that you may face along the road to quitting smoking okay well thank you very much and you have a good rest of the day okay nice meeting
5258,high_097,client,well it's not really that big of a deal it's just on the weekends i have a couple of beers and i think the main thing was the homecoming when I just got a little scared because I didn't remember parts of that night so and like my friend they threw up so it was kind of scary
5259,high_097,counsellor,okay so just to clarify so it sounds like when the one hand you know you kind of drink to fit in at your friends I'll do it that you felt kind of would help feel a little bit more comfortable in this date but on the other hand just being afraid of some of the consequences and seeing friends get sick or kind of a negative for that well well I am concerned about your drinking you know just so you know we used to think that people's brains were done developing by the time you were but now we know that they develop well into your s and alcohol really can have an effect on developing brain cells probably that time where you didn't remember everything you did that night we call that a blackout and that's usually an indication that there's some subtle effects of the alcohol in your brain cells so so again that that's concerning not to mention that often people do things that they later regret when they're drinking so so just to think about all that and really I would recommend that you not drink at all until you turn okay so I mean just to think about that but if I had to have you put on a scale of to being not at all interested being very interested where do you think you'd be as far as your interest in stopping drinking right now
5260,high_097,client,that sounds like a good idea probably like nine or
5261,high_097,counsellor,okay good so now I just want to talk also about driving with the friend who was smoking marijuana yeah I mean just to make sure you understand it a lot of times people may seem fine but really they're not especially with the the skills you need to drive safely so so that's something that you one to avoid here
5262,high_097,client,I'll just call my parents next time I need a run
5263,high_097,counsellor,okay yeah i think you know I've known your parents for a long time and I think they'd be understanding and willing to do what they need to do to come get you so good okay what do you have any questions no I think that's good okay so what I want to do is have you come back in a couple months and just check in to see how you're doing with with not drinking so let's see how that goes and you'll come back in a couple months and we'll we'll see how that way okay so good
5264,high_098,client,sure um as you know i'm andrea i am a junior i'm in the marching band i plated center sacks honey yeah i'm also in the little bit of a band geek i play you know the wind ensemble and the Jazz Band things like that
5265,high_098,counsellor,wow you really are involved in music yeah when did you start
5266,high_098,client,I started playing about years ago actually. Wow yeah I start on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet. Finally found the tenor sax. Hmm yeah.
5267,high_098,counsellor,very cool I've always wanted to be good at music it all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun
5268,high_098,client,um you know just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach things like that it's kind of everyday sort of day okay
5269,high_098,counsellor,tell me a little bit about your family uh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog cute what kind of dogs the golden retriever oh nice okay big boy very fun alright and how are things going in school for you
5270,high_098,client,I'm pretty good grades have been pretty alright I still like three point seven ish okay
5271,high_098,counsellor,great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school
5272,high_098,client,I'd like to you know I'd like to of course graduate high school hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school or I mean that might not happen and then I'd like to go on become a doctor study psychology you need to come at psychiatrist or something okay you
5273,high_098,counsellor,have some pretty big dreams yeah it's great that's really exciting to think about that and you're going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life
5274,high_098,client,um I think a sense of community and belonging okay I think those two and um respect
5275,high_098,counsellor,Respect okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three
5276,high_098,client,yeah well I think community and belonging I kind of related them um you know how I said I was in the marching men I really you know I really enjoyed being in like that team setting of you know being with other people and all working to work together towards that one goal mm-hmm and then in terms of respect I I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules like I I really do think respect is important to respect myself or respect those around me so okay I place great importance in that
5277,high_098,counsellor,okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose in the way and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing and not just authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends
5278,high_098,client,um sometimes you just you know go to the movies go to the beach like I had said sometimes we just get together someone's house play some board games and hang out mm-hmm and
5279,high_098,counsellor,when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved
5280,high_098,client,yeah sometimes
5281,high_098,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and getting loosened up as they say mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking
5282,high_098,client,I'd say um on a not busy month for instance i'd say about like two weekends out of the month to three
5283,high_098,counsellor,mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink
5284,high_098,client,the days that we drink or mostly like I said their parties so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and you know having everyone have fun and then when we don't it's a lot more relaxed it's a lot more hanging out playing board games watching the movie it's not yeah so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get down there
5285,high_098,counsellor,okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games
5286,high_098,client,I think of them as as different i think you know night in playing board games and things it's meant to be relaxing so it's nice to have like that kind of breather versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's a after at all it's very draining mm-hmm but in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have
5287,high_098,counsellor,okay so there's sort of pros and cons em yes okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol
5288,high_098,client,um it's you know when we drink we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not you know everyone's drinking together we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed and not really thinking about stresses or things like that but it can be when it's too much drinking it can be can be obviously bad
5289,high_098,counsellor,okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or times can you tell me some of the less good things are not so good things about alcohol
5290,high_098,client,um a lot of times it will make make people stupid yeah you know people make dumb decisions and things like that way we usually try to be as safe about it as possible so like sleep over a friends house and so you know we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks but um definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk can can be really stupid
5291,high_098,counsellor,hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some something's happening yeah can you tell me a little bit about that
5292,high_098,client,well I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much and we ended up like throwing up and things like that that I don't that's not fun
5293,high_098,counsellor,yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened
5294,high_098,client,for me that's happened to me once it was the first time I ever drank and it was it was a lot and you know what I was doing I was mixing all kinds of weird things I'm just kind of taking anything ever anyone gave me that didn't end well but after that I have it but I do have friends that that still do some time so I'll end up like having to take care of them banging okay it kind of put it down around my my fun
5295,high_098,counsellor,uh-huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol our people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much ok any other not so good things about the alcohol
5296,high_098,client,yeah people can get a little like sloppy I guess like they're all loose like with people and corners doing things that should be done in private and that kind of stuff
5297,high_098,counsellor,so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean this video yeah got it ok all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions
5298,high_098,client,I just I you know have an aunt who is an alcoholic so I I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things. I know that drunk driving is an issue so I you know I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like I someone's house or something a parent at home or something. But so I like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I want to limit that and still be with a half one.
5299,high_098,counsellor,ok yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect to so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then it sort of defeats the purpose and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of glass lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that
5300,high_098,client,in terms of what in terms of respect I think well in a way I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because i'm not putting things i'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there but in terms of how ways i am respecting myself i am I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blacked out like throwing up and everything and try to you know let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not going to go with some random person I met mm-hmm into I don't know where to do I don't know what and things like that
5301,high_098,counsellor,okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but without crossover okay and what have you come up with at this point you have sort of a limit that you stick to or I
5302,high_098,client,usually well I start off by make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in a and how much is in it so that way I control how much I drink so I'll usually just you don't get one of those cups and then make one drink and then I'll try to make it last as long as possible and i'll be like all right this is my one drink and I'm good in that way I still have something in my cousin so people aren't gonna be like oh here have some more like no I'm good I have mine and i'll so be you know having some to like let loose a little mm-hmm okay
5303,high_098,counsellor,do you feel that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think
5304,high_098,client,for the most part it works pretty well because like i said people you know people come asking me trying to pressure me I'll be like no I'm good I have you know I still have some like I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything but sometimes they'll be like hey let's take a shot and everyone's got it around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot and then at that point I'll be like oh well maybe I can take one more and that's when I start you know falling into okay too much
5305,high_098,counsellor,so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like I'd like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself
5306,high_098,client,um I'd like to make sure that I you know in terms of respecting myself of my body I'd like to you know try to drink less okay like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like mm-hmm and you know have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community
5307,high_098,counsellor,uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing
5308,high_098,client,right now I'd say about like like a six or a seven oh I like to work on it but you know if I get around to it I get around to it if I don't I don't uh-huh well
5309,high_098,counsellor,why did you say six or seven rather than like a four um because I still think it's it's important
5310,high_098,client,uh-huh I still you know like I said I don't want my body try especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your your social on your schoolwork and things like that i know that once i get to college it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know drinking every weekend and I'm like trying to wake up early and go to school take an exam like I know that's not that's not feasible it's not a good idea
5311,high_098,counsellor,yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to I think on that same scale from one to ten
5312,high_098,client,I think if I made the decision I was going to for sure then I think definitely like a tent I know I
5313,high_098,counsellor,oh wow okay why did you say it's just because i know that once i make the decision I know I can do it making the decision in the first place okay weather okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that
5314,high_098,client,um I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding you know dorky or something be like hey you know let's just stay in today like let's not go out or something or just be like hey I'm not like I'm not going to drink today and even if my friends do like being okay with them drinking around me not doing it and then then being okay with me drinking I mean not drinking and then doing whatever they want
5315,high_098,counsellor,so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than your drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or
5316,high_098,client,I think so i think it's it's very feasible i think it's possible okay
5317,high_098,counsellor,so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going I think so that's good does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down an alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health your school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going like all right great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks hurted thanks
5318,high_099,client,well my name is Laura I'm years old and I'm a senior in high school
5319,high_099,counsellor,okay and what kinds of things do a plan for your life
5320,high_099,client,well hopefully go to college get you know get enough grades to go to college that's great do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or um I'm not sure yet might be a few schools in the area I'm looking maybe to apply out of state oh alright being away for college cool
5321,high_099,counsellor,yeah so kind of keeping your options open yeah definitely great and you have an idea about what you might want to study or yeah maybe I'm pre-law oh wow okay that's exciting yeah all right cool um what do you like to do for fun
5322,high_099,client,well um on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends maybe go like a party or go to the mall to shop or if there's like a school related event we'll go to like a football game or something like that yeah I like to have a good time
5323,high_099,counsellor,yeah and you have a lot of friends or a few close people or
5324,high_099,client,um I would say like a moderate amount I'm not really really popular or like I have no friends um I'm like normal alright that's a good way to be right yeah alright
5325,high_099,counsellor,so um it sounds like in general your things are going pretty well for you how are your grades right now um they're pretty good a zombie's so
5326,high_099,client,I'm doing okay okay
5327,high_099,counsellor,"well one thing I want to ask about is you know different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them they might you know be really close with family or really have you know their friends as being something particularly important I'm going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can look more so there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination, and spirituality which of those do you think is sort of important to you"
5328,high_099,client,um family definitely a friendship and belonging
5329,high_099,counsellor,okay what's important to you about your family
5330,high_099,client,well I I love them so I want them to think well of me and I want them to be accepting and love me okay and you have brothers or sisters yeah I have one sister okay great and how about friendship friendship I've grown close to many people that I care about so I would like them to be accepting of me as well great so being a good friend and having people who are good friends too is important and then what about belonging you mentioned that one - yeah just a sense of like fitting in and like being accepted you know yeah not
5331,high_099,counsellor,wanting to be part of a group yeah kind of okay great all right well one of the things I want to talk about is you know you mentioned that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of a thing and I'm curious when you're at the parties do you ever have any alcohol
5332,high_099,client,um not much maybe like one or two drinks at the most
5333,high_099,counsellor,okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene
5334,high_099,client,um I pretty much just have a drink just just have it like so it looks like I'm drinking even though I'm not so maybe people bug me about drinking or something
5335,high_099,counsellor,okay you're kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for you to hold a drink
5336,high_099,client,have one they're pretending you have it okay and do you think that this is most weekends or occasionally
5337,high_099,counsellor,how often do you think that you are one or two weekends of the most very much so one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol yeah okay and what sort of situations are you in
5338,high_099,client,well just I guess at a party or something someone's house uh-huh or even if it's not a party like a small social gathering maybe there'll be like a few beers around mm-hmm so mainly just kind of hanging out with friends pretty much
5339,high_099,counsellor,yeah are you ever places where there are parents around or are mostly just just with the kids
5340,high_099,client,mostly just with us but sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to her family as well so well I'll just hang out
5341,high_099,counsellor,and what about driving
5342,high_099,client,um like drunk driving
5343,high_099,counsellor,yeah do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol definitely no I've never drunk driven and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver so that's something that you've sort of made a decision about that sounds I know that's extremely dangerous okay what do you know about how that's dangerous
5344,high_099,client,um well alcohol definitely impairs your judgment so I mean driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that so I'd rather not be in that situation so
5345,high_099,counsellor,you're really trying to be safe and and make sure that you're not putting yourself in those situations that's great you know it's it's tough to do sometimes and I really commend you for being able to to stick with that yeah so you mentioned you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two what do you thinks the most alcohol you've ever had in in one day
5346,high_099,client,no more than two drinks okay so the the absolute most yeah those two okay and
5347,high_099,counsellor,what kinds of things do you like about alcohol um
5348,high_099,client,I've never really been drunk so I can't really say that I like that being or not but it's just I I mean you're just in a good mood
5349,high_099,counsellor,mm-hmm so it just kind of makes you feel relaxed yeah okay relax okay anything else
5350,high_099,client,um no not really like I said I don't drink that much so I I wouldn't be able to tell you okay and
5351,high_099,counsellor,any not-so-good things about alcohol
5352,high_099,client,um definitely yeah I mean what about parties is stuff and it's getting a little late some people that drink like drank too much they start throwing up or they get hurt or they're really loud and obnoxious and that's not fun for anybody
5353,high_099,counsellor,so you've seen a lot of other kids you had some consequences and decided that's not for you yeah got it I can understand that any other things that you can think of
5354,high_099,client,um no I mean I've never you know been friends with anybody that's got into like a serious accident and stuff it's just very like obnoxious thing
5355,high_099,counsellor,okay well so you know as someone who's not yet it is underage drinking is something that's not legal and it is something that is considered pretty risky so I'm wondering what you think about that just in terms of how it fits into your life
5356,high_099,client,um I know it's definitely risky but I mean I guess we still do it uh-huh
5357,high_099,counsellor,so it's kind of something that here it's just there it's just there okay and I'm curious you mentioned you know your friends are important to you and your family's important to you sort of fitting in as important to you and how does alcohol play a role with that
5358,high_099,client,um well definitely not in my family life because my parents don't really condone okay alcohol use but friendships I mean when I'm hanging out with my friends that were at a party or something there's usually alcohol involved okay
5359,high_099,counsellor,so from your family perspective the drinking is not something that fits very well yeah and with friends you feel like it's easier to hang out with alcohol or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much
5360,high_099,client,I guess I mean this is just there okay so it ties in with the whole blogging okay
5361,high_099,counsellor,well when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward and five years or ten years how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life
5362,high_099,client,um it probably will have a very small role if any mm-hmm in my life considering I have big plans for my future okay
5363,high_099,counsellor,can you expand on that a little bit more what do you mean
5364,high_099,client,I mean I don't think I would be you know drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school or in college or trying to get it off things like that okay
5365,high_099,counsellor,so the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals yeah definitely so when you're sort of looking ahead how often do you think you might be drinking say when you get to college
5366,high_099,client,um maybe less than I am now I mean I don't drink much anyway so maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon okay
5367,high_099,counsellor,so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually how might that go
5368,high_099,client,well I mean I guess right now I would try to stop in highschool and once I get older maybe just like socially once in a while but not anything bigger
5369,high_099,counsellor,yeah you don't feel the need to make any major changes but you feel like you could make some adjustments that doesn't get ya that's a good word okay how important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all important not something you're thinking about and ten is the most important thing
5370,high_099,client,maybe of five or six and
5371,high_099,counsellor,why did you say five or six rather than like two or three
5372,high_099,client,because um it's not something I do not care about at all but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself okay so it is something you have thought about yeah
5373,high_099,counsellor,yeah okay and how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale
5374,high_099,client,um I'm pretty confident but I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user say I'm not really into that whole scene so it's not going to be difficult for me
5375,high_099,counsellor,so what number do you think you'd say um on the scale
5376,high_099,client,one through ten favorite quit or not yeah maybe like an eight or nine okay and
5377,high_099,counsellor,why'd you say eight or nine rather than even like five or six
5378,high_099,client,because like I said it's not a big part of my life so it's not really types of people okay all right well kind of keeping that in mind
5379,high_099,counsellor,it sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point yes and it's moderately important to you it's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it what sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today
5380,high_099,client,um probably to stop maybe next party I go to not have a drink at all okay
5381,high_099,counsellor,do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely
5382,high_099,client,yeah I mean I can just tell my friends my friends aren't really that pressuring it's just like outside people that I don't really know that well oh so I could just tell them hey I don't feel like having a drink today
5383,high_099,counsellor,what might be some benefits of falling through with that goal
5384,high_099,client,um definitely I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on uh-huh anything else um health concerns I guess I know alcohol is bad for your health and so that would be one okay so
5385,high_099,counsellor,it's it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking any more at least at the next party and seeing how it goes yeah okay do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if it's working out for you yeah that would be okay alright great and then it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do right okay well very good is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know
5386,high_099,client,um how would you advise me till I get maybe my friends to stop drinking oh
5387,high_099,counsellor,that's a great question so a lot of times kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol but of course that's harder if you're not the one planning so some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say and there's already alcohol there and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are you know carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it so you know even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or you know if people are having a mixed drink just having the coke say without any all mixed into it often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something in it kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there do you think any of those things might work for you
5388,high_099,client,yeah for sure
5389,high_099,counsellor,okay what about in terms of talking to your friends about it have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan too I need to stop drinking I was just planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore that wasn't me uh-huh no your friends would be pretty comfortable with that yeah I mean now it's my closest friends for sure okay great any other concerns or questions anything else I go but no I think I'm okay okay so then like I said I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going and then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together okay great that's sound okay yeah all
5390,high_100,client,I mainly just drink whenever I'm at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer. I'll take sips every now and then. But it's not something that I feel hovers around my life.
5391,high_100,counsellor,it's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority yeah how much do you think you're drinking
5392,high_100,client,I guess I would say like every other every other weekend maybe a breathe every two weeks on occasion. Maybe if there's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer just to drink with my boys. But other than that I don't really see it as much of a of a problem.
5393,high_100,counsellor,so you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend yeah I guess you can say that well how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't
5394,high_100,client,um when I'm not drinking I'm usually more like involved in doing like more productive things like I I try and do more school work whenever I have the time or whatever I like I can go work out or something just like when whenever I'm drinking I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friends
5395,high_100,counsellor,okay so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends when you don't drink but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well
5396,high_100,client,yeah I mean I whenever I'm drinking I know that I'm devoting time to to not doing other things so I try and make it so that I don't allow myself to pile on so much work so I try and like get work done before but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity so I'd try and minimize that as much as possible
5397,high_100,counsellor,you're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done yeah knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder yeah and it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink
5398,high_100,client,yeah I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit but just because like when I'm drinking I'm I'm not really focused on what I have to do I'm focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that I have at that time and it's really something that I just it's something of an like a pleasure giver so I can enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing
5399,high_100,counsellor,what are the things you enjoy about the drinking
5400,high_100,client,just the way that it it's sort of like liberates you it makes you it makes you feel like a more confident more energetic person that you don't feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself and it's something that you it it's just empowering to a degree
5401,high_100,counsellor,okay so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways yeah yeah okay are there any not-so-good things about drinking
5402,high_100,client,um whenever I drink too much I sort of lose control of myself and I I had just a like the aftermath of whenever I drank too much or whenever I my friends mix drinks and it just has a harmful effect in my body and that's probably one of the major drawbacks that I have from drinking
5403,high_100,counsellor,what kinds of things happen
5404,high_100,client,I mainly when when I puke or it's just the feeling that I get in my stomach if I drink too much. It's just very over like you notice in your body doing.
5405,high_100,counsellor,how much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time
5406,high_100,client,Wow I would say probably at a friend one of my friends had a birthday party recently and he wanted to let loose. It was it was just a all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party. And I just I losted I drank way too much. I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along the way. I got to a point where I lost count.
5407,high_100,counsellor,that was out of the ordinary for you don't just count what's a more typical amount that you drink
5408,high_100,client,um I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night just because I know I'm I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit but I kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far I can go and I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire but I chi I want to see how far I can go just so I know not to go that far
5409,high_100,counsellor,got it so you're you're sort of testing and pushing it and yeah and sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned yeah
5410,high_100,client,just so I know how it feels now so that later on when this the situation is more drastic and more out of control I know what I can do or where my limit is that
5411,high_100,counsellor,okay what kind of along those lines looking ahead you know five years from now what do you see as a goal for yourself in terms of career wise in terms of what do you think you'll be doing in five years and I would love to be I would
5412,high_100,client,love to travel I would love to see the world for what it is and I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is but I've never really experienced that like I've always wanted to travel to Europe or China or something or some place like that so I can really experience the the world that we live in
5413,high_100,counsellor,so getting a full experience is really important to you it sounds like throughout your life we talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience and now you're looking ahead to think of how you can enrich your life in other ways
5414,high_100,client,how do you think drinking too much would fit into you know being able to experience life to its fullest I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest but I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much like often just because I know I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly every single day I don't want to ever get to that point
5415,high_100,counsellor,okay so just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far you're you're drinking pretty regularly but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences and it and you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less yeah I feel more in control mm-hmm and then kind of looking ahead you you don't want to find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control what they're drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives and it's not appealing to it all and and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too much could also interfere with so where do you think you want to go from here with your with regard to your drinking
5416,high_100,client,um maybe now that I know my limits to an extent I kind of don't want to push it so so much I now that I know what I can do and where I can go I would like to mitigate that as much as possible i just wanna I wanna have fun being me but I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol so much like I want to live the dis over life to an extent but I know that alcohol it's just gonna tamper with it
5417,high_100,counsellor,so for right now it feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're you're stopping at three for example or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking
5418,high_100,client,yeah or like not like not drinking like in the mornings or just just strictly for social purposes like not just to not have it around like I don't want to have it like in my fridge if my parents have it I don't want I don't want to have to deal with it
5419,high_100,counsellor,okay what do you see as some benefits to that benefits intelligence is sticking to those limits
5420,high_100,client,I guess I could definitely be I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent like I could possibly be more productive more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life and I think that by not drinking I it will definitely have a better effect on my life
5421,high_100,counsellor,yeah I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea you know I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest pleasure you know if you don't mind I would like to talk to you probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months just kind of check in how things are going right all right sounds good thank you very much
5422,high_101,client,Right so I really I understand why it's a problem for me.
5423,high_101,counsellor,So what's that mean to you to hear that it's a problem.
5424,high_101,client,"Maybe it means that I'm doing. Something different are worse than the shock placed to me. Thanks for coming in today.

The issue is if you like to go out and spend time with your friends I mean he's concerned he may treat you so much concern for he says you're often brought carried out or you block out someone you are going to fight right so far right and. So what is a typical night out looks like for you.

5434,high_102,counsellor,Is there certain situation where you find more stuff are you saying?
5435,high_102,client,"Um, yeah, I guess the reason I am here is related to that"
5436,high_102,counsellor,Is this something that happens at work?
5437,high_102,client,"It happens at work, it happens in the street, it happens everywhere you go"
5438,high_102,counsellor,This sort of respect team? So it sounds that you have been dealing with this for a while?
5439,high_102,client,Yeah I deal with anger issues a lot
5440,high_102,counsellor,How confident are you that you want to change in a scale of one to ten?
5441,high_102,client,In a scale of one to ten I'd say about six
5442,high_102,counsellor,So you are pretty confident about you wanting to change.
5443,high_102,client,Anything getting in the way of me changing yeah oh. No I'm not changing for the better. Reasons that I could change you know maybe to improve my relationship with. Me.
5444,high_102,counsellor,And how much do you want your job back
5445,high_102,client,too much longer here I don't want that job. but if I can have another job I would see any other job but in the this job would you be on the side of.
5446,high_102,counsellor,Paying your rent.
5447,high_103,client,okay well I'm not quite sure what to do with this you know just let me tell you that I was I was pulled over for weeding and so they told me that my license was gonna be suspended and when I came here they told me that I had to get an evaluation when I came here the woman out at the front desk said just that I had to take a test before I came to you so I took this I guess it's you know a few questions about about my drinking but I you know I just want to explain that I was seeing my son in Buffalo and I had probably you know three three margaritas and then they you know I got on the road and was driving back to Erie and they pulled me over and told me I was weeding so they said then I have to do this so I guess I should just get you
5448,high_103,counsellor,I'll take this thank you talking I want to thank you for filling you know how did you find the actual checkup itself
5449,high_103,client,well I don't know it's you know I mean it's asking me about drinking I haven't thought about a lot of these questions before okay um I see Chris of course he
5450,high_103,counsellor,was X go over together sure what asked for this checkup it looks like you scored a thirteen okay which is about a medium so friend dividuals that score but this is indicating is that year at least at risk for developing some alcohol-related problems and that you may start to experience some difficulties as as it's related to that what do you think
5451,high_103,client,well I hadn't thought I had any alcohol problems but I guess this test is indicating that I will or do and I'd certainly open to hear any more
5452,high_103,counsellor,yeah it was definitely kidding you're at risk for developing some popular related issues and now okay and it sounds to me from reading this should I say it looks like we might be able to do some things that occurred that listen to some of these examples
5453,high_103,client,okay
5454,high_103,counsellor,and I see here that for the third question it says how often do you have four more drinks on one occasion you put monthly could you tell me about this for more drinks on one occasion well you know occasionally you know I usually have a couple glasses of wine with dinner and occasionally I'll just you know then have a couple margaritas after that so I would say that happens about once a month maybe your holidays so more towards holidays you're more likely that for money for drink some more yeah and what have you ever thought of that to be I have something that's unusual or is it something tradition you always had
5455,high_103,client,well I think I've been drinking more than I used to I certainly didn't use that two glasses of wine at every meal
5456,high_103,counsellor,so lately it's been more frequent yeah okay
5457,high_103,client,would you be able to tell me what what if there's infection happening more frequent and excuse me piping lately that's contributed said printing a little more people well I'm alone more I mean my son he's just he's in Buffalo and now he's just going to college and I guess I'm feeling more like a more time instead of everything fix things for him I do what I need to do
5458,high_103,counsellor,"Okay, I see here also that the question was how often during the last year have you had feelings of guilt or remorse after drinking. You put less than a month. Let's talk about that."
5459,high_103,client,well I you know I think alcohol is expensive and like I go through tequila fairly much more quickly than I used to and so you know occasionally I'll get guilty about that like I could be spending the money on painting the door
5460,high_103,counsellor,what I'm hearing is it sounds like you might feel like maybe who's managing money to a degree the last yeah any other feelings of guilt or remorse surrounding it aside from the financial aspect
5461,high_103,client,no no not so much guilt or remorse I think I feel sad and this time
5462,high_103,counsellor,I think you have a close relation are you in contact with him often
5463,high_103,client,well he's studying you know so well not so much
5464,high_103,counsellor,okay I also like to look at number eight and the question was how often during the last year have you been able to remember what happened the night before because you have interacted here you felt less than a month so about it doesn't seem that it's that it's that frequent but there have been times we haven't remember what's happening that there's anything
5465,high_103,client,well you know I'll watch shows when I'm on my celebration days month on month on and watch shows and a lot of times I'll try to tell somebody what happened in the show and I can't remember so that's what it is
5466,high_103,counsellor,okay had there been are there other instances in which maybe you couldn't remember certain facts about the day that you contributed to drinking
5467,high_103,client,well I don't know whether I attribute those to drinking or not but certainly my numbers not as good as it was
5468,high_103,counsellor,that makes sense I may be too also number Alaska let's review it says has a relative or friend or a doctor or other health care worker and concerned about your drinking or suggested you clip down and you put yester in the last year
5469,high_103,client,well my son even though if he's fixing margaritas he will tell me that I shouldn't be drinking down there zone before I get on the road so that's the relative that's expressed some concern
5470,high_103,counsellor,have you guys had this conversation often
5471,high_103,client,no I I mean I go and see him maybe once every three months so I he knows I like margaritas so they'll fix me margaritas but you know usually be before I leave and he usually expresses concern so probably about once every three months
5472,high_103,counsellor,how far is the district from where you live to where his college about two hours about two hours so you guys get together spend some quality time and then towards the ending of your stay you'll have a drink or a fixture margarita and then you'll get on the road yeah and um that sounds like the scenario they probably have lets you being pulled over yeah I'm wondering if if in lieu of what's happening in kind of in lieu of what this assessment has highlighted what do you think about the connection this window with that particular activity and the drug in home
5473,high_103,client,well I think it's a wake-up call that I shouldn't be combining the two as much as I am so I know they're going to ask me to do some things for as treatment goes through to get my license back so I imagine that you have a program here that I can sign off for or something
5474,high_103,counsellor,we do have some services you can't stand up before and what I'm hearing is something maybe open to something like that sure which I think it is really important for our success together
5475,high_103,client,well that's embarrassing I hate telling people that I was pulled over for weeding
5476,high_103,counsellor,you know these things happen and I think it's very important that you're here and that you're speaking to me about this particular issue and I think it's even more important that you're going to do something about it and I think she got to text me success okay wonderful it's great to hear that thanks thanks so much to doing this was absolutely like you understood that explain this I'm totally open because this has never happened
5477,high_104,client,OK
5478,high_104,counsellor,I understand that he wants to talk but some of the difficulties that you've been experiencing lately.
5479,high_104,client,Well it was a really good idea. Friend of mine when he says he you want to be coming.
5480,high_104,counsellor,Tell me about what your Branda is concerned
5481,high_104,client,she thinks I'm drinking too much and. I don't I don't think so but she said if I did I mean that we're going to reconsider the relationship OK
5482,high_104,counsellor,I appreciate you taking a big step and coming here to see me today. I'm sure your relationship means a lot to you and you definitely want to sort things out with your partner. I do you know. Can you tell me a bit more about what Brenda's concerned and how you see the situation?
5483,high_104,client,well she says I'm drinking too much. I don't I don't think I have to have a couple drinks with friends you know after work OK You know
5484,high_104,counsellor,what do you work as

5501,high_104,client,Depends on the night what's happening with the boys yeah can't can get that much
5502,high_104,counsellor,OK what would be the maximum you could you would drink in a day.

5535,high_104,client,Of I feel it is fairly more or. The word of the fighting the getting brand of is that she doesn't like it you see the problem so. You might have to look at that mission OK well.
5536,high_104,counsellor,Tell me tell me what you think of the other good things about drinking what does drinking do for you
5537,high_104,client,helps me relax after work. Hanging out of the boys. Yeah I have a voice being pretty shy I as a person is a troll. So I do need you know that confidence T: OK So correct me if I'm wrong it gives you confidence because you generally are a shy person it helps you relax after work yes but we've spoken about the good things if I have to ask you what is the less good things about drinking what would that be. Well this. Is the drink driving charge. The obviously the fighting Brenda. Get pretty. Scared of me sometimes. The thoughts of the partner when I broke my hand had to take a couple weeks off work which was expensive you know. Parents said that I'm looking less healthy.
5538,high_104,counsellor,You mentioned that parents of. The talked about you looking at a little bit less healthy. Do you have any medical problems at all or diabetes high blood pressure. And can. That ever have faints or seizures as a result of not having or call having alcohol.
5539,high_104,client,No not that I have a ripple or like
5540,high_104,counsellor,so just to summarize the less good things that you mentioned you talked about your relationship your family's really really concerned. The drinking driving charge as the five as yet where you ended up hurting yourself quite seriously. And then the other there's good things you can think of
5541,high_104,client,not felt great in the morning after a big one so the one where the hang over is you know.
5542,high_104,counsellor,We've looked at the positives the drinking the negatives the drinking What foods do you have now. More.
5543,high_104,client,I guess there are more negative. And who are. Specially Brenda in the fight in the ultimatums. She may have a point. But what concerns you the most about about currently if we look at your drinking what concerns you the most losing Branda you know.
5544,high_104,counsellor,What what do you think. Of the advantages of you actually stopping or cutting down the drinking buddy thing might be the advantages.
5545,high_104,client,To improve relationship. Health health benefit is yeah. I guess I'd be saving some money yeah yeah. Yeah.
5546,high_104,counsellor,I mean all those things that encourage you to make a change or yeah there would be made. Do you feel that I mean what other any other things that would encourage you to actually make that change. I don't think I'm getting around well the fact that you're here in the case that it is a part of you sort of wants to wants to maybe make a change or look at it seriously and would I be right in saying oh. Yeah yeah OK. Well what do you think might be the practical things that would help you make that change if you did decide to make that. I'm not sure I'm over well that's something we can definitely talk about further you know we can always come up if you do decide to cut down drinking and look at it seriously then can talk about different strategies to do that. Do you do you have any fears about making that change you know stopping drinking because I understand it is a big part of your life do you have any fears about stopping it.
5547,high_104,client,Or the maybe hard to hang out with the boys. And not have a drink. That's about it. So do you say it is a problem no drinking or great
5548,high_104,counsellor,I think there are a number of things that we need to consider. Firstly the the amount you drinking which is approximately as you said you know looking at five drinks an average per day is definitely above the recommended guidelines for safe drinking. In definitely no strain and also in the United Kingdom soup the normal recommended guidelines would be about two stand drinks per day so obviously as you're exceeding it it's definitely above the safe limits of drinking. But in addition you've also got certain characteristics that fulfill a quite serious for what we would call alcohol dependence. OK Now what that means is your alcohol use a sort of. Escalated to a level where you where your body's gotten very very used to it so you're craving for a drink you find difficult stopping in one your bodies requiring more alcohol to get the same effect. OK at the same time it's affecting several aspects of your life it's affecting your relationship. You know social life in the sense that you know you've gotten into trouble with the police you've gotten into fights you know sometimes things can have disastrous consequences with the fight except for your family members a big concern and the concern that this is If things progress you know the amount that you will need will recall will because of the tolerance that alcohol can induce in the body because the body gets used to the amount of drinking that one more and more over time to get the same effect as a result of that it can have both psychological and physical consequences on the physical consequences can be it can affect your liver to a great extent it can affect your brain again just in if in the extent and also of course psychological consequences can cause depression anxiety so there are several things that we need to look at and that this level of drinking it definitely I would consider it problematic so it's something that we can look out. And and talk about further. OK but I appreciate that again I say that you've taken and it's a very very big step that you've taken to come in here in and talk to me to there. And you do seem like you you want to make. A difference to your relationship. What I like to do is to give you some information to take on
5549,high_104,client,OK OK
5550,high_104,counsellor,about alcohol in the harmful effects of alcohol and one's life one's health because it tends to affect several domains of one's life you know financial social occupational health of the psychological and physical health other family members. Is all those to the several things that Uncle can affect the like you have a read of it and what we can do is we can have a meeting with yourself and Brenda next time and we can look at it for them does that seem reasonable a sense of oh well thanks for coming in today I'll give you some information take a little catch up in two weeks thank you.
5551,high_105,client,"maybe you can tell me okay here goes my name is Hillary and I'm a freshman here at UT my parents live in Ohio that's where I'm from originally, Cleveland, Ohio I'm here at UT for the veterinary program I heard was pretty good passionate about animals it's what I want to do so I decided to go here I won't really know why my parents are making me come talk to you I guess I think I have an anxiety problem or something whole thing is actually pretty stupid if you ask me"
5552,high_105,counsellor,well I've heard ohio is a pretty nice place to live and the veterinary program is great here at UT um tell me a little bit more about why your parents think you should come to counseling
5553,high_105,client,all right fine my parents told me that if I didn't go see a counselor than they wouldn't pay my tuition anymore and I don't work while I'm in school and i would say tuition is astronomical but i guess they might be kind of worried because i haven't met a lot of people here in Tennessee I don't know it's just so different from Ohio I had a lot of friends back home I was even homecoming queen in high school and I don't know things are just so different I've been having trouble making friends so I guess I've just been throwing myself more into my school work and I mean I really do get anxious sometimes about school sometimes I feel like I've changed employees but it doesn't everyone
5554,high_105,counsellor,wow what a big transition for you to move from Ohio to Tennessee takes a really strong person to be able to do that so I hear that you're kind of lonely hearing to this II and things are really different from back home so you're too been trying to keep yourself busy with school school work and sometimes you get overwhelmed
5555,high_105,client,yeah my parents told me that I've been having anxiety attacks what do they know I mean they're not even here I guess they could be right I don't know I feel like I just don't have time for this I really need to be studying
5556,high_105,counsellor,okay I hear what you're saying that your studies are really important to you let's try to focus on why we're here today tell me more about feeling overwhelmed with school
5557,high_105,client,well there's just so much work I'm taking hours I heard they have any time to do it or anything that I even want to do I really just want to do well in school but not my parents are riding me about this counseling thing it's just way too much I don't think that I exactly need counseling but I guess I'm here so here I am okay
5558,high_105,counsellor,so it sounds like you have a large workload and you already have a lot on your plate and now your parents are nagging you about going to counseling
5559,high_105,client,yeah that sounds pretty overwhelming and I don't know I mean I had a big course load in high school I took AP classes I play two sports after school softball and basketball I was in several clubs and on committees and I was a little stressed out then but I didn't get worked up then like I do now I feel like I was much better able to manage stress then not like now
5560,high_105,counsellor,okay see so you had a lot of commitments in high school you did get stressed out but that was a little different it was a lower level stress compared to how you're feeling now it sounds like you had control over your stress level that time what did you do differently in high school to help you alleviate this stress
5561,high_105,client,nothing I guess but I had a lot of friends at the time we're all going through the same thing and I guess I felt like I've always had someone to talk to other than my parents you know we would always go to dinner or hang out together after school we were go shopping even if we didn't have money I felt like they really really cared about me I felt it felt so good to vent people who really knew what was going on but then we all went to different colleges and we all just kind of lost touch
5562,high_105,counsellor,okay so it sounds like you felt like you had a lot of people that you could turn to at that time and now you can exactly turn to them like you once did because you decided to go off to different schools
5563,high_105,client,yeah I really did and my friends back home really helped me through a lot of tough times
5564,high_105,counsellor,it sounds like it so what do you think it would be like here at UT if you would continue to go to counseling and we're eventually able to feel less overwhelmed than how you feel now about your course load
5565,high_105,client,I mean I guess that would be okay actually it would be really nice to not feel so stressed all the time. I hate it when I get so stressed that I can't breathe. It's really scary. I just can't catch my breath but I don't know. I really don't have time for this. I have so much homework I need to get done every day. I mean I'm taking hours. It's a lot.
5566,high_105,counsellor,okay so on one hand you feel like it would be a relief to be less stressed and overwhelmed about your schoolwork and then on the other hand you feel like you just don't have time to go to counseling because you have so much work to do
5567,high_105,client,yeah exactly I feel kind of like it's a double-edged sword
5568,high_105,counsellor,and um what worries you about the anxiety you've been feeling lately
5569,high_105,client,hmm I guess it would be really tough to get through school if I was so stressed out all the time like this but I do think I would be able to get through it I'm a really good student but I don't know I just wish I could figure out how to manage my stress well just like I did in high school
5570,high_105,counsellor,okay so you're really devoted to your studies and you think that you could be able to get through it but you're hoping to find some new techniques to help you manage your stress while you're here at UT
5571,high_105,client,yeah I guess that's why my parents want me to see a counselor to kind of help me figure out how to become less stressed I don't know I feel like my parents just won't get off my back about the counseling thing you need to talk to a professional about how you feel over and over every time to talk on the phone it's like a broken record honestly I just think that they are trying to control me just like they did in high school always telling you do your homework get good grades stand up straight stop texting at the dinner table oh it was exhausting I haven't met anyone here that gets me
5572,high_105,counsellor,so it sounds like your parents have been voicing a lot of concern about you lately and they really care about what's going on with you and it makes you feel like you did when you lived with them in high school and it's hard because you can't find anybody here that you can fit to
5573,high_105,client,yeah I mean I guess you could say it like that they do really care about me and I have made a few acquaintances in my classes but the other day one of them told me that I get more stressed out than I should like where does he get off telling you that I don't know being here without my real friends makes me feel like no one is really paying attention to me
5574,high_105,counsellor,okay so you feel like you don't have a single person here in Knoxville that cares about you
5575,high_105,client,well no I mean the people I met in class did seem concerned about me I just don't feel quite as close to them as I did to my friends back up I could talk to my friends about coming about anything I mean anything they were always there no matter what
5576,high_105,counsellor,okay um so you do feel like there are a few people here and not spill that are concerned about you um let's do some activities that I like to do with some of my clients um and then we can talk about them I like to call this first activity the confidence ruler okay so go there's just a little scale on there and on a scale from one to ten can you show me how confident you are that you will eventually be able to manage your stress and figure how to manage it better okay I fancy so you pointed to his six um can you tell me a little bit about why you pointed to a six why not a zero
5577,high_105,client,well I don't know i was able to figure out how to cope with a busy schedule while i was in high school why can't you do it now I was just able I was able to do it then I'm sure I could do it now even though i do think that i'm just unsure i don't have the same social outlet that i had my doubts back home going through stressful situations and the work is just so much harder here in college hours is a lot
5578,high_105,counsellor,okay I hear you so on one hand you feel confident that you're able to manage this home course load and the stress level and on the other hand you're unsure because you don't have the same social support it's like you did back home
5579,high_105,client,yeah I would say that I feel like I might be able to I would like to think I could I don't know the course load is just so big and things are so different here than they were back home I see so you're a little torn well let's do this I like to call this a self-care assessment it helps me get a better idea of where my clients personal values are um so just take a moment to look over that and fill it out would you like something to drink i'm going to go get some water myself no thanks okay I'll be right back um so let me know in your finish ok i'm right um let's see what we have so it seems like a social life and education are very important to you um you also rated family and physical self care pretty highly um tell me about that well I've always really liked right staying in shape I used to run all the time back home I even did half marathon it really helped me clear my head sometimes it always stayed focused in school um I just haven't had much time here to do that if any at all plus I really don't know the area that well it's a new city even a new state and I'm always getting these crazy emails from UT saying people are getting stabbed all the time I guess I'm just kind of scared to go out
5580,high_105,counsellor,so you're a little out of your comfort running zone so to say you don't feel as comfortable running here as you did back at home with your friends yeah I would say so okay um tell me more about your family rating on that assessment
5581,high_105,client,my family well of course I love them they're huge part of my life I mean they're my family I just I don't know I'm actually kind of mad at them for making me go through all this counseling stuff I'm in college now and they're not here I should know what's best haha and now they hold this tuition thing over my head they know I can't afford the tuition here so I just feel kind of forced I mean maybe I could pay for my tuition on my own I mean what should I do what would you do
5582,high_105,counsellor,well that's a pretty tough decision and um well I really think that you have the personal capabilities to come to that decision on your own I can tell from talking to you that you're a point in your life where you can make big decisions like that on your own
5583,high_105,client,yeah you're probably right you could say that I really feel like I have ensured since being here at UT okay um so you feel like you've done a lot of growing up
5584,high_105,counsellor,yeah so it seems like we've uncovered a lot of ground today I feel like I have a better sense of who you are where you come from and how do you feel about coming back to talk to me well I still really like that my parents are making me do this but I guess it would keep them off my back for a while and who knows maybe it'll help I feel like you'll be able to find your fit here at UT I really do and I look forward to our next session
5585,high_106,client,okay
5586,high_106,counsellor,good I also notice you filled out one of our questionnaires could I look up your question there give a bit feedback that he all right? okay and just to clarify from my information on average how many days a week would you have a drink that contains um alcohol?
5587,high_106,client,um I don't drink very often if I go out to dinner with my friends I may have one or two glasses of wine
5588,high_106,counsellor,okay and about how often would that be?
5589,high_106,client,um like every other month I guess maybe go out to dinner
5590,high_106,counsellor,okay and only and one or two drinks when you have a drink?
5591,high_106,client,yes mm-hmm um
5592,high_106,counsellor,"In the past three months, I notice you filled out our drug use questionnaire. Can you tell me what drugs you used? Any street drugs or any prescription drugs in a way that was not prescribed?"
5593,high_106,client,um prescription sure if I only use those as their prescribed but i have used marijuana or i do use marijuana occasionally
5594,high_106,counsellor,okay not about how often would you use marijuana?
5595,high_106,client,maybe two or three times a month
5596,high_106,counsellor,mm-hmm and on a typical day that you smoke marijuana about how much would you smoke too many joints?
5597,high_106,client,um well I'm usually with friends and um looks like they'll roll a blunt and we'll pass it around a couple of times I guess I may have anywhere from seven to eight puffs I guess sohini mm-hmm just you know it depends on how many of us there are when it goes around
5598,high_106,counsellor,okay all right well your score on this questionnaire is a out of a possible points would you like to know a little bit more about what your score means?
5599,high_106,client,yes please
5600,high_106,counsellor,we have a little diagram that we use to represent people's risk levels there are people with no use that would have no risk and others that are drinking I'm sorry smoking perhaps on a very frequent or even daily level that would be in a high-risk group but your use puts you in this middle zone which indicates that you do have some risk related to your marijuana use what are your thoughts about that?
5601,high_106,client,Mike at risk for what
5602,high_106,counsellor,well marijuana is a drug that affects learning and memory and coordination and so on the days that you do smoke marijuana more likely to have an accident a fall or if you're driving maybe an auto accident there's some other health effects some of the ones that I worried the most about anxiety and depression and especially paranoid ideations and schizophrenia you ever had any problems when you were out smoking marijuana with friends?
5603,high_106,client,um well yeah recently the last time that we were smoking I did experience some paranoia and that that wasn't a good feeling at all that really scare me
5604,high_106,counsellor,okay so that's pretty frightening very yeah well can you give me a little more idea some of the good things some of the reasons that you do smoke marijuana you like to do that?
5605,high_106,client,um no you know just it kind of helps you to relax kind of mellow out it's not something that I plan to do it's just if my friends are smoking and I'm around then I will you know joining in um it's just you know that social thing I really didn't see it as a big deal
5606,high_106,counsellor,yeah so it's a social thing something that you do to sort of be a part of the group and it helps you relax a little any not-so-good things you mentioned one thing that's
5607,high_106,client,yeah you're ready yeah well whenever I smoke you know I'm always concerned about my job testing for for dress because they do random drug tests and I really can't afford to lose my job and the paranoia was really scary for me that that last time that was the first time I had ever experienced that and it was just no real crazy whoa crazy
5608,high_106,counsellor,so on the one hand you have this opportunity to relax a little bit and just enjoy spending time with your friends on the other hand you've got some things that have made you concerned the paranoia really scares you and you're also really concerned about the possibility that get drug tested that might endanger your job so where does that that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke about like you are now or maybe quitting or reducing what you're doing?
5609,high_106,client,well after i had that um that experience with the paranoia that really scared me and so it was something that you know I was like I really you know don't want to do this I don't want to have this feeling anymore so I think it may be better if I just leave it alone
5610,high_106,counsellor,yeah might be time to quit yeah you know as your physician I would say that's a great decision because none of these bad things would happen T as least as a consequence of your drug use if you quit quit completely so I think that's a that's a great choice what would you say if if you go out with your friends? you sounds like you do that on a regular basis next time you go out you say no I how are you gonna say no?
5611,high_106,client,um you know I really haven't thought about it it's just there's something I have to really think about how to to to deal with it when it happens yeah so I
5612,high_106,counsellor,put a little thought into that some people talk about their health or problems that they've had or some people just say I made a decision I don't want to do yeah yeah you can kind of think through those and come up with something that you think would work for you and your situation and the people that you go out on with
5613,high_106,client,I think they'll understand that has that parent being paranoid you know and just them seeing me that way. I think don't understand if I say no uh-huh.
5614,high_106,counsellor,so someone were actually upon expiry yes yeah so that may help them understand well I think that's a great decision Tonya as i said i want to give you today some information i'll write out the name of that cough suppressant for you okay and you know i'll see you for your next annual vision when that comes due or are you know how to find us before then if you need us
5615,high_106,client,okay all right
5616,high_106,counsellor,good well thanks for talking with me about this today I know these are not the easiest things to talk but I think you've demonstrated some really clear thinking and let me know if there's any way I can help
5617,high_106,client,okay thank you
5618,high_107,client,oh no no alcohol use at all I don't drink at all alcoholism isn't my family so so is it something I just I choose to stay away from
5619,high_107,counsellor,okay so zero alcohol yeah no very good no risk related to that I know she did fill out our drug questionnaire though could you tell me in the past three months what what drugs you've used any street drugs or any prescription medications in a way that was not prescribed?
5620,high_107,client,yeah while going to tell you I use marijuana pretty much every day uh-huh you know yeah so
5621,high_107,counsellor,on a typical day how many joints or blunts would you smoke?
5622,high_107,client,I'll I'll smoke on a typical day really to at least one or two joints a day
5623,high_107,counsellor,uh-huh okay yeah what's some of the good things about smoking marijuana? for you most people who smoke do it because they as does something good for them
5624,high_107,client,well for me it's been you know with the again with the stress of everything that's going on it's just that me time that I get to just sort of relax for me so all right let's get away yeah exactly exactly
5625,high_107,counsellor,so mm-hmm that's um what other good things about smoking marijuana for you?
5626,high_107,client,well you know in college I've got a back injury from football and I will say that when I when I used to marijuana it does help relieve the pain
5627,high_107,counsellor,let's get some pain relief from it um what some of the not so good things for you about smoking marijuana?
5628,high_107,client,well it's funny you ask that I know that a few years ago it affected my my license for trucking they they did drug testing and who course I never used why was why was why was driving but it wasn't my system so I lost my license how long so that was big real big real big financially it's put a hit on everything so well ya know
5629,high_107,counsellor,what are the not so good things if any about smoking marijuana?
5630,high_107,client,well my my wife she tends to bring it up that it's a bad influence for the kids you know we we did use together when the kids came along she she stopped but I continued to use but I guess I forgot to use another issue that comes up it is between me and the wife that no using it has not been a good example for the kids
5631,high_107,counsellor,stress or conflict there because I'm definitely that yeah so on the one hand it does give you some me time and an ability to kind of get away and relax and maybe manage your back pain a little bit better right on the other hand it's a it's had some big job consequences and in addition to that now scream friction in your relationship with your wife and as you physician I can tell you one of the medical consequences of smoking marijuana is that sometimes it actually increases anxiety sometimes just from the drug itself or sometimes as it's going out of your system you get a little withdrawal symptoms related to to the anxiety so you've got some good things some not-so-good things where does that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke to see them out or maybe cutting back or quitting?
5632,high_107,client,we will today you've given me a lot to think about I mean you know you know first a job and then of course my wife and did now I'm hearing it from you so you got me thinking is
5633,high_107,counsellor,information is kind of mounting for you
5634,high_107,client,yeah it is it is
5635,high_107,counsellor,well let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero would be not ready to make any change or ten would be on I'm really ready to make a significant change today where would you put yourself in terms of being ready to cut back or I'll quit your marijuana use?
5636,high_107,client,hmm that's a good skill zero to ten they I'm gonna say five
5637,high_107,counsellor,mm-hmm right in the middle
5638,high_107,client,yeah just just because of yeah that's
5639,high_107,counsellor,why I want five and not a three or a two?
5640,high_107,client,well wouldn't put it as low as three or two because I just like I share it with you just you know with my job and that I lost lost my license with it being an issue that comes up between me and my wife and then now today it's hot you know I I would say that's probably reason why I got it out of five because you I don't know
5641,high_107,counsellor,yeah so you've got some things that are really making you think about it yeah well let me tell you what I thought we might do with your anxiety today I thought we might start you on a medication that's very safe non addicting I try probably some sertraline medicine that you take every day and slowly it's not going to take away your anxiety immediately but will slowly bring down the anxiety level in your life and then we also could engage in some counseling if you're interested somebody who could help you learn to deal with stress think through the issue of what to do about your marijuana use and also do some marital counseling between your wife if you lie what do you thoughts about?
5642,high_107,client,that okay well on the cow side let me let me check let me check with my wife first okay CFS something she wants to wants to do uh hmm yeah don't think about that no
5643,high_107,counsellor,I will take it and think about it and if you decide you want to do that just give a call back here to the office we can set that up
5644,high_107,client,okay all right
5645,high_107,counsellor,what about a next step for you in terms of your marijuana use what would you like to do about that?
5646,high_107,client,well based on you and based on what I've been here and I guess I need to go ahead and try and cut back a little bit you know baby I can just tried tried going how long ain't gonna make no promises maybe just say maybe three three days a week rather than the rule I can try to do that just cut back into weekends or something yeah yeah like that let me just sort of think through
5647,high_107,counsellor,well Terry I think that's a good plan I'll write your prescription you can pick that up at the desk on the way out start taking your medication if you and your wife decide you want to go for with the counseling just call back to the office here and we'll set that up I will see you in three to four weeks and I have a handout for you that I'd like to give you it has a lot of medical facts about marijuana we find a lot of people are not familiar with all of the different medical and mental health complications you can get from marijuana but it's something we'll give you a little bit more information to think about
5648,high_107,client,okay all right I appreciate this and Wow I'll take a look at it
5649,high_107,counsellor,okay very good and I'll plan to see you back in three to four weeks
5650,high_107,client,all right thank you doctor
5651,high_108,client,been in a couple fights with my mom cut a few times but not as much as before
5652,high_108,counsellor,so you've cut a couple times since we've met but not as much as before did have a few fights with your mom so Gina and tell me about where you're at in terms of your feelings about cutting and what your thoughts are about changing that behavior
5653,high_108,client,I know it's bad but I don't sometimes I just want to do it because I know it'll help me feel better right away I don't know that having a bath will make me feel better right away necessarily
5654,high_108,counsellor,you have mixed feelings about it it sounds to me like there's some good things about it and you know it is helpful light makes you feel better right away and you're not entirely sure that having a bath and the mini make hid is going to work as quickly or work as well so there's sort of two sides of it for you wondering if the mini vacation and the having a bath will be is helpful for you what did some of the drawbacks to having a bath and doing the mini vacation do you think?
5655,high_108,client,I guess there's nothing bad about it really I'm just used to having that me release when I cut
5656,high_108,counsellor,so it's maybe not as immediate for you you have to draw the bath that may take a bit more time yes it's a different it's different what are some of the good positive parts about how choosing to do have a bath and self-soothe in that way do you think?
5657,high_108,client,it's relaxing I get to be clean and smell good again listen to my music like it's sort of like a treat for me so and I don't wake up the next day with scarves
5658,high_108,counsellor,it's maybe a big one for you right that you're waking up you don't have any scars you got to listen to your music you got to you're smelling good right you're feeling good maybe
5659,high_108,client,yeah
5660,high_108,counsellor,so you listed lots of positives but it's you know there's still these two parts of yourself remember in some of the other sessions we've had we talked about what Eugenia person what you value and what's important to you do you remember what those things where we thought we identified?
5661,high_108,client,one was independence and two was privacy yeah those are the main things
5662,high_108,counsellor,so independence and privacy were important to you in terms of you know what you value in your life so when you think about independence and you think about privacy where do you see cutting impacting that like how does that fit with those two things how does cutting fit with independence why don't we start there
5663,high_108,client,I decide to cut myself it's my own my decision
5664,high_108,counsellor,so you there's independence in terms of those choices okay any consequences of cutting on your independence do you think
5665,high_108,client,it's not a good thing yeah I'm in control but it doesn't work out for the best
5666,high_108,counsellor,so that you are in control but it doesn't work out for the best yeah and there has been some consequences in terms of your mom curtailing your independence based on your cutting
5667,high_108,client,definitely she takes away my independence and so it seems like a bad cycle
5668,high_108,counsellor,so your mom was sort of pulling back on your independence when and it gets into a bad cycle
5669,high_108,client,and then which makes me more mad which makes me want to cut again
5670,high_108,counsellor,it becomes a real vicious circle almost like yeah how will privacy what is how does cutting effect privacy for you that value?
5671,high_108,client,it impacts it in a bad way because I have to be private about hiding my scarves but it's kind of a good way too because I get to do it in private nobody else sees me and so I feel good about having that private thing but only I can do
5672,high_108,counsellor,it needs to happen in private and that being wanting to be in private at cutting those two things go together but the downside is that you're almost required to be private because you have to hide yourself and be so conscious all the time of covering up and keeping the secret so you talked about having mixed feelings about deciding to counter not cut there's lots of different feelings for you about that one of the things I wondered about is you know if you imagine what what would things look like for you for you in a year from now if cutting is still in your life do you envision it would look like you know so you'd be one year older Zeb what do you think when you imagine that
5673,high_108,client,just feel like it will probably be worse I feel like I'll have way more scars like they could even be somewhere else not just my arms right maybe my legs because if I just keep going then there'd be nowhere else to cut and they just could get really bad I think lots more scars I would not even have a chance of going back on the swim team at all for doing anything like that I think it would be bad
5674,high_108,counsellor,so if just feel like there'd be lots of consequences down the road there'd be lots more scarce maybe more spots and really afraid that it wouldn't be an option to go on the swim team that big bad for you
5675,high_108,client,yeah I feel like right now I could probably go back if I stop cutting but if I keep and once I heal it could be okay but if I keep going the way I'm going I don't know if I could hide it and might stick around forever
5676,high_108,counsellor,so you have hope right now that you could return to the swim team and that is important to you
5677,high_108,client,yeah
5678,high_109,counsellor,I see you've got yourself a cup of tea yeah how do you think I can help right
5679,high_109,client,I'd like to once and for all stop even thinking about what I do to my health. I just do the right thing. Does it certainly?
5680,high_109,counsellor,well well the way you say that sounds like you've tried this in the past and and for once and for all is I'm really determined this time
5681,high_109,client,yeah whatever else happens I just want to shut up the Health Committee in my head but you know rub it's on at me about dude don't because I'm largely very good at looking after and by half of me really I mean diet and exercise what I eat and how look after my body
5682,high_109,counsellor,so you have some internal voices that's disputing probably maybe wait okay with you whether you should or shouldn't exercise and diet look after your health
5683,high_109,client,well as earn full I like to exercise and I feel good when I exercise and I'm in the habit of getting the habit of exercise for about only forty percent of an average week when I look at it so for forty percent spine isn't it I mean it's more than I do no it's not I want to like when I say forty soutar would that mean in terms of time I mean only forty percent of the time do I really follow what I've said I'll do what I like doing what I want to do
5684,high_109,counsellor,so so sixty percent of the time you don't follow what you really want to do what you do
5685,high_109,client,I talking idea man identified said she's exactly right but it feels a bit like that feels like I know what I want I go in you know a bit of coaching on some stuff I set out to do it I feel really good when I do it and then I very easily seem to let it go because um it's evening time or on the way traveling or something
5686,high_109,counsellor,so sometimes what you want to do is is as distracted by other things yeah and sometimes you find yourself not doing the things that you want to do and you think you're not sure that that might be as much as six percent in third
5687,high_109,client,yeah I think I'm kidding myself thinking I'm on a good track sometimes
5688,high_109,counsellor,oh well I just don't just stop you there because I'd like you too much to be focused really what is it precisely that you want I mean at the moment it seems a bit vague here tell me what you really want?
5689,high_109,client,i want to write what I honestly want is to fit into all my size trousers thank you and I want to feel good about myself and whatever I I almost want to not even think about what I'm eating because I just eat things that give me energy to the things that suck my energy or make me blueberry
5690,high_109,counsellor,okay so you you don't want to be thinking about what you're eating just sort of it naturally happens that you eat all the things that give you energy rather than eat things that take the energy way
5691,high_109,client,yeah and if I don't do those things like if I have biscuits because I'm a pig really with biscuits and chocolate so I tend not to have them most of the time actually well I think it's both time but then what I do is fine I can hear myself saying or watching listen oh you should believe that bum doing
5692,high_109,counsellor,so much the Health Committee the Health Committee kicks in zone though so you find yourself doing things that aren't what you really want and when you are doing things that you don't really want you've got an internal voice telling you that you're doing this wrong
5693,high_109,client,yeah and sometimes
5694,high_109,counsellor,like everybody everybody does you know things that are wrong I mean what differences in range
5695,high_109,client,well there is some people seem to it's not really some people seem to have it crap that they can do and I've have periods of my life where I've had it crack that I just do what I do because it's all falls into place
5696,high_109,counsellor,so you've been able to do this before you've been able to what eat healthily take exercise get into size -
5697,high_109,client,sorry honestly it well that's not in my in my Raider okay
5698,high_109,counsellor,so okay you clear about that yep and so it won't feel good about yourself and you've managed that before
5699,high_109,client,yeah I actually do that our Lily was born I was really fit and it was a pleasure it was a complete pleasure and you know I've had bounced of that since just like at the moment that comes to somewhere i'm going to those that it doesn't really matter what size I'm innocence that's the right size for me it's just like ah
5700,high_109,counsellor,sounds a bit one quite frustrating for you
5701,high_109,client,yeah I'm frustrated with myself yeah and as I've said to you before I'm even bored with saying this i'm bored with myself yeah this is boring it's like instead of balkan back relaxed and confident
5702,high_109,counsellor,so you've relaxed and confident eating only the things that can give you energy refusing the things that aren't and then the voice I don't show you
5703,high_109,client,whatever I want enjoying whatever I do cheese okay alright so that's close
5704,high_109,counsellor,that just leaves me a little bit puzzled been really because you clearly you enjoy the biscuit
5705,high_109,client,so you know what I at least it's a start and I can't tell you how quickly I had fun right I'd I think I didn't want my mom used to call posting them you know I don't know even hardly tasted them I just like one them in my mouth with a cup of tea and it's not that satisfying really
5706,high_109,counsellor,very temporary very very very very quick if you could shut up the voices that were saying now you shouldn't do this man and in there well then you didn't draw the biscuits with you so shutting up the voices is really what you need to do yeah do you know
5707,high_109,client,what I think I need bigger photo biscuits and that's for bit longer yeah yeah
5708,high_109,counsellor,so there's no free showcase they just done yeah obviously not suitable for you obviously not suitable for you so so I mean if you could get bigger biscuits if you could get biscuits that lasted a bit longer yeah and if you could shut the voices off job done
5709,high_109,client,and keep up the physical exercise sign which I have done a lot of actually I've made want to take quite found changes this year I'm not all that visible but they are there I don't know deliver really which is good for
5710,high_109,counsellor,what exactly
5711,high_109,client,they're just thinks it made a difference to my general house for the personal things really hope she turn into your no but it probably will there's a lot of course straight stuff i needed to do which i've done and doing that's Wrecking I've got that absolutely crowd a big thing a physio I've got really good measurable feedback
5712,high_109,counsellor,well that's not a very proactive then
5713,high_109,client,yeah that is very proactive
5714,high_109,counsellor,so so you can't happy without you actually taking some steps and done some things there around the road to this sort of this healthy person in a size and if I'm right and thinking is it's not just the it's the health and feeling good about feeling good about this
5715,high_109,client,is practical I've got about you know pairs of trousers at the size why don't want to be uncomfortable in there when I can be comfortable in that could you sell them and get sixteenths with me no i don't to do like so they don't hang well my hips okay
5716,high_109,counsellor,well that sounds like you've barely determined to get this done so i suppose what still puzzles me is there you are really quite determined to to make some some good healthy giant lasting long are you really bored and sick to death of the internal diet committee going
5717,high_109,client,my agent Lee why don't you get about it
5718,high_109,counsellor,yeah yeah so I don't know it sounds to me like you probably you probably you know the only half hearted about their sorry
5719,high_109,client,that's the thing I I think I'm not half hearted but sometimes act like I'm half hearted so as I am I am it is important to me
5720,high_109,counsellor,how important?
5721,high_109,client,I think it's about that important
5722,high_109,counsellor,okay but that important
5723,high_109,client,yeah I was just think that was that a measuring stick to be important important nine out of ten I guess
5724,high_109,counsellor,on a scale that yeah yeah okay so where are you at the moment if if they your success rate at the moment is?
5725,high_109,client,pretty shit is there well it's not actually because you've reminded me that the physio stuff has been coerced really good and that's that's been around a health issue so I now done with stuff with that
5726,high_109,counsellor,so answers was celebrating that success
5727,high_109,client,yeah yeah it is actually yeah but you're still in this not really sure about the biscuits it's not just a biscuit you know they're all committees well it's like I'm lying in bed this morning i'm thinking i'll do my half hour pilates you've got nice space in the in the little hole now we've moved the desk out okay i'll do that before work and now you are at work a little bit and again i have dialogue about that i'll do this tomorrow you know I'll swim I'll get swimming on Wednesday peas on my home nice aerobic exercise so in my timetable stay so I have the conversation about life as well you know what i will do some are a
5728,high_109,counsellor,I don't know that doesn't seem very serious to me really if you know it's like so yeah do it tomorrow nice do dresses what bullets
5729,high_109,client,that's exactly it is that I am serious and I'm not I'm not doing it
5730,high_109,counsellor,so what do you need to do to make that leap you know what what I don't know no i'm not sure i'm not really sure that you really are not motivated the biscuits and and they not bothering to exercise seems to be quite quite a nice thing for you too to counter play
5731,high_109,client,short turn that's what I'm saying
5732,high_109,counsellor,and long term it's all in the story
5733,high_109,client,about this the pressures over like that and
5734,high_109,counsellor,then they'd sugar ups and down to Italy and the fat stomach at the long-term effect so flat stomach for teens feeling good by itself and being healthy that's a long term so the short term how to subvert our Thursday yeah yeah and yet that you've still got these voices are telling you you sabotaging yourself
5735,high_109,client,yes I suppose they're quite useful what was my I'd like shut them up as well or perhaps sure wonder if the voices could be useful mountain because just as I said that then I was thinking they're telling me I'm sabotage myself
5736,high_109,counsellor,you ignore him
5737,high_109,client,which is good isn't it because if I listen to them that's quite a good message to get if you just I never saw that before have you seen this pests
5738,high_109,counsellor,so Tess boring press is the way you've seen them yeah and now what
5739,high_109,client,I suppose the fact I'm know that I want to do this and that identifying that difference between the short and the long term
5740,high_109,counsellor,you really want to do this
5741,high_109,client,yes I want to be doing it now
5742,high_109,counsellor,you really do
5743,high_109,client,yeah like so today i already am i've started today well they haven't have had biscuits of her things I mean it sounds so bloody trivial as they both it site
5744,high_109,counsellor,which is trivial isn't it
5745,high_109,client,well it's not
5746,high_109,counsellor,just my computer okay just give me it's not true
5747,high_109,client,no it's not true you're winning because it's not triple for a number of reasons but I think about it I'm just thinking about health I know that I've got I've got a chronic blood disorder which is not that serious it's just there but the effect it has on me is to diminish my energy sometimes so I know that those short-term sugar fixes for example an awkward for that from the research i've looked at they're just not good so it's not trivial actually
5748,high_109,counsellor,okay so it's not true this is sabores out you are determined you didn't want to make the changes you not really sure now about whether those those boring purity Health Committee voices are useful or not useful
5749,high_109,client,know so um don't worry sure I I forget how important it is you do okay and they tried to remind you so the so when I say to myself because obviously it's me I don't really have anybody else in my head so it's like it needs to be different message that I'm telling myself does it because you see I forget about this what's called you two pina stuff yeah until I remember about it
5750,high_109,counsellor,so they don't look so yes sir
5751,high_109,client,so I don't think about that when I'm you know unplanned and grubbing what I can I get really hungry than I crumb fooding run and really I prefer savory food mostly
5752,high_109,counsellor,okay
5753,high_109,client,I really do love chocolate and I'd like chocolates a treat you know to have some town and the KUSI's shut the fuck up for when I'm having chocolate so that I can just if I'm going to do it I want to enjoy it fully
5754,high_109,counsellor,okay ah C Dallas out then understand for myself all the time that for me you know with neutropenia and with just just me my lifestyle and what it is that actually looking after the physical me is just really important right so those voices were saying that yes and they also cheered you on when you're eating chocolate hey yeah they're nothing don't don't what don't you sort of reinstall this determination to get healthy and fit in and fill good about yourself
5755,high_109,client,yes and when I like today cuz you know it's a busy week away again us away from home most of us we can again all this week it's like what about the exercise
5756,high_109,counsellor,mmm
5757,high_109,client,yes I think my mind and body are all connected yeah okay
5758,high_109,counsellor,so so good to have committee help you were there with the exercise
5759,high_109,client,yes
5760,high_109,counsellor,I'm not I'm just hearing you saying that there's a resource that you could before you thought was a nuisance
5761,high_109,client,the Health Committee could be really useful Health Trust except my own health trusts in you heard through my head
5762,high_109,counsellor,yeah yeah yeah ok that's just haha I'm really interested in what you intend to do what what you willing to do to you know to get what you really want yeah oh ok that's well
5763,high_110,client,sure I'll be
5764,high_110,counsellor,all right and so can you describe for me your pattern of tobacco use?
5765,high_110,client,uh it's sort of sporadic I mean it mostly revolves around either I'm drinking with friends or or when I have you know emotions that I don't know how to deal with whether it's anger frustration or sadness or loneliness or pretty much any emotion that couldn't feel good yeah and
5766,high_110,counsellor,so how many cigarettes would you say that you have you smoked each day?
5767,high_110,client,uh like I said I'm sporadic I don't smoke the same every day but on average maybe a half a pack a day I mean it could be none one day and then the full pack another day and so but maybe on average a half a pack
5768,high_110,counsellor,okay and how soon after you wake up in the mornings do you have your first cigarette?
5769,high_110,client,uh you know it's not right away from me normally I in most days it will probably when I'm in in the car and the way to work you know and just it's one of those places where I'm in a car and start the car and light a cigarette and you know follows right afterwards
5770,high_110,counsellor,well it seems like you have a lot of awareness of your triggers for smoking
5771,high_110,client,uh yeah you know I don't I don't I think crave it in a way that I think maybe most people do all the time I just have situations for sure that that I by smoking you know
5772,high_110,counsellor,okay and how long have you been smoking?
5773,high_110,client,I had my first cigarette when I was years old
5774,high_110,counsellor,and has your pattern been the same since then?
5775,high_110,client,uh you know what varies a little bit but but it's mostly been like that you know I never smoked a lot more than I do right now or really even a lot less it's mostly been mostly about same on average
5776,high_110,counsellor,and so are you interested in stopping smoking?
5777,high_110,client,uh yeah I mean I I I quit all the time frankly I I've thrown away you know half full packs and and and swear I'm done and then I think I'm done but it only lasts for for a few days and then you know either I'm out with friends drinking all right I I get upset and then and then without even thinking about it I go and buy a pack on I'm a smoker again yeah
5778,high_110,counsellor,and so those times when you decide to quit what are your reasons for quitting?
5779,high_110,client,uh well i think i'm stupid for smoking you know i mean i think everybody knows that it's horrible for you and do awful things to you and your lung cancer and kill you you know and then i have asthma too and so put it on top of that and I you know more recently I've seen family members die lung cancer and it's awful a horrible way to go you know and so it seems more real and I I don't want to do that to myself I wouldn't want anybody I care about to smoke and yet somehow I keep doing it to myself you know I I sort of can't believe that I choose to do it and yet i choose to do it without thinking all the time
5780,high_110,counsellor,but it seems like it really fits in with your lifestyle with the friends that you spend time with and
5781,high_110,client,yeah we we all work nights we all go out afterwards we all drink and smoke and you know I I don't think I could really imagine being out of them and watching them smoking me not doing it too you know I just it would do all it takes is being around it you know and I'm smoke with them
5782,high_110,counsellor,yeah well it sounds like it's really it helps you to connect with them and part of socializing
5783,high_110,client,well yeah I mean yeah I don't they don't pressure me to do or anything it's just being having it all around me you know and having a drink in one hand you know like it's it's like it couldn't be any other way you know just being being around it and and and people spoken and I'm I'm gonna smoke with them too
5784,high_110,counsellor,it also sounds like when you're really feeling bad or feeling negative emotions that it's the one thing that you know you can go to and for a little while anyways it helps you to feel better
5785,high_110,client,uh yeah I with any kind of emotion that I don't know how to deal with it just feels like a ton of pressure inside of me and and and smoking two cigarettes like pushing the pressure release valve you know like I just but I feel relief and I don't feel nearly as angry or sad or frustrated or whatever and and so it does what I mean it to do I guess
5786,high_110,counsellor,let's stop here so we can discuss what you have seen so far consider the following questions how do you think this conversation is going so far? how effective is the assessment? are there other questions you want to ask? what have we learned so far about Ken's smoking pattern and history? what are your initial thoughts about potential tobacco cessation medications and counseling strategies? let's see what happens next and so right now in this moment can you talk with me about you know how ready are you to quit? so on a scale from one to ten one being not ready to quit at all and ten being you know you would set a quit date right now where are you? c at huh you know I would say maybe six or seven I would say I'd be I'd be happy to be done you know I'd be happy if I didn't ever smoke again I just I just don't really believe it's going to happen I guess you know I like I said I quit all the time and now it's even sort of a joke that that me quitting's like not quitting at all it just means I'm out um okay well did you know though that um people who quit without any sort of assistance using any tobacco cessation medications or counseling have a four percent chance of success of quitting in the long term
5787,high_110,client,you know I that sort of discouraging I guess that no one can get away from it you know but I guess I'm not the only one
5788,high_110,counsellor,um but there are some cessation medications and aids that can really help you to successfully quit
5789,high_110,client,what a kind of things you're talking about
5790,high_110,counsellor,well there are things like um the patch or the gum so nicotine replacement therapy there's also other medications as well as counseling where it could really help you learn and practice some strategies to help you stop smoking especially at those times when you're really triggered or you have some real cravings they'd have to be really good techniques
5791,high_110,client,i think you know I but like i said i don't i'm so convinced that i'm done each time that I quit and then and then I start again and I don't even think about it you know there's whatever technique would have to uh has a lot to overcome I think in my case
5792,high_110,counsellor,so so then that leaves me to asking you about your confidence level so if you could rate yourself your confidence level about your ability to quit on a scale from one to ten one being not having any confidence at all and ten being yeah I know I can do it this time where are you at with that
5793,high_110,client,uh you know i would say maybe you two maybe a three out you know I I don't know you know I can go like I said a day or two without smoking but I've never gone for good you know I all I need is you back in that situation again either upset or out with friends and I'm right back and so I just I have a hard time believing I have a hard time even imagining a world in which I really wouldn't wouldn't go to smoke when uh when times get tough I guess
5794,high_110,counsellor,yeah well and so can you talk with me a bit more about the reasons why you would really want to be quit?
5795,high_110,client,so there's health reasons
5796,high_110,counsellor,yeah um is there anything else that really you know is one of the reasons why you would want to quit?
5797,high_110,client,uh you know i just i don't i don't want to live this way where I do things that to myself and I wouldn't do to anybody i love you know I wouldn't want any any loved one to smoke you know but somehow I I do it to myself you know and and and and I'm trying to start exercising you know doing some running in some hike in and and then I get short of breath and I cough and I'm worn out if I smoked a lot the day before and and I'm not sure you can choose both smoke and ends being in good shape you know I just I just I don't I don't believe in me making that choice I guess to be healthy and
5798,high_110,counsellor,so it really does sound like for you quitting smoking would be an expression a self love
5799,high_110,client,i would i would have to love me more i guess to get there like I said I would I would I would want anybody I loved and not smoke and so if I I chose to not smoke if I was actually be able to do it I think it would have to be because because I cared enough about me to do it
5800,high_110,counsellor,yeah and so your confidence you said is that a two or three why not a one
5801,high_110,client,you know because I do go days a time sometimes without smoking I mean as long as I'm not in a situation that sort of forces me to do it you know as long as I'm not out with friends drinking or as long as I don't have some situation gets me upset than I don't I don't feel it has control over me you know just in those situations where there's nothing else I can do you know but smoke
5802,high_110,counsellor,well it sounds like quitting smoking is really important to you but that you know you don't really feel confident and you're not sure about what strategies are out there to help you and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to meet and talk with one of our tobacco treatment specialist who can we tell you what your options are get you connected to resources to help you quit would you be willing to do that?
5803,high_110,client,you know like I said they gotta have something pretty special I mean I outside of them coming to the bar with me and not going to figure it out of my hands I'm not sure what they can do but but I I don't want to keep Quentin I want to quit one more time and it'd be it'd be it you know so we'll give them a try
5804,high_110,counsellor,yeah well in like you said you know you've quit many times before and for multiple days and that is a real success and I know that because you ended up going back to smoking that it doesn't feel like a real success but certainly being able to stop for hours or days at a time is really an accomplishment and I hope you can feel that
5805,high_110,client,well it feels like something maybe I mean I'm better off having a few days often then smoking a pack every day but but i don't i don't think you'd really quit until you really quit you know like i don't i don't think my quit and I know you really want to quit I don't I don't know that there's anything better I could do for myself if I could actually do it
5806,high_110,counsellor,okay so if I connect you with them with the tts you'll um follow up with them and talk with them about it?
5807,high_110,client,I'll give them a try
5808,high_110,counsellor,in our next meeting we can check in and see how things went for you
5809,high_110,client,all right
5810,high_110,counsellor,okay well wonderful great talking with you it's good talking you
5811,high_111,counsellor,Jeffrey tell me what you'd like to talk about today? um press all you can call me Jeff the time
5812,high_111,client,um I don't know there's just so much going on right now hey I lost my job two months ago and I don't know I was like taking care of myself so much better and it's just I stopped going to church as much and it's been really tough because my wife and my two kids aren't living with you right now so I'm just trying to get my just kind of get trying to get myself together right now and so I mean you're the first person I've seen it for days I just don't know I just don't know what to do
5813,high_111,counsellor,okay so right now what you have so much going on that you're just feeling totally overwhelmed you don't even know where to start yeah thinking about trying to control your diabetes just seems like one more
5814,high_111,client,yeah I did likely from like a bun on a job like how can I think about you know check my sugar and I regular basis I'm trying to just get out of bed you know and not sleep till pm like I've been doing you're even feeling a little bit depressed right now yeah yeah it's not helpful
5815,high_111,counsellor,so it sounds like you mentioned that you had been going to church and then you also said that your wife and kids you're not with them right now so sounds like the people that you had in your life that men were a source of support there aren't there for you
5816,high_111,client,yeah hmm maybe that are there hurry i don't i don't know i mean that's part of what I'm scared about is you know what if they aren't there like one thing that was really cool his on Wednesdays me and a few my friends would walk the Bible study instead of driving and it was fun and one of the friends was named Cheryl and whenever I didn't go she'd call up would be like so you know she'd always get me to go and just I didn't want to let them down i also really enjoyed it so we just talked about work I have a job now but I mean we just I don't know we just talked about life you know it's really good
5817,high_111,counsellor,so that group is really helpful to you not only just to kind of chill out and have a good time but also you actually had some exercise
5818,high_111,client,yeah exactly get into n out of them had diabetes as well so sometimes we were just Chad you know see if people were you know just taking care of themselves get into the clinic doing whatever they needed to do so I missed that you know
5819,high_111,counsellor,okay so that was a really helpful thing for you in managing your diabetes and you're feeling a little bit lost not having that
5820,high_111,client,yeah yeah I just I just I don't know I just it's just it's just tough because you not only do I miss my friends but I also miss being a good husband and being a dad and and being able to provide and just I mean I had to get fluted the church food pantry you know two weeks ago and you know it shouldn't be like that I should be able to support them and to you know work hard go to or come on you know cook dinner help with the homework I mean I'm not doing any I have no structure in my life right now you know I I mean I could add sleep in till pm because who cares you know
5821,high_111,counsellor,it sounds a little bit like you're feeling a change that you can't fulfill this role that you it's not so much ashamed
5822,high_111,client,it's just embarrassed you know it's like I I I mean even just saying this I'm kind of like hope you know that you don't judge me or whatever because I did I can't even it's hard to even just say this I don't want things to be like this you know it's hard enough sometimes having diabetes and being embarrassed around that but throw all this other stuff on and it's too much I just don't even want to acknowledge it
5823,high_111,counsellor,really you know you're really frustrated because they fell anything's going on in your life that you feel like you don't even have control
5824,high_111,client,exactly exactly yeah i mean at least i had control as far as going to work going to charge um taking care of my family i mean those are three things that helped having those in balance i could focus on my diabetes because it was as part of my routine and i got ready for work you know like those just part of my routine
5825,high_111,counsellor,so in the past we were able to have the structure and also the support of people around you it's sort of added more daily basis it was easier for you there's a lot easier
5826,high_111,client,yeah it wasn't easy but it along or I just felt like I could deal with it
5827,high_111,counsellor,okay so even though you're really overwhelmed right now and everything just sort out of control and you're feeling really really hope it sounds like you may have identified a few things to think about in trying to figure out where to move forward all right did work in the past right now
5828,high_112,client,yeah well the only reason I'm here is because my wife thinks I got a problem with smoking I've been smoking all my life and six months ago she thought she got in this health kick right and now everyone who smokes is evil and so that's why I'm here just to please her get her off my back
5829,high_112,counsellor,and so you're not too happy to be here this is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon
5830,high_112,client,yeah that's an understatement I mean I'm supposed to be at work right now -
5831,high_112,counsellor,all right so I can time off you it's costing you time and money
5832,high_112,client,yeah I'm only here because my wife forced me to come you know like this has come to a head six months so just nagging me relentless every day because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit
5833,high_112,counsellor,so let me ask you this Bob what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?
5834,high_112,client,well she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about secondhand smoke and
5835,high_112,counsellor,Wow that she's been showing you and making you read
5836,high_112,client,yeah I got to read this that's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go and have we used to go and have a cigarette together at the table now I have to go outside in this weather you know what's that about and she's to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than thou
5837,high_112,counsellor,so you're pretty angry about it it's pretty aging that you're forced to change your whole life
5838,high_112,client,because of a decision she made six months and she's got my kids on this against you know my son and my daughter there I would it's like they're ganging up on me you know what I mean
5839,high_112,counsellor,so from your perspective do you see any consequences to your smoking
5840,high_112,client,well the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and I in the family but like my dad's he still smokes I mean yeah you know sometimes I thought of quitting but I mean I don't I don't know if I can guy I don't I can quit
5841,high_112,counsellor,so let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario because there's a lot of pieces to it your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too so you're sort of isolated you're put in a corner you're being told this is something you have to do you have no choice in the matter well you have a few concerns about your health but that's not really the driving force it sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore does that pretty much sum up?
5842,high_112,client,yeah yeah I just I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you that you would do anything well yeah I mean we've been married over years and we've never had any major problems like this is a writ this is the first problem I don't even really see it's a problem because we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside and but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned like if this keeps going on like so it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it
5843,high_112,counsellor,it's like it's all or nothing either you keep smoking the way you are things continue to go downhill and get worse your wife gets more and more on your case or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again it's almost like one or the other it's tries to be that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking so I can actually do it that way like gradual taper there are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt recognizing that it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be
5844,high_112,client,I wish my wife could have come today because she feels I have to like just stop Rick right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?
5845,high_112,counsellor,if you wanted to bring your wife along I'd be more than happy to talk both of you okay I hope the doctors work because their schedule changes from week to week so you work shift so I'll call you back tomorrow set something up
5846,high_112,client,okay that sounds good all right thanks for coming in thanks okay
5847,high_113,client,ok oh I've been really busy with school and stuff and like it's just been really stressful if you know I was like the last couple weeks in April it's just there's so much going on like I just I don't know I need a drink
5848,high_113,counsellor,what do you mean when you say you want me to drink like you just let you drag often or it can I ask you about this sir
5849,high_113,client,yeah it's I mean it's cool I don't know just like ever since I turned I've been going out a lot and like I just love it I don't know like I drink like I pretty much only on the weekends I try to keep this weekend's
5850,high_113,counsellor,so it sounds like you're saying that um you drink to kind of forget about school and like forget about you know school ending and moving home get some food or summer and everything like that
5851,high_113,client,yeah i mean i only drink like thursday friday saturday and sunday so like I guess it doesn't really like do a lot of school but no I mean it's think I've does like I'm really stressed like sometimes I just want to get my mind off of things like I have so much on my mind right now I'm so busy with everything like with school and like my family like my brother's coming here next year and it's just like freaking me out like I'm so stressed with everything I just I don't know how to deal with it without drinking
5852,high_113,counsellor,hmm um do you do you see like a problem with three king or do you do you think that like do you like does it make you feeling good or bad or like what kind of like effects does it get do to you?
5853,high_113,client,I mean I don't really see a huge problem with it like I know that it's probably not good for grades and stuff but like when I go to the bar I feel like wonderful. Like you should see it like there are so many guys that hit on me like I get so many free drinks and I just love it. Like I feel like I'm so like I don't know like I feel hot like I feel attractive and like me and my boyfriend go to the bar all the time so like I feel like he likes me better when I'm late. I don't know like I just I gotta feel free I'm there like whenever I go out. I guess it's just alcohol.
5854,high_113,counsellor,well well you said earlier that um you know your grades weren't where you want them when you're gonna go stressed out about it um do you think that like alcohol is kind of having a negative effect on that?
5855,high_113,client,I mean I guess if you say it that way yeah like when I came into school like when I came here I have four point oh straight out high school. I mean like I have a lot of scholarships and stuff and just since ever like I when I turned I like Lhasa on my scholarships like my gpas like I'm not looks kind of Dara Singh good it's like a like it went out a lot like last semester and this semester hasn't been much better. Like like I got kicked out of the Honors College like I don't know I'm on academic probation. I don't really like to talk about it I mean it's a little embarrassing but at the same time like drinking just it makes me forget all of it. Like that's just added stress from school and I'd rather just relieved it with alcohol icic.
5856,high_113,counsellor,you're saying um you also mentioned that you know you go to the bar with your boyfriend a lot do you think that there's any alternative things you guys can do together like possibly like go to the library and son together or you know just kind of have like i annoy you to stay in on the weekends instead of going out
5857,high_113,client,I mean yeah I guess we could we could do that we could study but drinking just makes me feel so good and like I know he loves it like he always wants to go out with me too so I feel like we just have a better time together in our relationship is stronger over drinking like I mean okay we do fight a lot when I get drunk and I get like a little bit jealous but it's worth it
5858,high_113,counsellor,um do you think that there's any changes you would want to make with your drinking or you content with like just drinking you know four days a week every weekend?
5859,high_113,client,I mean I don't really want to change like I love drinking. I know it's not good for grades and like and really for relationships but like I just love it. It's my relationship with drinking. I like drinking Thursday or Sunday and like sometimes my weeks are so stressful. I have three jobs. I go to school. I have a boyfriend and like I just need a drink during the day sometimes.
5860,high_113,counsellor,um how does drinking affect your morals like you like is this I mean if can I ask you like does this run your family or is it something you know that your parents like do and you think is okay or like how does that work
5861,high_113,client,I mean no I've never been like any alcoholism or anything in my family like I've never really even seen that like in my life so I guess it's it's I don't know um I just I don't know I feel like it's not a huge problem
5862,high_113,counsellor,um you said that you know you weren't raised like that you're do parents do you think your parents would like if they knew you drank this much?
5863,high_113,client,to me that they would like it and support it or no I would never tell my parents I drink this much like I know you like asking about my morals and stuff like when I was little like my parents raised me like super conservative like I was never allowed to like hang out with the boys and like I always had to like dress appropriately and like do everything but like when I drink like I can do whatever I want like I love it like I mean yeah my girls kind of go down the drain my guy use aren't really there anymore but like I don't know it's alcoholic I just feel it feel great but people think I'm great it's just I feel excited
5864,high_113,counsellor,um do you think you've used to lived at home when your parents thinking about this like it's something with their degree precautions like you'd be kicked out or baby Madi you?
5865,high_113,client,yeah I mean honestly like I probably try to hide it from my parents but if they ever found out they wouldn't let me stay there there's no way
5866,high_113,counsellor,um so on a scale of one to ten how likely do you think you could like make this change if you're willing to?
5867,high_113,client,of course probably like a for like maybe of five but like honestly right now I don't think I need to make a change like I don't know I just I feel like my life is fine like I'll work on my grades grades are important but I'll graduate eventually like I just I don't know right now like I'm in college when I have a good time like I want a drink well that's great on these a year to four or five and not it is zero or one because
5868,high_113,counsellor,it sounds like you're definitely somewhat motivated to you know getting to getting to you know improve drinking have you ever considered possibly drinking maybe like once on the weekend instead of like four times or maybe even limiting to like two or three let me just something like that four times a week?
5869,high_113,client,yeah I thought about it but like I guess I've never really had a reason to do that like my life is fine like I can focus on stuff with alcohol sometimes alcohol makes me study better like I think that right now I'm locator I'm at eventually I guess I could work anyway down but I mean I'll probably grow out of it or anything
5870,high_113,counsellor,so it sounds like you're saying that alcohol brings both positive and negative aspects to your life um what do you think that there's more of more positive or negative
5871,high_113,client,honestly like probably more positive I mean like I said like like I feel better about myself I look better like in my own eyes I know my boyfriend likes it better unlike he's drunk and when I'm joined together like ever met the bar who buys me drinks like I just I feel so much better about like everything in my life
5872,high_113,counsellor,um have you think about the counseling center here in the university?
5873,high_113,client,I don't feel like know anything about it
5874,high_113,counsellor,or if you're talking like an advisor about like your grades and they've ever like and you said you lost your scholarships?
5875,high_113,client,yeah i mean like last semesters the first mr. I've ever like go to an advisor I always kept them on my own and I went to the Assizes they like weren't happy at all they told me he's like step it off and get my great together I need to work harder in all my classes and I was going to be in forever and I'm just like you know what like I don't know what I do need to work with my great-aunts bullet I mean I didn't know
5876,high_113,counsellor,you could like talk to them about like other stuff like you could talk to them about alcohol um I mean I'm sure that if you had I'm like that like and if they couldn't answer your question necessarily probably would direct you to someone who like could like maybe like a psychologist or someone on campus like a counselor like I said before effort has a Counseling Center where you know you can just go in and talk to someone who you know it was more about like alcohol like people that drink and stuff like that and like how to handle your problems if you're interested I I do have a number but it up to you know
5877,high_113,client,I mean yeah i guess i'd appreciate that like i mean nothing has really happened so far making change with my ways but i guess i could take the number
5878,high_113,counsellor,um what you said so you said that you're like a what do you think it would take for you to get on like a nine or look what do you think would really change your views on this
5879,high_113,client,I mean like probably my brother like I told she's coming here next year and like he means the world to me and like honestly like if something ever happened to him because of alcohol like I would stop like the cold turkey. I would have to because like he's my like everything he's my little brother and like I don't know like back in my hometown like drugs were like a big thing and like a lot of people like died because of drugs. My best friend's boyfriend died because of drugs and like if something ever happened to my boyfriend because of alcohol like I would stop because I've seen it with other things. But alcohol just never seemed like a threat to me like it never seemed like it could hurt and once I guess if it did I would give me a reason to like.
5880,high_113,counsellor,um have you ever thought that maybe next year my brother does come that a friend that you know the things you do is like it will reflect back on Hamlin kilowatt to start maybe thinking about drinking and you know kind of like following your footsteps if he sees you out at the bars
5881,high_113,client,I mean yeah like when he came here to visit and softly like asked me like if I take it too far and I guess I give the back of my mind I always thought like okay he's i probably shouldn't take in there but like I took him anyway and it's like I guess if he just like follows in my footsteps and like does everything i do i like would be happy with him like I don't even get in trouble like especially because he's so young like I don't have to think it's okay dit to drink all the time and like not do in school
5882,high_113,counsellor,so that sounds like you're saying that you can't really think if you're like talking about all this you kind of feel like alcohols brought you to more of a negative aspect of your life now that you're considering like your brother and stuff like you putting aside you know the bars and how you feel and your boyfriend
5883,high_113,client,I mean yeah now that I kind of like have actually thought about it because I never really thought that ever was a problem like I guess it's true like there are negative effects and there's bad things that are happening my life like I guess could be like a tribute it's alcohol and I don't want that to happen anyone else I don't want that to happen my brother I'm like I don't know I I guess it just makes me feel so good that sometimes like I don't know like when is a good time to stop or like how they know the Counseling Center be like well they really help me like I don't know like a delight
5884,high_113,counsellor,I mean the Counseling Center does offer people it's I mean just it's kind of like what you make of it like if you're willing to kind of go in there and hear what they have to say then a minute there's maybe more advice and probably like statistics that I obviously can't provide um but yeah so if you're will I knew that phone number um but is do Casey yourself improving like do you do you like can you give me an answer as to like how you can improve like do you think you could go down only three days a week at or two or you good for daddy at four?
5885,high_113,client,I mean maybe not right away but I guess eventually like I could go down to like three. I don't know about to that seems a little bit drastic but like I guess I can try to cut it out my study or some things. It would just be kind of hard.
5886,high_113,counsellor,well that's great that you say that you can cut back to three because honestly on you know little by little like improvements occur like you know you if you say you can do three now who knows in a couple months maybe come back to two or even one or I mean even if you have to stay at three for a while that's fine too
5887,high_113,client,yeah I guess I guess maybe it's time to it that's a little bit more
5888,high_113,counsellor,well I'm really good you came here to talk about your your situation with the alcohol and stuff but I hope that this helped you
5889,high_113,client,I really did Alicia thanks thank you
5890,high_114,client,I just fine thank you
5891,high_114,counsellor,good so how is it they going since our last appointment?
5892,high_114,client,well it's been really busy for me I went back to school and I you know with the kids and all the activities I've just been really friend to great now I'm going to add that but
5893,high_114,counsellor,congratulations on all back to school that's huge
5894,high_114,client,thank you
5895,high_114,counsellor,Welcome. So recent I want to get together to kind of touch base and see how things have been going since your last appointment. I know at that time we talked about flossing and there was some inflammation in your gums. And you're going to incorporate flossing in your daily routine. And so I'm just seeing how that's been for you.
5896,high_114,client,well I started off good after our appointment and then you know after in the evening with dinner and then with the homework with the kids and trying to get them to bed I you know I've just not been very good at keeping up with the frosting understand and
5897,high_114,counsellor,that's common it's a very hectic time frame so so what do you what is your routine like in the evening?
5898,high_114,client,well we do dinner actually I try to get that work done with the kids before dinner and we have dinner and then they need to read for their homework and then I try to get them to bed at a decent hour
5899,high_114,counsellor,okay well how do you feel about flossing after the kids have gone to bed or after dinner before it gets real hectic when you start but not goes to bed?
5900,high_114,client,I hadn't really thought of that I always think about flossing you know right before right exactly before and I hadn't really thought about other times probably
5901,high_114,counsellor,since you since you're so busy and it's very hectic in the evening and it might be beneficial to change the routine to wear when you have a down moment incorporate the flossing at that time okay how you feel well that you think that would work for you?
5902,high_114,client,I think that would work sometimes I take a few minutes after I put the kids to bed and watch a little TV that's a down moment
5903,high_114,counsellor,okay people how do you feel about frosting while you're watching TV?
5904,high_114,client,oh that wouldn't be too bad
5905,high_114,counsellor,no a lot of people are no thing that they have to be in the bathroom or have to do it right before they go to bed but be honest as long as you're removing the plaque and debris from your teeth before you go to bed it doesn't matter if you do it right after dinner or if you do it you know before you go to bed as long as it's being done and we totally
5906,high_114,client,sure
5907,high_114,counsellor,so yeah I think that might have you feel comfortable about incorporating in your routine
5908,high_114,client,yeah I think that would work for my schedule I think I would make it a lot easier for me to get it down to where I do it every day
5909,high_114,counsellor,well great great okay well what we'll do is today we'll go back and we'll take some measurements of the pocket depths and cannot do and see where your gums are today and then when you come back in three months we'll check again and I think you'll see a huge difference and you'll see the benefit of glossy and you know what the benefit is for your again
5910,high_114,client,okay I'm excited I think I can do this
5911,high_114,counsellor,I know you can be great okay let's go back
5912,high_115,client,that's fine
5913,high_115,counsellor,okay great so can you tell me what you eat in a regular day?
5914,high_115,client,well for breakfast I usually have eggs and toast a glass of milk or orange juice for lunch I see what's in the cafeteria so cheeseburger pizza after practice my friends and I go to McDonald's or Al's and for dinner whatever my mom cooks so steak or chicken with sensual
5915,high_115,counsellor,okay great it sounds like you're eating pretty healthy what are you drinking with your meals every day
5916,high_115,client,well for breakfast I have a glass of milk and orange juice um I have to practice Gatorade and McDonald's nails soda
5917,high_115,counsellor,and okay how much so do you think you drink every day?
5918,high_115,client,at least three or four cans a day three or four cans
5919,high_115,counsellor,okay and how do you feel about your soda drinking
5920,high_115,client,I guess it's okay I don't know
5921,high_115,counsellor,okay it's okay if I tell you a little bit about soda
5922,high_115,client,yeah okay
5923,high_115,counsellor,so each can of soda actually has about teaspoons of sugar in it what do you think about that? that's that's a lot of sugar it is a lot of sugar yeah so do you think maybe drinking the soda is something you might be interested in?
5924,high_115,client,yeah
5925,high_115,counsellor,okay so we're going to work through this fit and healthy change plan to talk about your drinking soda and so on a scale of one to ten how ready do you think you are to drink less soda?
5926,high_115,client,and eight and eight
5927,high_115,counsellor,okay great it sounds like you're really excited about drinking a soda what made you not choose six or seven?
5928,high_115,client,well I want to make the school's varsity team this year and I would do anything to be healthier
5929,high_115,counsellor,okay great and harder question what made you not choose a minor ten?
5930,high_115,client,well I don't want to be like overweight and I want to be healthy and be able to play soccer
5931,high_115,counsellor,all you okay great so it sounds like soft or something that's really important to you okay and so we talked about changing your soda drinking how much less soda do you think you would want to try drinking?
5932,high_115,client,at least one can
5933,high_115,counsellor,one can okay that's a great start so you would like to drink one can a day and so we're going to fill this form out together and then I'll give you a copy to take so that you have it so one can last a day which is a great start what do you think could help you make this change?
5934,high_115,client,well I could ask my mom to buy me new water bottle
5935,high_115,counsellor,okay and some flavorings okay that would be great so a new water bottle and then you could get those they have them and they don't have any sugar in them sugar-free flavorings which would be really great okay so what strengths do you have that you think can help you with this?
5936,high_115,client,because I want to be on the varsity team I have to be healthy and fit for that so okay great
5937,high_115,counsellor,so it sounds like you really are concerned about your health and you really want to do well in soccer so that'll definitely help you what about your family strengths that will help you?
5938,high_115,client,well sign a new water bottle okay and my friends couldn't make sure that I don't buy soda at Al's and McDonald's
5939,high_115,counsellor,okay that's great so if your your mom will help you by buying you a new water bottle and your friends can help you buy maybe they'll drink something different too what things do you think can get in the way of you being able to drink a camless of soda a day?
5940,high_115,client,well my dad really likes soda so it's going to be in the house I my mom could probably hide it so I wouldn't see it
5941,high_115,counsellor,okay that's great so do you think that's something you could talk to your mom about?
5942,high_115,client,yeah
5943,high_115,counsellor,okay great so if your mom put the soda somewhere you didn't see it you wouldn't want to drink it as much okay that sounds like a great idea so on a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you can make this change Inez?
5944,high_115,client,and eight
5945,high_115,counsellor,okay great it sounds like you're really confident and I think you're going to do a great job drinking less soda would it be okay if me or one of my office nurses called to check in and see how it's going in two weeks?
5946,high_115,client,yeah
5947,high_115,counsellor,okay great so we will talk to you in two weeks have a great time with soccer practice
5948,high_115,client,Thanks
5949,high_116,client,oh yeah i'm a student right now at U of L will not right now i'm taking a little break from school um i live at home with my parents and I I work out I mean right now I'm not doing too much but on college
5950,high_116,counsellor,it's your typical college student
5951,high_116,client,yeah
5952,high_116,counsellor,well it sounds like you're really really happy about your life I can tell with your facial expressions and things like that you seem pretty content to be taking a little bit of time off from school right now and you know that you live with your parents sounds like you really enjoy spending time based off what you're what you're telling me
5953,high_116,client,oh not really I do like my family a lot but i kinda want to be back at school I mean I guess I'm kind of friendly person um but yeah I don't know I like starting out of my family for sure I always like to call you home for Christmas and summer break all that kind of stuff but I'm kind of aggravated because here I am my junior year i'm really excited as it gets missing year and graduate and now i have to take another semester because i had to take out this one and I'm really grateful that my parents are like you know letting a little bit them but they are making me look at the same time um so yeah I I got sick a little bit and they asked me to come home and I thought that you know I can get better and i I just I don't want to take any more time off really I want to stick to my age and a graduate on time like everyone else my age so it's aggravating I that I am grateful that I have a family like them I guess
5954,high_116,counsellor,so it seems like you're kind of conflicted about what's going on you know I'm hear you say that you got sick and it wasn't really big deal but it seems like your parents may have been your opinion overreacted
5955,high_116,client,yeah
5956,high_116,counsellor,kind of pulling out of school was causing you fall behind what you would like to be
5957,high_116,client,yeah i mean everyone gets sick i mean i don't think it's important for me to stay home for that reason you know they may to always be concerned about my health I feel like I think they're a little overly concerned
5958,high_116,counsellor,can you tell me a little bit more about what you mean by sick what kind of symptoms and you have what did that lead to
5959,high_116,client,well I just kind of always been more easily able to like colds and stuff and it always kind of got worse for some reason for me i'm not sure why but I you know I just it just kind of happened and so I expected it when I got to college of living has lots of random people in dorms and I knew they'd be like freaking out on it and they of course were finally by sophomore year and it wasn't getting too too sick you know I guess some days at work a couple days of school you know every other month or something but junior year I don't know I guess they thought I was getting more stressed dollars I don't know I'm kind of guessing here but um yeah so my symptoms i guess like you asked we're kind of getting the common cold i guess but i would just get really exhausted and sometimes like everyone so i won't be able to get out of bed but
5960,high_116,counsellor,so it sounds like you're really confused about why your symptoms even began
5961,high_116,client,yeah i mean just I feel like I'm a pretty normal
5962,high_116,counsellor,I know that you really discuss that working out was it really important part of your life. it's safe it can you tell me a little bit more about that?
5963,high_116,client,well I want to be a personal trainer that's kind of where I am right now like that's why I wanted to stay on my agenda because after school I have to do like a few more years of school getting my masters I'm really excited about that like I mean I've been reading like magazines for training like since I could remember and it's all about you know being fit and being excited about being fit and having like I energy that kind of stuff which is hard when I'm sick time high energy but I always going to work on my own fitness lifting weights and running and doing extra classes just to kind of build my core that kind of stuff so you know I I think that's kind of why or got so much it's really important to me and one day I'm gonna have to encourage you with the workout so I need me they'll love it myself so
5964,high_116,counsellor,well def don't want to be hearing that is this this is probably one of the biggest parts of your life and you know what you're saying and I don't even frustrated but you've been unable to do this inject home
5965,high_116,client,yeah
5966,high_116,counsellor,because of the illness and your parents concerns you know you express that you really like to work out every single day how many hours a day on average would you say that you work out?
5967,high_116,client,I mean they encourage like what I read is like four arms but like I really want to be a great trainer I'm you like five or six so I know it seems like it I'm like
5968,high_116,counsellor,you're like time consuming it is
5969,high_116,client,yeah I mean I like a friend come running with me around smile but a sort of certain point they don't want to keep running with me or like workout me good so you're not a little socializing but I mean it's what we want to do with my life so I have to get used to it one day i'll be doing it for like hours a day
5970,high_116,counsellor,so well it seems to give a lot going on with your life I mean taking that amount of time during a day to run I know it would be very exhausting so I can completely understand that getting the cold may seem pretty doable to you I know that you were referred here by your primary care physician dr. hafer and I know that your parents were just really concerned with not only the amount of exercise that you were doing that maybe also some of your other eating habits yo Mike us try to talk about tonight you can't be a little bit why you think that they're concerned about that at all?
5971,high_116,client,I mean compared to like my siblings on Michael little thinner so I guess that's probably what they're thinking but I need a workout I want to be fit but I I really watch what I eat you know I mean that's what they disease I'm een and you know I'm not just magazines for more than that it's Boca soon yeah videos and come on part of many blogs and that kind of stuff you know what I hotel my own but you know they just really encourage watching
5972,high_116,counsellor,how much fruit you have how much about how many vegetables you have how many you know how much mean you have?
5973,high_116,client,and so my parents had concern when I have very little meat and when I'm you know when I'm just consuming fruits and vegetables so that's really where they're concerned I guess they want that's must be what it is I mean they think I don't consume enough of anything so they tell me but I mean if you look at like these agendas that I have been following other people survive you know by that most the time so I mean so when I guess
5974,high_116,counsellor,I'm hear you say is that you're really you're following with the magazines and what the internet what all the other fitness experts are saying right it seems like your parent ships aren't fully understanding that that's just the regimen in the lifestyle that that industry village drives for and they don't follow themselves so
5975,high_116,client,I mean they're not going to understand that they've never been really concerned about it. I've always kind of encourage them to kind of comment down the heat but you know it's something that yeah I've read these things. I and I want to be competitive one day as a trainer and getting other people to be competitive too. so I they think us here original question was what was it again I'm sorry I kept rambling I'm nothing.
5976,high_116,counsellor,you're doing fine you can continue on as you were we can sort of his head in the direction of I know you really discussed a lot about fitness and working out as one of your really important aspects of your life will you have some of the other important aspects of your life?
5977,high_116,client,um well like i kind of said my family and i really do care about them and so they're very important to me and my schoolwork is very important to me i really try to do well Matt just try to focus my time on that and I also do a couple hours of work everyone everyone's valid during the week at the library so I try to put those hours there just because I need to make the extra money to pay for you know I'll do all the things that I following magazines and my groceries because the campus foods one of the most i joined by our groceries absolutely
5978,high_116,counsellor,well it sounds like you are incredibly busy as a college student John sleeping
5979,high_116,client,yeah
5980,high_116,counsellor,it's something that I think would be very beneficial for the next week before we meet again it's I would like for you to try to do your best to journal kind of document maybe how your day goes you know in the morning what are you doing in the afternoon what are you doing at night time where you're doing just just breathe little notations you know seven o'clock i'm doing this eight o'clock i'm doing this not every single hour but as often as you can remember I'm and I'm likely to bring that in next week for us to discuss that way we can kind of see how your schedule is going around real quick
5981,high_116,client,yeah
5982,high_116,counsellor,that sounds like we're going to do for training sometimes
5983,high_116,client,good
5984,high_116,counsellor,all right well I'll see you next weekend are good next thing
5985,high_117,counsellor,hi Heather thanks for coming in sure how was your trip over
5986,high_117,client,it was okay i had trouble finding the place at first
5987,high_117,counsellor,but you know first time coming here you made it I made it right fantastic and it looks like you brought some paperwork with you and I didn't I filled out the form thank you for all of that how was all that for you it's a lot of papers a lot to fill out
5988,high_117,client,I I wasn't sure on some of it what to put down so I'm hoping you'll help me with that
5989,high_117,counsellor,fantastic well thanks so much for going through all of that e note was a lot to ask and I'm so glad that you're here and that you made it and we can most certainly go through any of that that would be useful for you today okay and I'm wondering if maybe at first before we get started I'd like to check in with you and just see if there's any questions things that you've been thinking about or wondering about since you first heard about our program that might have brought you here might be on your mind
5990,high_117,client,um-hmm that's a good question well I not really I know a little bit about the program actually because I was a client about seven or eight years ago and didn't really things didn't turn out well so I'm interested to know how things might be different and I'm I'm just not sure I'm just not sure with my situation if you can help me out or not
5991,high_117,counsellor,sure so you're back with us again and thinking about gosh this time might be different for you and may be wondering what that might look like
5992,high_117,client,I hope so yeah yeah
5993,high_117,counsellor,anything else that might be on your mind or even thinking about or wandering about?
5994,high_117,client,well I have I don't know if I'm getting ahead of myself or not but I have a little bit of a record for some misdemeanors when I used to drink and so I'm I just really feel like I'm not good for much I don't know who would want me for it to work
5995,high_117,counsellor,so they're really wondering right now if if if work is possible for you
5996,high_117,client,yeah
5997,high_117,counsellor,do you think it is well I hope that through our work together you'll be able to decide that for yourself hmm and my hope in our process is that that we could be partners and thinking about that together and what what work might look like for you in your life and how it might fit in for you how does that sound
5998,high_117,client,okay I thought you might just tell me what to do and I had to do it I'm so this okay I'm I'm ready like I can do that
5999,high_117,counsellor,so thinking about for yourself what you know could be possible is almost a new thought for you right now
6000,high_117,client,it is usually when I'm at home I'm pretty depressed and thinking this is the rest of my life and it's not something I'm it just doesn't make me happy when I think of it like that so to think there might be alternatives or choices interesting i'm not sure what to do with that
6001,high_117,counsellor,honestly and something brought you here today it did
6002,high_117,client,yeah
6003,high_117,counsellor,what was it that made you decide even with all of that sort of thinking about at home?
6004,high_117,client,i'm not sure if this is possible or this this may not work out for me
6005,high_117,counsellor,and yet there was something that brought you here
6006,high_117,client,well I consider my chair all day and watch TV shows I get to watch the old days and its really nostalgic and I'm in my mid so I'm thinking I could be doing this for another or years is that really okay for me my son is he's an adult he still lives with me but he's he's capable taking care of himself and I just can't imagine myself sitting in this chair for the next years and just deteriorating and I don't think I would last years i think i would ask maybe eight and I'm not ready to go
6007,high_117,counsellor,so there was a moment in time when you were sitting in your chair watching your oldies that you thought is this what the rest of my life will be like em hmm will there be something you know that be something more and also you know it's part of the time it's like yeah this is it you know you made your bed be happy with it and this is this is all there is in that's it then this other part is not too sure if that's okay
6008,high_117,client,you know I'm not really sure I want to be there yeah not as comfortable but then the end then there's a third voice that says he can't do anything and so it's just like I just feel really confused and kind of tied up in knots and I thought well I'll give you our try again it can't hurt I might get mad but why not
6009,high_117,counsellor,well I'm really glad you're here William and I look forward to finding out much more about what it is that's most important to you and what you want your life to be like in it in the future and you do know what's best for yourself you have those voices that you said that tell you what you do like and what works for you and and the voice that sort of says I'm not sure that this is what's best for me you have a lot of things kind of rolling around in your
6010,high_117,client,I do it's an just spins around in there it's really really hard sometimes yeah how exhausting that must feel mmhmm yeah and confusing and aggravating and depressing and anxiety-provoking and just all of that honestly it was kind of hard to come in here because I just like I'm feeling kind of hopeless about the whole situation so um but I like I said I just thought I can't hurt and even just talking about it in this moment
6011,high_117,counsellor,I noticed that you got a little tense and sort of it's almost like those wheels are turning again just considering it as the coaches are tracking
6012,high_117,client,it is I just think I'm i don't know i feel kind of dumb it's just like what am i what do i think i'm doing but i'll try not to be negative i'll try to think more positive it's just kind of a habit
6013,high_117,counsellor,I guess and you have some hope for your future that things can be different for you. I hope so. I'm sure what that looks like yet. Don't know what it looks like.
6014,high_117,client,yeah
6015,high_117,counsellor,so what do you think if the two of us together um could potentially start exploring that journey a little bit some of the things you mentioned just in our brief interaction right now have been that you that you have a son that lives with you that is really doing okay and so you're able to start thinking about yourself in your life and that maybe you're a little concerned about what the future might bring and what some of the things in your life that you're dealing with your criminal history for instance might potentially get in your way and how could you how could you get around that what life could you have for yourself at home it's more than sitting in that easy chair watching your oldies mhm so if we may be delved into a bit more of that sort of what you're thinking about working how does
6016,high_117,client,that sound sounds really good I I haven't worked for years and or maybe eight but it's been a long time and things have changed so much I just know it won't be easy but I'm ready for that you seem like a pretty nice person to talk to so I'll give it a try
6017,high_117,counsellor,you're ready to at least explore it huh so um would this be a good time for me to share a little bit maybe about how our program might have changed from the last time
6018,high_117,client,sure I'd yes please
6019,high_117,counsellor,so how I see things is that I sort of feel like maybe a guide or a partner with you in your journey towards work in thinking about work from where you are now maybe feeling a little bit confused or not sure about what the future may bring and then to bringing you forward to however that looks for you in your life and hopefully to that place where you really want to be where you're doing something that that fits for you and feels good and that we it as a program have some resources that we could potentially utilize together our first step would be of course today to take your application for services and then after that I would be able to look at whether or not you're eligible to work together on this journey and if so we would be able to figure that out together what that path looks like so how does that sound to you?
6020,high_117,client,it sounds pretty good I'm how long does this take
6021,high_117,counsellor,that's a great question so you really you really want to know what the path forward might look like yeah what to expect what to expect
6022,high_117,client,yeah I really like to know what to expect that's important to me and everyone's journey is different working
6023,high_117,counsellor,oh you and I together can potentially plan that mm-hmm we can talk about there are certainly certain time frames in our program around eligibility our first step is the application and then we have some time frames and together our hope is that we can even improve on those time frame um so I guess it's kind of a wait and see well know when it happens how long it takes absolutely but the first step is just to get started and how about if we along the way maybe kind of check in with each other around expectations and time frames would that be useful?
6024,high_117,client,hmm mm-hmm thanks
6025,high_117,counsellor,yeah yeah totally so if you'd like to get started would you mind if I take a look at your application paperwork and just make sure that there isn't anything that I may have a question about
6026,high_117,client,okay thank you very much for bringing fun like I said I
6027,high_118,client,hi yeah I'm glad you're here and as I know as I had mentioned on the phone when I set up the time that you have we have found that you're eligible to or the services here and so that means that we can get started and really map out a plan okay and our guidelines are that we need to we need to have we have days to develop that plan and there's a lot of different ways that we can go about it and think about it and will kind of start that process today how does that say? okay yeah sounds good
6028,high_118,counsellor,um in before we get started on the specifics of this I'm wondering if there's anything that you're concerned about today or things that you've been thinking about in relationship to that?
6029,high_118,client,Oh since our last meeting you know it was really interesting because part of the time I was really enthused and part of the time I was really scared. I started just kind of throwing around ideas. But at the same time one thing we didn't really talk about too much last time was some of the this. I've got some pain of my ankle. My car doesn't always work. My son has a mental illness. I hate to say this but I I for the pain I use medical marijuana. I just wanted to be upfront and honest with that.
6030,high_118,counsellor,yeah so there's a few other things
6031,high_118,client,but you know just that things are still spinning in my head
6032,high_118,counsellor,yeah so that you've been thinking about it a lot and about some of the issues that may come up and actually I what I what I put together here is in looking at your paperwork I kind of pulled out some of the things that are possible for us to talk about and I you had indicated on there that you had medical marijuana so I've got that I walk the whole issue with the pain okay on there it does sound like the that thinking about dealing with your son might be an important one for us to consider in this too
6033,high_118,client,mm-hmm it is he has his ups and down for sure mm-hmm create a lot of stress so yeah right and makes it up makes it hard to think about being able to take care of that and and go out and do other things too
6034,high_118,counsellor,yeah you know you mentioned in your in the paperwork that what you you wanted some help sort of thinking through a work goal or the possibility of work at all
6035,high_118,client,yeah like that's it's just like making that decision and really working on it the when I went through also I pulled out a few things and here's what I came up with from that
6036,high_118,counsellor,and you mentioned last time about the criminal history that you had a little bit of concern about the misdemeanors were there that were there you also have talked about in your that you were on the SSDI and that you had you know for your for the injury based on your injury and the disability and sort of thinking about maybe some benefits thinking about that in relationship to work and has another thing we could discuss so another thing that was on there was the education and you mentioned about the not having a GED or finishing up high school and that's certainly something we can talk about and how that might affect work you mentioned the that there had been some issues with alcohol addiction and certainly that is a topic that we could talk about and how that might you know might play in with the work and then the pain management and the sort of follow-up to the injury and what what that is what that is or what concerns you have about that and as you just mentioned you the issue with your son and how what your role in taking care of him or how much that puts on the family stress mhm and all of those are areas that we could start with and I'm also wondering if there's something that you feel is more important to start with in terms of initiating this journey towards figuring out what your goal is
6037,high_118,client,well one thing that's really big on my mind and maybe it's wrapped up in here is that all the work I've done was physical labor work and I can't do that anymore so there's been a whole shift and so I'm feeling really sort of lost about what what's of it what are the odds available i don't even know with physical work there's a ton of things that a person can do
6038,high_118,counsellor,yeah
6039,high_118,client,and i just can't do that
6040,high_118,counsellor,so that's certainly possibly the exploration of what kinds of work that aren't that aren't physical in nature recognizing that you wouldn't be able to do the kind of work that you did previously bright and really thinking about that and certainly there's some resources that we have for helping in that exploration and looking at there are a lot there are other options out there are ya okay for someone my age you think?
6041,high_118,client,yes okay yeah I do
6042,high_118,counsellor,it's just learning more about that
6043,high_118,client,yeah okay looking through them so okay you know and what I want to say is we can end up touching on we may possibly end up touching on all of these things during the course of our our planning process and it's really about figuring out what is the most important thing to you to start with and what you have the most concerns about or what you think would help you most in that decision-making process what do you think well all of this yeah you're right it all plays a part but I gotta say this pain that I have in my ankle is constant it's always there and it's just sometimes it's worse than other times but it affects my sleep it affects my outlook and then I use some marijuana to help kind of ease that the severity of that pain but the pain is still there so it you know I can get up and think my day is planned this way or this way and I may not be able to get past that that lounger the recliner man to be because of that pain and I'm so I've that really scares me is that going to keep me from working and i don't know if i told you but I've got like nails and and plates are not nails with screws and plates in my ankle and have to use a cane and people are going to notice right off the bat when they see me that there's something wrong with this guy
6044,high_118,counsellor,and so it's already it's pretty obvious and it also sounds like that pain is really taken up a pretty big role in your in your life and it feels like a pretty big barrier right there
6045,high_118,client,sometimes it's all I can think about
6046,high_118,counsellor,yeah
6047,high_118,client,is that playing yeah
6048,high_118,counsellor,well how about we spend some time really talking about what what that pain management might look like what what you've been doing and and sort of how you see that playing out in your work that be that's not okay?
6049,high_118,client,definitely
6050,high_118,counsellor,tell me you mentioned the marijuana and you mentioned that you um that you know that you have a cane and have some adaptations and tell me what else you're sort of doing to manage the pain right now
6051,high_118,client,well like the other day I tripped and I did something to my ankle I don't know exactly what but I have a like a boot you know and somebody hurts your ankle they can put a big boot on it so I've got a boot that helps keep it stable I've also got a brace that helps keep it stable it's hard sometimes one of the wound might open up and become infected so then there's doctors appointments and that kind of pain and it's not very pretty what else have I been doing just not I try not to overdo it but sometimes that's kind of hard because I tend to push myself sometimes I take I don't take any of the heavy duty meds i've had addiction in the past I know and they don't make me feel good anyway so that's a good thing I'm not hooked on some of those really heavy-duty prescription medication so I will take over-the-counter ibuprofen and tylenol things like that I think that's about all I can't think of anything else yeah you know I just do
6052,high_118,counsellor,I want to affirm how much you know about yourself that you made decisions about how manage this based on not wanting to get yourself in trouble with addiction again?
6053,high_118,client,I I really that's a you know I really takes a lot of courage to do that and to sort of live with the pain and figure out alternatives well I always tell people I one drink away from jail so you know that's a pretty good deterrent
6054,high_118,counsellor,yeah yeah so that stays at the kind of the forefront to the top of your head to like oh boy and if the stress gets too much that could be a problem
6055,high_118,client,yeah yeah
6056,high_118,counsellor,it's true yeah you know one thing it sounds like the pain management is probably the place where might be useful to start because that might be the most the right up front the thing place to start so we can do that and we can talk about there are alternatives out there and and different programs and different situations that have been useful for others in your situation in terms of managing pain so maybe we will send me to a shrink maybe they'll shrink that ankle
6057,high_118,client,yeah i just know he'll say it's all in my head sometimes
6058,high_118,counsellor,and so it sounds like you've had some experience that
6059,high_118,client,oh I'm being told that it's it's just in your head and it's really that really makes me mad
6060,high_118,counsellor,yeah because you really know you know what it is and you've been living with it and working with it and trying to find a way to manage it for a long time
6061,high_118,client,exactly yeah
6062,high_118,counsellor,right don't want somebody telling you
6063,high_118,client,yeah
6064,high_118,counsellor,that you're making it up
6065,high_118,client,yeah
6066,high_118,counsellor,well I can assure well that that we that we can find alternatives to that
6067,high_118,client,okay I'll be curious about that
6068,high_118,counsellor,yeah okay well how about we go ahead and set that up and we'll start there and we'll keep these others and what I want to let you know is that if other things come up that we need to cover we can put them on this list to to make sure we'll check in about these okay it's time we meet and figure out what if you know where what we want to work on that day okay start with the pain
6069,high_118,client,okay sounds great thank you
6070,high_118,counsellor,mm-hmm
6071,high_119,client,ok I'd be glad to and I just have to say it was really hard to choose the top three and I actually stuck in a fourth
6072,high_119,counsellor,it's important to you there is a lot
6073,high_119,client,that's important to me and I am
6074,high_119,counsellor,let's see do they seem to be in order when I tell you about them? or just however you'd like to start
6075,high_119,client,okay
6076,high_119,counsellor,um wanting to start with family and it says to have a happy loving family
6077,high_119,client,I'm going to kind of family is very important to me having a happy loving family that is kind of a it would be a nice goal but a family that's that gets along well a family that is there for each other and support each other maybe not always happy and loving but you know still there for each other that's really important to me
6078,high_119,counsellor,it's a really a family that is kind of your rock and he family is very different than maybe the words that are on this card and yet family really called out to you family did you know that's basically the only people
6079,high_119,client,i talked with two is why one friend that comes over once in a while but really all during the week and its family so I don't know you know where I would be without them and and it's just so it kind of blends in with us next on the responsibility I Myers my ability to be responsible has increased so much when it comes to family and I really want to keep that going I I feel like I have a I have to prove something to my family that because I wasn't responsible for a long time and in fact I still have plenty of times I'm not responsible but it's other you know I try I'm trying my best to show that I can be responsible does that make sense?
6080,high_119,counsellor,so family and responsibilities are tied together for you and responsibility is something that you haven't always been as you would like and yet you've grown in your ability to be responsible possibly partly because of your family
6081,high_119,client,well especially with my son he started working so I'm there to take him to work and pick him up so that kind of gets me going during the day whenever we have a family gathering I'm always the first one there and I used to be the last one and so I try to be really punctual and be there for my family when I can i really think i'm kind of the black sheep of the family though i'm not i'm not really worth it a lot so maybe I this is why this is kind of hard because it's almost as if I'm going over and above just to make a point that I'm responsible and then sometimes I just feel like I'm not responsible to anyway I'm just talking in circles
6082,high_119,counsellor,so sometimes how they interact with you you don't always feel what you're trying to show them
6083,high_119,client,or I don't always know that what I'm yeah I don't know what they're thinking about me so I tend to make things up
6084,high_119,counsellor,yeah and because of what you're thinking you sometimes then really try to act responsible and hope that they will be able to see what you're trying to show
6085,high_119,client,ya want them to accept me more because I just felt I haven't been all that accepted
6086,high_119,counsellor,and you keep trying
6087,high_119,client,I do I do yep
6088,high_119,counsellor,yeah so this is do these really fit together for you so tell me about the others that you pay
6089,high_119,client,so i picked cleanliness it's real important to me because like i said before i am i pretty much in my chair watching TV a lot of the time or on the internet or something however it's i don't want to sit in my house all day and have it be a stinking mess with garbage all over the place so I'm a little bit sort of OCD about that you might say I have to have make sure every surface is clean all the time and I vacuumed once a day even though it really hurts on my ankle I get up on a vacuum I have a cat so I make sure the cat box is scooped and if anyone comes over my place is always it's immaculate and I take a lot of pride in that
6090,high_119,counsellor,yeah so it gives you pride to be able to show something you are able to do even if it's sometimes difficult
6091,high_119,client,mm-hmm sometimes I wonder if I go overboard but you know that's okay it's my house right I can do what I want and you feel good about it
6092,high_119,counsellor,you said I do you feel pride mm-hmm I do you know you dirty a dish you clean it and put it away that's that's what you do and if it's difficult and others notice
6093,high_119,client,mmhmm yeah I've had family come over every so often and they're like wow this place is amazing it's spotless so yeah I feel good about that
6094,high_119,counsellor,so you mentioned that somehow that also connects with family it's not only for yourself it's also sometimes for others possibly being able to show them that you're responsible in your own dwelling in what you're able
6095,high_119,client,i am and even though i only get twelve hundred dollars a month or or something in social security my rent is about you know I barely can make ends meet I have to sell things all the time I have a clean house I'm proud of and I do what I say if I tell family I'll do it and I want the best for my son who has had lots of rough times so may I never thought about like that before
6096,high_119,counsellor,your boy true changes us when you start talking about the right that you have and what you're able to do with what you feel like might not be a lot
6097,high_119,client,yeah I was kind of defiant you know some people wouldn't be able to get by as well as I've been able to I think so and then I had that humor because I think I'm really funny and creative and it's important that's really important to me to keep that perspective and to keep that kind of at the forefront or else I could just sink into a deep dark hole that side of you oh
6098,high_119,counsellor,so in thinking about family responsibilities and cleanliness there's that sense of pride of something bigger than yourself and you're really working hard here and yet you've got this this hammer that sort of fits in there with all of that no tell me more about how you see humor fitting in in your life with all of these things that seem to be so almost serious mmm really focused well and understand
6099,high_119,client,I'm thinking about work along all this time too so because of my creativity and my family tells me I created more. That I say I'm creative but my family tells me I'm creative. And I we play games okay so I don't know if
6100,high_119,counsellor,you've seen this game but it's some draw it's like words of friends but you draw pictures and you have the other person
6101,high_119,client,i guess what it is it's not easy to draw a picture on an iPad because of the the stylus makes such big lines but boy I can draw some really cool pictures on there and my family takes screenshots and they keep them because they're so cool and then later they'll they'll show them to me and I'll be like wow I really did that so the humor is that they're kind of funny some of them like one of Elvis it was really funny and I just felt like the family you know gave me special record gives me special recognition sometimes they really noticed they notice that have this special ability
6102,high_119,counsellor,mm-hmm and it touches them in a way that you want to touch them
6103,high_119,client,hmm I'm not sure what I could do with that but you know and same with humor just ice I kind of see things from my ionic perspective the and I can't even give you an example right now but I just I just think of really funny things when they pop out of my mouth and and I give I get positive recognition from my family that way
6104,high_119,counsellor,so you really have a connection with your family through the actions that you take in your life to show them that you're a responsible person and these relationships with her family are really central to your life right now they are the people that you interact most with and you have pride in yourself so that respect of yourself and being able to show your family what you're really able to do in your life how you're able to keep things clean and presentable and have that sense of pride and yet it seems that your humor and creativity is something that really is almost a more powerful thing in being able to show who you are and getting special recognition for in your life who you are as a person and maybe a part of you that you have yet to fully discover or to show the world who you can be what do you think of all that feels pretty good
6105,high_119,client,I'm a little embarrassed
6106,high_119,counsellor,yeah hmm so haven't really thought of yourself in that way
6107,high_119,client,I'm usually more negative about myself huh I've got more going for me than I thought this is the best of
6108,high_119,counsellor,William mm-hmm han couldn't couldn't keep it here this this is important to you this humor the humor yeah keeps me going that creativity yeah keeps me going it's almost like that that light ahead that hope that you were talking about
6109,high_119,client,oh yeah yeah
6110,high_119,counsellor,I don't think some people realize how important humor and their life is and it's very very important to me clearly as you see the path ahead and thinking about work and I know you mentioned that when you were considering your values you were thinking about work at that time
6111,high_119,client,mm-hmm
6112,high_119,counsellor,how if at all do you see possibly utilizing these core values family responsibilities cleanliness and humor in thinking about what your life could be like with work it work?
6113,high_119,client,huh well right off the bat I thought of crime analyst because most work environments you know they want you to keep your workspace clean I have to tell you I had a job a long time ago and I was driving around and I would spit sunflower seeds out and just made a mess on my truck and my boss didn't like that I was young I didn't know what the big deal was but now that I'm older it's like
6114,high_119,counsellor,okay that's a really important a site to bring through the workplaces having a clean workspace or being like remembering that cleanliness is important in the workplace being a good work partner
6115,high_119,client,yeah right because other people don't want to be tripping on on my clutter and
6116,high_119,counsellor,of course responsibility because if your employee there's always that expectation that you'll do what is asked of you or that you'll do what you say you'll do and you know you can do that right
6117,high_119,client,yeah I think I can and I'm not exactly sure about family but humor when I think of humor and working I think of getting along with coworkers and you know that's that's an important aspect to work to is being able to get along with others and I can do that most of time sometimes I'm not so great at it my humor can be a little bit biting so I might need to watch that sometimes
6118,high_119,counsellor,yeah so you really think about others and how they interact with you
6119,high_119,client,mm-hmm
6120,high_119,counsellor,and who you are as a person that's those are all important things for you
6121,high_119,client,it's important for me to know or to have them think highly of me
6122,high_119,counsellor,well thank you very much William for taking the time and really thinking about your core values and you mentioned this it was difficult to pick um and you shared a lot about about who you are and and sometimes it may be a little uncomfortable and thinking about those those things that are really most precious to us and I just really wanted to thank you for that opportunity to really get to know you about her and I hope that I hope it was useful for you and that we can use it together in our work figuring out what the path ahead might look like he'll work in your life how can I remember these what do you think when you when there are things that you want to remember in your life how does it work for you how do you typically remember things I think I need to write it down so i'll write it on a piece of paper
6123,high_119,client,sure
6124,high_119,counsellor,keep it with me
6125,high_119,client,yeah
6126,high_119,counsellor,yeah something that you can maybe take no doubt
6127,high_119,client,mm-hmm
6128,high_119,counsellor,how do you think you might use it?
6129,high_119,client,well that's a good question Oh ideally when I'm in a situation where I think I'm not getting along well or if I think things aren't going so great just in general or I'm really thinking negative about self is when I could pull it out and look at it and get a reminder so that's something I'll have to keep in mind i'm not sure how much i'll do it but i'll at least it's there and it's a start
6130,high_119,counsellor,it's interesting to consider who it might be something as a reminder to yourself about what a really responsible person and that humor is also important to you
6131,high_119,client,yeah
6132,high_119,counsellor,those things that are most important the guiding principles in your life
6133,high_119,client,yeah yeah
6134,high_120,client,my son's behavior is just what you won't listen to any others he goes out whenever he wants to go out and his father and I are just fed up with it and his father's already said it since he turns people call along so they're coming getting distorted putting in jail
6135,high_120,counsellor,in frustrating because you have no control of the house
6136,high_120,client,well yeah I dislike these it was kids running the whole house yeah we don't like he doesn't want everything
6137,high_120,counsellor,so you wish you had that pants and power where you can be able to get your son to do the things that you and your husband would like for him to do
6138,high_120,client,well yeah I wish I had that power but he's not all this things to do to us he's already decided that he said said he said I was then they all do whatever I wanted so what's the point what's the point of even trying
6139,high_120,counsellor,sounds like you've given up on yourself to be able to use those parenting things to try to get him to be able to listen to your house he's gotten physical
6140,high_120,client,yeah would especially with my husband swing at it first came in it can be kind of scary to live in a house with a adolescent male getting physical when he's upset yeah it is scared because I don't know how he's gonna react and you might be just fine today and tomorrow just for no reason he's exploded and a lot of weather can hit me take off what did he just tell me home so yeah I don't know what to do
6141,high_120,counsellor,and you tell me something well one thing I am here is that you guys are working really hard to try to get your family back on track and get your son back to the place where you guys can have that a better family family environment
6142,high_120,client,well all the things we try they don't work tries it didn't work and he tells me something I try that work
6143,high_120,counsellor,one good thing is you're willing to trust them to something you really try some new things because you're open to that you've tried and you kind of said you gave up a little bit but what you just said that I heard was that you are willing to maybe pick up and try some new things that might be helpful
6144,high_120,client,well if there's anything because I think we tried at all so feeling kind of doubtful that there's anything else I don't think about nothing else is work so why would people go ahead and tell me the best that that works to begin with
6145,high_120,counsellor,well the good thing is we know things that don't work so we don't have to do those things over again okay so if you had to rate it on a scale of one to ten how how important is it for you to try to strengthen your parenting skills with your husband?
6146,high_120,client,I guess one being I'm not doing anything else. I've done everything else I can do. And me know we really you to try. They really need to check. Well it used to be more for now it's probably about five or my husband is probably.
6147,high_120,counsellor,about you want right something's going through this for a really long time and just feeling like you're the point where you want to be loved but you did say a five and you know that does leave room for hope so why wouldn't you say a two or one like your husband?
6148,high_120,client,cuz I because he's my son and I haven't given up and I care about him and and I think I know he can do better I just don't know how
6149,high_120,counsellor,so you are very hopeful for your family and for your son just would you be willing to continue to work with me to to learn some of those things maybe I can be helpful for you to try to find some things that might fit for your family
6150,high_120,client,well I willing to try mm-hmm
6151,high_120,counsellor,we got to get him in here and see if we can get you to on the same page but at least you're willing to say that you're willing to try
6152,high_120,client,yeah I have good luck with the elbow
6153,high_120,counsellor,wow so you would be willing to come back in here next week and be able to sit with me and they kind of go from there new ways to work with your family and not try those always over again
6154,high_120,client,yeah
6155,high_120,counsellor,yeah we can pops up another water problem
6156,high_120,client,okay
6157,high_120,counsellor,okay well then I'll see you next week
6158,high_121,client,Hi.
6159,high_121,counsellor,I'm one of the advocates here at the center.
6160,high_121,client,Nice to meet you.
6161,high_121,counsellor,And how are you? How are you today?
6162,high_121,client,"I'm fine. Thanks. Well, strange, feeling strange for this but okay."
6163,high_121,counsellor,Yeah it's something really different for you?
6164,high_121,client,"Mm-mm. I have, I have not done this before."
6165,high_121,counsellor,Well why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today.
6166,high_121,client,"I'm not even sure. I heard, about this place and that you work with women who are, having trouble with their relationship and are confused and so, I thought I'd give you guys a call. And so, I'm, thank you so much for taking the time to see me."
6167,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. So you're, you've heard a little bit about the program here. Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what, what my role might be today?"
6168,high_121,client,Yeah.
6169,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6170,high_121,client,Yeah. Cuz I don't know what to do.
6171,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. What I want to reassure you of is that I'm not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or any information at all. I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you. Just sorta sort out what's going on and what if anything you'd like to do differently. So, this is really up to you. What you would like to explore today. How does that sound?"
6172,high_121,client,That sounds really hard because I'm not sure I'm very good at sorting things out myself.
6173,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, so right now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on and you're not even sure where to start."
6174,high_121,client,"Yeah, that's a good way to put it. I'm kind of confused about what to do next. I have a little baby at home, so I don't, I can't think, anyway most of the time."
6175,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. So now anything, any kind of decisions you make or anything that you do, effects both you and the, and the baby."
6176,high_121,client,"Huh, uh-huh. And, and my, boyfriend. It, it affects him. Which is why I guess I'm here, is to talking about him and me and the baby and how we work together."
6177,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. Well, if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story?"
6178,high_121,client,"I don't know where to start. He and I had been together for about a year. And I got pregnant right away and we, just had this baby a little while ago. And, and before that I was working and, he and I, you know, we're on and off here and there. We, we get in fights and he disappears for a while and then he comes back. That's kind of what the years look like. And I've just been getting more and more confused on what to do, and recently I did something really that didn't even look like him. He looked like a different person, and it freaked me out. And it freaked the baby out. And, quite honestly, it freaked him out, too. He didn't, he said he, he didn't know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control."
6179,high_121,counsellor,"So the, in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way. And that there have been some incidents where you've had some arguments and separated for awhile and gotten back together."
6180,high_121,client,Uh-huh.
6181,high_121,counsellor,It does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out.
6182,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6183,high_121,counsellor,"And all, all of you. The baby and you and him and, and was kinda scary."
6184,high_121,client,"Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yeah. He, he came home. I was, a friend had come over, a, a man friend. He doesn't like me to have men friends. He came over to help me with my resume. Cuz I'm starting to think about going back to work. And he had a weird look in his eye and so I kind of, you know, sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as, right after he left, he he kinda just got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was just different than anything that ever has happened to me or to us together and. It, he just got this weird kinda like he was possessed by something and he said he didn't, he would never do that again. He is such, he is a really good daddy and he really helps us out a lot."
6185,high_121,counsellor,"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand he's really good, good with you, and good with the father, I mean good with your child, and on the other hand it was like what is this? Something really different."
6186,high_121,client,"Mm-hm, mm-hm, yeah and he's, he's he really helps us out. And I didn't know what to, to do with that. So that's why, that's, I guess that feeling that I have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do."
6187,high_121,counsellor,"What, what are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do, if, if anything? What are, what are you thinking about?"
6188,high_121,client,"I haven't talked to anybody for a year, really."
6189,high_121,counsellor,You've gotten pretty isolated.
6190,high_121,client,"Yeah. Yeah, I haven't. My parents live pretty far away, and, I guess he's kind of, my boyfriend's kind of I guess the word's jealous. He just really cares about us."
6191,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6192,high_121,client,"And so I haven't had a chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that wha, what could I do? I used to work, and I was kind of looking forward to working again. He's he's sorta made it clear that, that I don't need to work because he's gonna take care of us. He brings home diapers."
6193,high_121,counsellor,Mm-hm.
6194,high_121,client,"And gives us some money when he's around. And so, we really don't need it most of the time."
6195,high_121,counsellor,"Mm-hm. So you had been kinda thinking about maybe going back to work and doing, doing some of that on your, on your own. And, and yet he, he doesn't really, he's expressing that he'd like to be able to take care of you and-"
6196,high_121,client,Yeah.
6197,high_121,counsellor,"And when he's there he, he does take care of you?"
6198,high_121,client,"Yeah, yeah. And yeah he does take care of us. He's a, he's he makes sure that I have enough money for, you know, for the basic needs in the house, and he pays the rent, and you know, but when I, when he's gone and I run out of money, it just kind of, that's when I think, God I just wish I could take, do a little bit by myself, I'm just not sure."
6199,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, yeah."
6200,high_121,client,How to go about doing that.
6201,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, because that leaves you in a real bind, when you're, you're there and you don't have what you need."
6202,high_121,client,"Mm-hm, mm-hm, and I, yeah, and I don't know who to talk to about that."
6203,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6204,high_121,client,"I try to call him sometimes, and make up. You know, and say sorry for the fight that we had. And sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't."
6205,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. So you kind of find yourself when you're in that bind trying to find ways of, of getting, getting what you need met, and, yeah."
6206,high_121,client,"Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. Yeah. So I don't know to do this. I mean I don't know what to do next. I'm not very good at it."
6207,high_121,counsellor,"I just wanna say we, we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you. But I just want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate, how hard this is to be able to talk about it and it's, it's not an easy situation and you're definitely not alone and I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it."
6208,high_121,client,Thanks. It's really hard to.
6209,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. I know. There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are, that, that many women in very similar situations find themselves. And things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and figure out what, if anything, that you want to do differently or how to, what your next step might be."
6210,high_121,client,Okay.
6211,high_121,counsellor,"And, and, some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship. You've mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it's, can be really good and then he can be gone for a while, and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that. We can certainly talk about resources, about the resources in the community that may be there for you or in terms of your own understanding, but also if you are in need of additional help we can talk about those."
6212,high_121,client,Oh.
6213,high_121,counsellor,"We can talk about safety planning, I mean one of the, one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and, and your baby safe. And we can talk about that. We can talk about finances. You mentioned you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now."
6214,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6215,high_121,counsellor,"We can certainly explore that a little bit more. Taking care of yourself, which-"
6216,high_121,client,Yeah right.
6217,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, yeah. For many, many new, new moms, that's hard under any circumstances, to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy. So that's certainly something we can talk about. And also, just the whole issue about taking care of your child, and, and your, your mothering, your parenting. How you might, how you might, focus on that and, in this situation."
6218,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6219,high_121,counsellor,Or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front just to start with.
6220,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6221,high_121,counsellor,What do you think?
6222,high_121,client,"Well, it, it's it's funny, as you're showing me this, I, I've been thinking that all I've been doing is focusing on the baby, and being a good mom, and and, and yet, I'm also trying to think about getting a job, and I don't know how those two, fit together. And even as I'm just saying that out loud, I'm not even talking about taking care of him, which is weird that I'm not even. When I look at this, these circles I, I'm looking at mothering and children and finances and that seems to be important, yet I'm spend, I spend so much time thinking about him all the time. And right now I'm not."
6223,high_121,counsellor,"Mm-hm. So maybe y, y, you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with w, w, what it, where, what it means and where it is."
6224,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6225,high_121,counsellor,"And now you are kinda think well maybe I oughta think about some other things and see where I might go with those. These things, if, if, a job and taking, learning how to be a better mother and might be might help the relationship so that might be. So it might be a way of focusing on how, how you might be able to take care of yourself. Get, get a job or look at the possibility of doing that, and the same time trying to incorporate your, taking care of your child. Tho, those things might help you and might free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship. What to do about the relationship."
6226,high_121,client,"Yeah, what to do about the relationship. I'm not sure what to do with the relationship."
6227,high_121,counsellor,"Mm-hm. And, you know, you, you're the only one that, that really will know about that. About the dealing with the relationship. About what, when the timing is right for any decision that you make, one way or the other."
6228,high_121,client,I don't even know what to think about that. I don't know how to.
6229,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6230,high_121,client,I don't feel like I can make any decisions.
6231,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. Well, and it sounds like you'd like to think about making some decisions in other areas and, and, when you think about. Was that, was that right? Would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job. Is that something you'd like to talk about?"
6232,high_121,client,Yeah. And how to balance that with being a mom at the same time cuz that sounds really hard.
6233,high_121,counsellor,"Well, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work-"
6234,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6235,high_121,counsellor,"When, after the baby was born. What, what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that and, and, and thinking about, thinking about that? What have you thought about?"
6236,high_121,client,"Well, I guess I think initially that I would need his help more. He would need to help take care of the baby. He didn't do that now, so I don't know, and it'd be kind of scary, that, I don't know what that would look like. So I would have to find some other help to get, to be able to go to work, even just part time."
6237,high_121,counsellor,Mm-hm.
6238,high_121,client,"So, I've got to get some child care or something."
6239,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. So you might have to explore some other options for the child care and, and other ways of taking care of the, the baby so that you would be still okay about going back to work."
6240,high_121,client,Yeah.
6241,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6242,high_121,client,Yeah. Somebody I trusted.
6243,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, yeah."
6244,high_121,client,"And I'd have to figure out, just the timing of that and a job that would fit a schedule where I could still, breastfeed and help her with her naps and make sure that I'm there for bedtime and all those important times. But make enough money that it was worthwhile to do it."
6245,high_121,counsellor,"To, yeah, to be out and working and paying somebody. That sounds like a lot."
6246,high_121,client,Yeah.
6247,high_121,counsellor,"It really does sound, though, like you, you're really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things, the basic needs, and really taking care of your child at the same time."
6248,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6249,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, yeah."
6250,high_121,client,It's very important to me.
6251,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6252,high_121,client,"I didn't think I was, I wanted to have children and then we did so I would like him to be a daddy in that, wow, just realized I was thinking about him not being around as a daddy and I'm not really sure what to do with that."
6253,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6254,high_121,client,"But the babe, the baby is the most important thing right. I didn't realize that, I'd spend so much time thinking about him all the time. And when is he gonna be back and does he love us and why the heck did he do that, that weird thing and why does he care about these other things that he cares about."
6255,high_121,counsellor,Being jealous and not wanting you to have friends.
6256,high_121,client,"Yeah, why does he. And it has nothing to do with what I'm thinking about now, which is the baby and, huh."
6257,high_121,counsellor,"But it's, you've mentioned that a couple times now that it's, that it sort of surprises you. The way you're thinking about it and the way you're approaching it. Like, you, you're recognizing or seeing that you have spent a lot of time really agonizing over, over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship, or what it really means. You've spent a lot of time there. That kinda surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently."
6258,high_121,client,"Mm-hm, agonizing. I guess that's what I've been doing. I feel like I've just been hoping and wishing and it seems like all my focus is always. So, when the baby's crying, I'm, I'm worrying about him, and, and and I so the baby crying is, is just, it's hard. But but if, just now talking about it, letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing. That I could actually think about why the baby is crying, as opposed to why is why is he not returning my calls or why did he give me that look when I, you know, talked about getting a job and things like that. It's not, so. Interesting."
6259,high_121,counsellor,"So, you're realizing too, how much it really takes to focus attention on the baby and to be able to do it and it's like I, I, I it's hard to do both."
6260,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6261,high_121,counsellor,It's hard to really think about doing both.
6262,high_121,client,I need his help with that.
6263,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6264,high_121,client,I don't need to be worrying about him too. I don't understand what safety planning means.
6265,high_121,counsellor,"Well, one of the things that we, we look at is trying to help people who are in, in a situation similar to you. Where, where there might be some, where there might be some fear about something that could, that might happen, or you know. And I know you said he, he, he had indicated that he wouldn't do it again. But sometimes it really helps people to feel, to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe if that's what needs to happen. So if he kinda got that weird look in his eye again which, actually, I've seen before, but he just never really did anything like this before."
6266,high_121,client,Mm-hm. It just went farther this time.
6267,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, okay so like if I recognize, if I saw that look, what to do? Is that?"
6268,high_121,client,"Yeah,"
6269,high_121,counsellor,"yeah and, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know there might be places that you can go to, to get safe. There might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe. Or make sure that the baby's safe. Or people to call, or thing, just things that you can do based on what your life is like and what you, what resources you have available to you."
6270,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6271,high_121,counsellor,Is that something you're interested in really exploring?
6272,high_121,client,"Sounds kinda freaky to think that I would have to keep myself safe from somebody that says he loves me and, you know, loves the baby. Sounds a little strange."
6273,high_121,counsellor,Mm-hm. Some ways it just seems like it shouldn't have to be that way.
6274,high_121,client,"No, it shouldn't have to be that way. But it, I didn't expect him to do what he did either, so. That kinda came out of nowhere."
6275,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. It really took you by surprise. It's something that you're just trying to figure out where. How does this fit and what, what does it mean?"
6276,high_121,client,Yeah.
6277,high_121,counsellor,And what do I do with it
6278,high_121,client,Yeah.
6279,high_121,counsellor,"How do I, how do I respond to this"
6280,high_121,client,Yeah.
6281,high_121,counsellor,Yeah.
6282,high_121,client,"It doesn't seem real. So I guess, thinking about, thinking about that kind of makes sense ahead of time."
6283,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah. Well, let me see if I, if I got it all, and then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that. And I wanna make sure I, I understand a little bit about your situation."
6284,high_121,client,Okay.
6285,high_121,counsellor,"And, this, first of all, this is the first time you've come in. This is the first time that you've had something that really happened, this incident that happened where he pushed you really, prompted you to, to take some steps. Because it's scared you."
6286,high_121,client,Mm hm.
6287,high_121,counsellor,"Mm-hm. You have this relationship that's been kinda off and on and but he's been very supportive and helpful in terms of giving you, meeting your basic needs and the baby's basic needs and wants to take care of you."
6288,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6289,high_121,counsellor,"And, and there are times when it's really good. And there are times when you've been less sure. And this is, this incident has also made you kind of think about that."
6290,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6291,high_121,counsellor,"Some of the ways that you've been thinking about or, or thinking about it now kind of surprises you. But you're looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit. So that you can have more financial independence, if you will, or be able to take care of yourself for those times when you need to."
6292,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6293,high_121,counsellor,And you're starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe. Did that kind of get it all?
6294,high_121,client,"That, yeah, that kind of captures it all. I'm not yes, yeah. I don't know. I don't know where to start."
6295,high_121,counsellor,"Mm-hm, mm-hm."
6296,high_121,client,But I guess that's why I'm talking to you.
6297,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, yeah. So, maybe we can, we can take that next step and, and and. When, when, when we get together again and we can do that. We can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those, in both of those areas."
6298,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6299,high_121,counsellor,"For keeping yourself safe. And, and for, you know, looking at the possibilities. Cuz there are options and resources out there should you choose to, to, to make the decision to go back to work."
6300,high_121,client,Mm-hm.
6301,high_121,counsellor,There are some options for you.
6302,high_121,client,"So, there's like a good, somebody can help me work on my resume or something like that?"
6303,high_121,counsellor,"Yeah, there, there are other options for, for, for a variety of things and we can make some, have some discussions about that."
6304,high_121,client,"Okay, okay."
6305,high_121,counsellor,How does that sound?
6306,high_121,client,That sounds good. That'd be nice.
6307,high_121,counsellor,"Well, I, I really appreciate again your coming in today. And we will follow up with this conversation and in you, you will have,"
6308,high_122,client,I'm doing okay yeah you know things have been settling down a bit I think
6309,high_122,counsellor,yeah the last time we saw things were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the hot discharged from the hospital about a week ago
6310,high_122,client,yeah
6311,high_122,counsellor,yes here how's your injury?
6312,high_122,client,it's it's um pretty pain you know had a lot of pain in it I've been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and just kind of trying to keep busy and focus on things that are happening I've been busy with my church duties and with my kids
6313,high_122,counsellor,and you've been trying to stay
6314,high_122,client,but yeah yeah it's been hard to think about myself when I have so many other things that are more play more important than me to deal with
6315,high_122,counsellor,how are your kids doing?
6316,high_122,client,they're doing okay you know the little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when I first got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what was going to happen but the older the older kids have helped out quite a bit so I think they're pulling together
6317,high_122,counsellor,yeah I imagine that there's some you know a period of readjustment and healing and sadness or as in it sounds like also just trying to get things done
6318,high_122,client,yeah I mean my motto is just to keep moving you know moving as fast as I can I'm trying to give you know keep the house clean and be good you know with my duties with my church and trying to keep the kids focused on their activities and not to be too focused on what's happening in me and Paul's life because you know there's nothing they can do about that
6319,high_122,counsellor,so you're you're taking care of a lot of people your community your kids all the while trying to take care of yourself that's a lot
6320,high_122,client,yeah
6321,high_122,counsellor,"I really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you have going on. Yeah, well, you know last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe. I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about."
6322,high_122,client,no I you know I made time today to talk about this I think it's really important to try to figure something out things got very out of hand there and so it's it's I'm looking forward to thinking about what what things I can do see
6323,high_122,counsellor,so so you were scared sounds like you were scared it was terrifying
6324,high_122,client,I mean we police were called you know we ended up having to call the police him and Paul was arrested and spent some time in jail I had child welfare folks crawling all over my house and my mom was upset and neighbors were all being nosey and gozman and it's it's it was just very scary so so a lot of things were turned upside down
6325,high_122,counsellor,and when you say it was scary I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive
6326,high_122,client,right I mean it was you know we had people coming to the house Colin and you know checking in are you okay or can you get a restraining order and my mom was trying to get me to move in with her and you know it's just too many you know too many cooks in the kitchen
6327,high_122,counsellor,so a lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing
6328,high_122,client,yeah yeah so I'm just really i'm not i'm not going to do that i'm not gonna get a restraining order i'm not going to call the police you know he knows where I live
6329,high_122,counsellor,and so say more about that say more about why you why you don't want to call the police or you don't want to get a restraining order?
6330,high_122,client,they were they were throwing him on the ground they were holding his arms behind his back and and they had their guns and you know that kind of you never know what the police are going to do to a black man you never know whether he's going to make it to the jail safely so I was I was terrified for him and then the next day you know child welfare call in the house
6331,high_122,counsellor,it sounds like that was a very scary experience in moment for you
6332,high_122,client,yeah because I'm a good mom
6333,high_122,counsellor,and given that experience your tells like your partner maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again
6334,high_122,client,yeah yeah no I've told my mom that that's you know that's a last resort and that I'm gonna be meeting with some folks and thinking about other options
6335,high_122,counsellor,and that's what you'd like to talk about today the alternatives to calling the police
6336,high_122,client,absolutely
6337,high_122,counsellor,what have you thought about so far? what other ideas do you have about? what you might do in a serious moment where you're scared?
6338,high_122,client,mm-hmm for your your well-being and that of your kids I think I'm most afraid you know that something might happen that will be really crazy and really out of control and so I've been thinking about what kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control and I just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my Minister about it came to my mind because he's somebody who we've talked to before
6339,high_122,counsellor,okay yeah so your Minister someone that you're thinking about talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship what are your thoughts what would you what would you say to your Minister what would you like to tell your minister
6340,high_122,client,I'm really I'm really interested in telling him more of the truth of what's happening in my relationship. he doesn't know about he has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me and they starting to kill himself in the children. he knows we've had some marital problems some financial problems. he knows that Paul's had some drinking problems so there's some of that. but he doesn't know about him threatening to kill us or that he's been hitting me or his rages. so I feel like if you know that it's time to tell the minute you know tell him some of that stuff. you feel like you've been keeping some significant information from your
6341,high_122,counsellor,what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things what might be some advantages are reasons to do that
6342,high_122,client,he's been helpful before he's really helped us a lot we've we've had counseling with him over the last five years numerous times and he's been very helpful so it's someone that you trust someone who have a relationship with and he's been helpful in what ways has he been helpful you know I think Paul respects him as a man and I think he cares about Paul so he's not you know my mom and my dad and my friends they they're really bordering on hating Paul and we don't I don't feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him but my pastor has some objective attea and I think he cares about Paul
6343,high_122,counsellor,it sounds like your pastor is able to see him as a whole complicated human being in the same ways that that you do perhaps that there's this side of him that's scary and that you don't like and then there's this other aspect of him that you you really do appreciate and and you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well what would be another reason to talk to your pastor in addition to this being someone you trust and that Paul might listen to what would might be another
6344,high_122,client,well I don't think that he's going to likely go storming into you know our pastor's house Paul oh that Paul won't you know he's gonna heal he comes banging at my mom's door and he kills you know storming over to my girlfriend's house but he's not likely to do that
6345,high_122,counsellor,um yeah I don't think you will so so so your pastor's home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go
6346,high_122,client,right should things cool off because things got so out of control and crazy you know and that's not going to happen again
6347,high_122,counsellor,so you've said that a few times now that things got so out of control and crazy tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that was
6348,high_122,client,you know you know my eldest son got involved my arm was was up was harmed things were broken he threatened to kill me and he threatened to kill all of us and I had to call the police and I had to you know have people coming into my house tromping through my house grab and Paul hurting him you know he called me from jail
6349,high_122,counsellor,and how can you do this you know what have you done
6350,high_122,client,you know I felt like what have I done how can I do this right
6351,high_122,counsellor,so so not only was it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children but afterwards it was scary as well because of all the things that all that fallout yeah so so so going to your pastors talking to your pastor possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantages are there any disadvantages like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what's been going on in your relationship that Paul will now you know if he finds out that
6352,high_122,client,"I've talked to our minister about this you know. I have no doubt how angry he will be. So this could really be a trigger, a significant trigger, yes, if he finds out about it."
6353,high_122,counsellor,yeah so that's a little bit of a difficult situation
6354,high_122,client,yeah
6355,high_122,counsellor,as you think about this particular part of a safety plan on the one hand there's potentially some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister and at the same time there's this possible significant risk when you think about you know the pros and the cons and in the situation what do you what do you make of that what do you where do you go with that
6356,high_122,client,it's it's a risk I'm willing to take you know I have thought about this and it was you know things got so out of control and I feel like it's time to do something different and to think about how we're going to do this differently
6357,high_122,counsellor,you're you're really concerned
6358,high_122,client,yeah
6359,high_122,counsellor,a part of you is really worried about the next time and you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning and you you also feel like it's a risk that you're you're willing to take given what is at stake and really it sounds like you feel like your life and your children's lives may be at stake
6360,high_122,client,yes you know I think that things can't continue the way that they are I have to figure out something that's going to work for me and for my kids and for Paul would it be all right with you if I offered just a suggestion or thought? something to think about in terms of kids and say planning is something that I know other moms in a similar situation similar to yours have done and that is sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a safe person to either call more run to in the moment when things are if things get really crazy and out of hand I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids well I think my oldest my oldest son that would be a really helpful thing for him because he wants to know what he can do he wants to do something he's always jumping in that's how I got her in the first place is he was jumping in so helping him identify something that he can do that will keep us safe and to keep him safe we would be a great idea
6361,high_122,counsellor,yeah you so you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violent situation but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it without when he learned done yeah he's becoming a man now too he he needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe yeah and as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you you're also really concerned about protecting him and gives him safe and I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do and things that you feel like you actually do have control over I've last time we talked you you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul when he's in his fury in his rage and being violent and what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control you can't control him but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to a possibly a safe person you're your Minister
6362,high_122,client,yes
6363,high_122,counsellor,and having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and and then the other pieces may be having a conversation with your oldest child at least about who to call in the moment
6364,high_122,client,yeah
6365,high_122,counsellor,and I'm confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any any way that I can and if it's at all helpful i'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more
6366,high_122,client,thank you i'd appreciate that
6367,high_122,counsellor,thanks for your time
6368,high_122,client,thank you
6369,high_123,client,thank you
6370,high_123,counsellor,how are you
6371,high_123,client,I'm feeling pretty intense things have kind of gone downhill since I was here last time
6372,high_123,counsellor,well I'm sorry to hear that
6373,high_123,client,yeah I know
6374,high_123,counsellor,last time we talked um you and Kelly had just gotten engaged and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life so so tell me what has happened what what is what's shifted
6375,high_123,client,I think that we've just sort of fallen back you know. I was really hopeful that you know what the proposal also came the the promise to you know work on the relationship and work on her anger and work on you know being the couple that we we hope to be. and that it's not happening. it's not happening. we're right back to where we were.
6376,high_123,counsellor,"I'm sorry to hear that. I know you were you're excited. You were feeling hopeful for change. I don't get that same sense from you right now. In fact, it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless."
6377,high_123,client,yeah about situation
6378,high_123,counsellor,well how can I may how can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now?
6379,high_123,client,i just i don't i don't know how to make change i don't know how to I don't know how to end this i don't know how to get out i don't know how to I just I can't do it anymore so you've decided to make a change and in fact it sounds like you've decided to leave the relationship I don't know I I mean I want to I don't want to be in it but I don't I don't know how to get to not being in it
6380,high_123,counsellor,so you're thinking about it it's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship but correct me if I'm wrong what you're saying is you want to make a change and you don't want this relationship as it is
6381,high_123,client,yeah
6382,high_123,counsellor,now what when you think about changing what what ideas i mean i guess you mentioned leaving what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like
6383,high_123,client,I don't know it just feels so overwhelming when I think about it I just I can't seem to find a way out of it and that feels feels ethical feels like it and you know I don't want to hurt her I just don't want to be in this relationship anymore
6384,high_123,counsellor,why don't you want to be in this relationship anymore?
6385,high_123,client,it's not healthy it's I'm not happy I can't imagine that she's happy even though she says she is it's you know we're fighting constantly I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her she's overprotective she yeah it just doesn't feel right
6386,high_123,counsellor,you just doesn't feel right it doesn't feel right
6387,high_123,client,yeah
6388,high_123,counsellor,and so um so what would feel right?
6389,high_123,client,oh that's a huge question hmm I just don't I'm not sure just this isn't right
6390,high_123,counsellor,so the way things are is not right it's not working you don't feel supported this isn't the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be
6391,high_123,client,yeah I mean when we started it was was lovely she is amazing she was this super caring and thoughtful woman and you know we were lots of same interests you know same friends it's you know she was just fantastic and I don't know I don't know where that changed and I feel like we did this on-again off-again stuff and it's just it just seems to like just not right and I know I know I'm don't deserve to be treated this way I know that I'm I'm better than that
6392,high_123,counsellor,mm-hmm you really value your self and your well-being and in your spirit and it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and even though things started out well they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself no but you know but she's lovely
6393,high_123,client,and I love her and I can't imagine I can't imagine my life without her in it
6394,high_123,counsellor,mm-hmm so you're feeling torn
6395,high_123,client,yeah
6396,high_123,counsellor,you're you're torn between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself and you've got a lot of mixed feelings and you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like you're able to kind of hold that complexity if you will that you've got these strong feelings for this person and you don't feel like this is the a good relationship for you know
6397,high_123,client,I think it's good for either one of us
6398,high_123,counsellor,mhm for both of you
6399,high_123,client,yeah
6400,high_123,counsellor,well so so then you've talked a little bit about leaving
6401,high_123,client,I mean
6402,high_123,counsellor,tell me more about what you've thought about and when you think about making a change in terms of leaving what might that look like for you
6403,high_123,client,I don't know I mean it feels I just can't imagine my life without her in it so the idea of not having her there feels really scary and the idea of staying the way it is and things not changing feels even scarier so I don't I don't know how to and I don't even know how I would do that our lives are so intertwined I mean my business our friends are the queer community is so small you know that's my fam those are as much as my friends and my family as well and so just you know
6404,high_123,counsellor,how do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way
6405,high_123,client,you know for me like in a way that I feel I'm doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself
6406,high_123,counsellor,what what thoughts do you have about how you do that how do extract yourself how might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace as you said
6407,high_123,client,i don't i don't even know I mean talk to my friend Jay about it and I don't know he suggested like a break but I don't know I just don't want to get caught in that on again off again before like you know like we've done before but the idea of a break feels a little less I don't know maybe more gentle
6408,high_123,counsellor,mm-hmm
6409,high_123,client,I don't I don't know same or a little more gentle I don't know how to give us both time to really think about it and and I don't know maybe maybe she'll change maybe maybe if I'm you know if this is it if this is it like if this break is it maybe maybe she'll be able to change
6410,high_123,counsellor,mm-hmm I heard you say that live you know moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary in fact it's almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier and I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that
6411,high_123,client,it's just I feel exhausted i feel like i'm not i'm not who I was when I came into this relationship I feel like I'm constantly struggling to make her happy and that just doesn't work there's nothing I can do and I feel like I've lost my joy
6412,high_123,counsellor,mm-hmm
6413,high_123,client,and I don't know I'm just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place where I feel like I'm falling apart
6414,high_123,counsellor,mm-hmm
6415,high_123,client,my peace
6416,high_123,counsellor,yeah so you're concerned about your own well-being in your own joy and your your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change and that's the part that's really scary for you
6417,high_123,client,yeah
6418,high_123,counsellor,you mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break and you said that that was a scary thought for you and I guess I'd like to hear more our additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you
6419,high_123,client,well I'd it seems like I mean if it could happen if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about like what I want and what I need and and you know I feel like I can't sort out what's me in this anymore and and so like if I had that space just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while I don't know it seems like that would be helpful
6420,high_123,counsellor,it sounds like you're feeling like you're so in in it just so in the the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to see out of it and an advantage a reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence if you will that sense of not knowing
6421,high_123,client,yeah
6422,high_123,counsellor,well if you don't mind I'd love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here I just kind of wrote this down really quickly but on a scale of 0 to 10 being not motivated at all and 10 being extremely motivated how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now
6423,high_123,client,Oh like somewhat motivated yeah
6424,high_123,counsellor,why is six and not a one
6425,high_123,client,cuz I know it needs I need it I feel like I'm losing myself so I feel like it's as important
6426,high_123,counsellor,yeah well so so why I six and not a nine or ten
6427,high_123,client,cuz I'm not sure how to make it happen
6428,high_123,counsellor,hmm yeah
6429,high_123,client,I don't I don't know
6430,high_123,counsellor,so it's important to you and you're not maybe fully confident or sure about how the how part yeah make it home exactly well kind of following up on that on a scale of  to   not confident at all ten being extremely confident how confident are you that if you decided to take a break from relationship with Kelly you would be successful at making that happen
6431,high_123,client,oh I don't know maybe like a three or four
6432,high_123,counsellor,okay so so less confident you're a little less confident than you are motivated why a three and not a zero
6433,high_123,client,because I I'm on it I mean I do it's something I want
6434,high_123,counsellor,mm-hmm and so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen why a three and not an eight or a nine
6435,high_123,client,I I can't control her I don't know how she would react and I just don't want any more arguments and anger and yeah and I don't hurt her
6436,high_123,counsellor,so when you think about taking this break you're also thinking about how shy she might respond and what she might do and that creates a whole other kind of set of worries and it undermines your sense of confidence on some level
6437,high_123,client,it creates a lot of anxiety for me
6438,high_123,counsellor,yeah what do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break
6439,high_123,client,I think I like maybe a plan like just knowing knowing what the rules are sort of like where where where I want to go with it and and what I'm hope I don't know what I want to accomplish
6440,high_123,counsellor,so thinking through an actual plan like what you would say how long what the boundaries are might might help you
6441,high_123,client,yeah regard
6442,high_123,counsellor,okay and then one final question on a scale of 1 to 10 being not ready at all and 10 being extremely ready how ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break and that let's say the next couple of weeks
6443,high_123,client,hey Nate Nate yeah
6444,high_123,counsellor,so so pretty ready
6445,high_123,client,yeah
6446,high_123,counsellor,and and you've spoken to this already a little bit i believe but I'll ask you again why an eight and not on a one or two
6447,high_123,client,because I know if I just let it drag out that I'm gonna be miserable
6448,high_123,counsellor,so your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know that you need to do for yourself and if you don't things are not going to get any better and that that makes you both motivated and even more ready well why why an eight and not a
6449,high_123,client,lets you know scary change is hard and thinking about not being with the woman I thought I was gonna marry bits that makes me sad
6450,high_123,counsellor,so your emotions your sense of maybe sadness and in grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness and in some way sort of giving up on a dream
6451,high_123,client,yeah
6452,high_123,counsellor,and so another aspect of enter your whole experience is that you're you're grieving mm-hmm the really should should be isn't even over yet but you're grieving the dream and the hopes that you had and that's a that's a heaviness and certainly a factor in and what you do next
6453,high_123,client,yeah
6454,high_123,counsellor,well if I could take just a moment and make sure I've captured and understood everything you've shared with me and I I know this is really difficult to talk about so I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this has been like for you you've been feeling stuck and things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you realizing that Kelly's not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations in your dreams in a lot of different regards you know that you need to make a change you want to make a change and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change you know it's what you want to do it's the right thing for you and you still really care and love Kelly and you're also concerned kind of on an outer level about your business about your community about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup in order to make this more manageable you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change like taking a small break as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you're pretty ready you're somewhat you know you're motivated and it may be a little less confident but you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan that that might help you feel more confident
6455,high_123,client,yeah
6456,high_123,counsellor,and that's certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if that's all right with you I'd be happy to hear your ideas maybe even share some suggestions with you about a possible plan that big daddy
6457,high_123,client,all right yeah yeah thank you
6458,high_123,counsellor,thank you very much for your time live
6459,high_123,client,I really appreciate
6460,high_124,client,i member you good
6461,high_124,counsellor,so i received the email referral from your school on your university housing office contacted me but incident you had providing alcohol I'm really glad to see you here a lot of regular referrals from what doctors offices counselors and schools of this and a lot of people are a little hesitant at first step it's a little scary so I wanna commend you for coming in here taking that first step it's awesome so what brings you today
6462,high_124,client,well I've had alcohol in my room a few times and my roommate miss whole University I think on me so I've had a couple meetings with them and I guess they got since it was so many times and it's still occurring that maybe I had a problem and needs chopped someone about it
6463,high_124,counsellor,okay how many times have you seen your housing staff
6464,high_124,client,with all the zone probably about three times stop their job yeah cuz every time they moan referred to by your living yes it has um maybe my roommate used to be pretty close and then I lost my brother recently and I'm kind of abusing alcohol to do with that and I don't feel like she understands that like she's tried she tried to be there for me in the beginning like you know friends are but I kind of push her away because she doesn't understand that they are all bringing ski of pain that feel however that I was pretty close
6465,high_124,counsellor,I'm very sorry to hear about your loss um I know it's hard to lose someone you love and so you might be using alcohol is a means to cope with that how are you processing your feelings?
6466,high_124,client,I am and because of that I kind of stopped going to class so I think that's another reason that line / my mom really loves before we were this is my second year at school and we became friends last ready to ring together this year and things are going great in the beginning we had this core group of friends and that we would go out on the weekend and we wouldn't let it affect anything and then after all my brother I have just went downhill from there and alcohol just became like I said it hope you mechanism to help me deal with it the pain of that loss and I think that is surely
6467,high_124,counsellor,okay so human using alcohols it means to go with your brother and I hear that you have been missing class how often will probably come to me to say to use this class and I Prime Minister's very kind to me so I'm sure that's a little bit of stress for you
6468,high_124,client,oh yeah I pay for college of my own um and without going to class my grades if I'd fallen and I do get a scholarship that helped me a little bit and if my grades fall below a certain GPA and I lose that scholarship and redundant we're getting close so that definitely add some stress
6469,high_124,counsellor,okay well first good job for you for paying for school on your own that's really tough I know it's really expensive so that's great and it's good thing that you're working towards education here here you trying you know it's hard to do loss so maybe you could just think of some other ways that you can like cook what the lungs how would you say the typical an eye out with your practicing
6470,high_124,client,um well i usually get up around noon and then i'll go to lunch with some of my friends and then i'll come back and take a nap because I thing out really late that I'm four and then I'll get up and shower and get ready there's an eye out although out about nine o'clock sometimes they even go along because my friends don't want to go with me so weak they also three or four blocks and then I six through my alarm in the morning and don't make it class so I don't miss coughing purpose it's just as I through my alarm and then don't get up until around noon if I then x-men suppose my closet so there's no point really going to the other one so so then I knew it all over him right which I mean I understand your chums loves and scene and you have a lot one on
6471,high_124,counsellor,It sounds like with lots of your brother and have fingers on your own and trying to maintain a good GPA with class through other ways. Have you seen alcohol negatively affect early?
6472,high_124,client,well I've lost a few other friends besides just my roommate I have kind of a new corporate group that some of the ones that I went out with my remaining a curly around anymore away as well because they don't under they also don't understand the drinking so a lot of lost friendships obviously my braids in my GPA and also with paying for school I just have a job on campus and I don't make much money um and right now all that money is going towards to alcohol that apply so financial stress is definitely a big one
6473,high_124,counsellor,so you can have a gift straight to your using alcohol to see if the stress so you can think of watching your own but not all can be pretty expensive
6474,high_124,client,yeah it's a definitely is expensive for ages
6475,high_124,counsellor,um ok so maybe we can think of some ways that you can be stressed without alcohol um can you think of any ways that you could do that?
6476,high_124,client,um well I really like working out so I think going to the gym could help a little bit and reading I kind of like it often books and I haven't really used that as a way to cope with this because being with a thing that me and my brother kind of just gathered but I'm going to a point where I think that maybe I can start reading me Danny get less than that is going out I do enjoy I do think I might so go out with my friends on weekends and that's something that I can start doing with my roommate again I just don't want it to that or to become a problem like it had with my forwardness
6477,high_124,counsellor,right maybe so maybe when you go out and friends you can find a way to control your is those pom-poms images
6478,high_124,client,yes and I can also talk to them about what okay
6479,high_124,counsellor,well I really think your idea of working out it's a great one I know that a lot of my other clients have tried it it seems great results not only will it help me destress but it will all be like you happy release some endorphins and i'll keep you fit so that will probably want me to shreds yeah I hope so great so you refer to me by your university housing office right off of all infraction um you've been dealing with the loss of your brother and financial stress of school and worry about your friends so would you like to take a few steps to take control of your key?
6480,high_124,client,I definitely think that I need to take some such source control me
6481,high_124,counsellor,great so in what ways would you like to do that
6482,high_124,client,um well I think definitely the two other things that I've talked about helping me to deal with stress and then I think just coming out things especially like if I slip up and go out and in this class I think besides I want to talk to you about that i think would help and then sing maybe you every two weeks or something great talk about
6483,high_124,counsellor,I think that's a great plan so would you like to maybe schedule an appointment for the twisting company and there's great selfie right I will see you then Kelly
6484,high_124,client,thank you so much i have a great day
6485,high_125,client,um I'm okay I just want to like let you know that I know that I have to be here every day this week and I know that this is important but I think I'm going to get here because my car towed and my has a marshal time so I don't know how in the world I'm going to get here so I just want to let you know that up front
6486,high_125,counsellor,okay thank you thank you for that and first of all welcome to the Hope Center it kind of sounds like looking at your file that this isn't going to be a place where you can get the help that you need should you choose to come weekly so I understand getting your car impounded is a difficult situation thank you for letting me know that and would you like to tell me a little bit about how that occurred in fact why you're here
6487,high_125,client,um well basically I was leaving a friend's house and I are pulled over for speeding and the officers no leave my car and so he calls come out and searched and I had a little weight my car so it got impounded I got arrested and i got charged with missing error from the session and place them a lot of on probation so part of my probation and the others on here my husband is that i have to complete this program so that's why I'm here
6488,high_125,counsellor,it's very difficult i'm sure for you be here first of all and second of all it sounds like a lot has occurred so you were arrested after being stopped that can be difficult as well having a dog search your car that's very tough to deal with so we arrested you went to court it does sound like though the judge was kind of lenient that works out for you in fact i'm assuming that if you complete treatment that won't go on your criminal record so that's probably good it also sounds like you're a little concerned about them now your husband might feel about this situation
6489,high_125,client,yeah I mean he's trying to say now that this unfit parent because I got arrested and I mean I've never had my kids have never wanted for anything I've always I go to work every single day I paying the bills I'm there I cook dinner every night in my opinion I don't really feel like marijuana has ever stopped me from doing anything in our life yes I know it's illegal but I don't feel like it's a problem I don't feel like I'm this addict that he's trying to pin me fee you know I just make this all kind of crap honestly I don't have any other problems and I don't know if like me to be here
6490,high_125,counsellor,I totally understand that and it sounds like now your husband just is watching you you have a judge watching you and you're on probation. But it also sounds like you care about your family and sounds like in your mind and perhaps your vestments you're a great mother. You provide for your children they're well fed their well cared for and this is the only probably been it before. So I can see where you might not think that this is this is a problem for you.
6491,high_125,client,I mean I don't think you know this is something that has never affected my life so I don't feel like you know I should have to go through a treatment facility what I don't believe to like have a problem understand
6492,high_125,counsellor,well let me ask you this would you mind telling me about maybe how much you smoke every day and what typical day with or without pot just left for you
6493,high_125,client,well i mean i usually wake up in the morning and i get my kid tiger school and I send them off to school and then I smoke a bowl and I get ready for work and so I mean I'm not like super high when i get to work I just like knock the edge off in the morning it gets me motivated you know I go to work and I have a really high stress job you have an accountant I an S I have to sit by Manu Peter all day long like crunching numbers and if I don't do something when I would die if I have to sit in this cubicle all day so you know after work you know I come home and I take care of the kids I make sure that you know they're fed they're bathe you know we do story time they go to bed and then I spoke about quite a bit help me sleep but you know other than that I mean I'm a smoke with my friends on the weekends because that's what we do you know we don't drink alcohol I mean that's stupid we don't drink and drive from we just you know me and you know so cold and hang out and you know with each other and I mean that's just what we've done for years in the oven so that'sthat's years old you know now
6494,high_125,counsellor,so it sounds like wait is this in fact quite a large part of your life your social circles those folks that you hang out with they do that as well as part of your daily routine but it also sounds like you're responsible in that you have a very good job but it's also stressful it is normal for people to look for ways to destress when we come home every day and also to take the edge off as you said morning but it also sounds like you're still making sure you're taking care of your kids that they're fed before they go off to school sounds like there's a lot going on with weed and in your life let me ask you this do you remember a time when you before you were or time as an adult even that you didn't smoke weed and what life was like for you then
6495,high_125,client,yeah when I first married my husband he didn't like it and you know I told him that it wasn't something that I was addicted to and so I'm stop me from watching and he basically said well why don't you stop now and I was like sure why not i'll stop so the first leg two years we were married I didn't smoke at all and then you know life happens me like almost lost her house he lost his job and I just got really stressed out and I just wanted to smoke and he understood because you know it was a really stressful time for both of us and he like didn't say anything about it and so for years now he hasn't said anything about it until now right
6496,high_125,counsellor,so it sounds like you're able to communicate with your husband about your your drug use and nice either understood that or not you decided as a couple that you would stop and and then you started back again so do you see now that may be there there might be an issue with with smoking
6497,high_125,client,I mean obviously I mean I don't think so but I mean like I want my husband to you know be proud of me and I don't want to be here you know I think this is embarrassing to have to come treatment for so I mean yeah I understand there are you know consequences but you know I just don't I just don't think it's fair
6498,high_125,counsellor,right if I can ask you or just let you know and I'm sure you know now there are certain risks when you when you use drugs see you might get caught and you mentioned it earlier that you don't drink and drive but do you see that do you see difference between being high and driving maybe on your way to work in the morning if you smoked a bowl and then perhaps having a couple drinks and drive it to work
6499,high_125,client,I mean I feel like I'd refine when I smoke but I mean there have been times where you know I kind of daze out when I was driving or and I didn't really remember where I was at and then I didn't it was by exit. I was like oh wow I just like completely forgot minutes of driving no so I mean yeah I think it I think it could be dangerous but I feel like I have a good tolerance. Like I feel like I could I feel like I'm
6500,high_125,counsellor,okay right so what I've heard it before and what I'm hearing from renounced your where there is a risk and it's kind of impaired you driving at one point at the same time you probably enjoy smoking it allows you to take the edge off in distress and I understand that let me ask you this if you don't mind would you picture your husband here in the room with us and maybe tell me a little bit about what he would say about your smoking
6501,high_125,client,we did this had in your life still he would tell me you girl out like you would tell me like you have two kids we have two kids we have this life like why do you have to have this thing in your life and and I mean I don't really have an answer for I mean I think it's just something I've always done and you know I don't really know what to do to really change something I've always done
6502,high_125,counsellor,right sounds like a difficult decision and one that perhaps you've made in the past with your husband is a couple because you probably chose that i'm guessing to make sure that you take care of your children it sounds like you're both very loving and responsible parents but there's this one small issue that perhaps as a recurring theme in your life and you enjoy it yet at the same time a thinker sounds like you're aware of the risks that are associated with that though
6503,high_125,client,yeah i mean i know their wrists and you know i don't want to lose my kids you know I don't want this ever to be something that you know my kids are involved in or you know I've been very careful to keep it away from them and I don't want something to happen and then to find something or to you know start using at themselves I mean I don't think there's anything personally wrong with it as an adult now but you know I mean I could have used some guy that sat telling me not to smoke weed well you know hey I would if I don't think there's anything wrong with in it but it would be nice to have had somebody to tell me like don't do that and I don't want my kids to be you know smoking weed and they're getting it they're all
6504,high_125,counsellor,right again it sounds like you're responsible and adolescence is a difficult time and if your children are coming toward that age if they were to see you smoking they could adopt that behavior as well but let me ask you what motivated you to make that change in the past when you and your husband discussed stopping smoking and tell me what that was like just to stop that have you might have done it
6505,high_125,client,um I really had to find ways to like calm down because like I just would get really stressed out i mean i would come home and there's a lot going on um I don't know I think I just you know learn how to deal with my stress better and you know now I feel like you know i don't know if i could but i did before so i'm sure you know i could again
6506,high_125,counsellor,right that sounds like that you're you remember the time when you just stopped and what i heard is that you said you have you found ways to destress with it without the use of marijuana so it sounds like maybe you come you might be willing to make a change again at this point in your life
6507,high_125,client,oh I think I could I mean I just don't want I don't want to be in this position again you know like I want to be with my kids I want to do with my husband I mean I do want to just you know make this go away and start afresh you know
6508,high_125,counsellor,what kind of start like this to be there anymore
6509,high_125,client,so I mean I'm going to do like whatever it takes obvious that's why I'm here to be done with this so I mean yeah I think
6510,high_125,counsellor,so good it sounds like again what I'm hearing is that you are motivated by your children and by the situation perhaps you would like things to be a little smoother between yourself and your husband so think maybe fake down the road let me ask you this where where do you see yourself in a couple of years
6511,high_125,client,yeah we talked about have another kid so we have their child we talked about my thing and you know I see myself what's another baby and moving or to Nashville we talked about there's some good job opportunities out there for him and I so that's kind of where I see ourselves right now
6512,high_125,counsellor,sounds like you have some Union husband both have goals for growing your family tell me tell me what life would love be like as you picture it with two children and a newborn and smoking weed every day
6513,high_125,client,well I don't think it'll be good I don't think it's something that you know I don't want to be like year old something waiting you know I just want to find a way to deal with everything that's going on without having to you know explode good so I mean I don't think it's gonna fit my life anymore
6514,high_125,counsellor,right well again it sounds like you kind of recognizing that it might be time for we to leave your life again so to speak that you have goals and then perhaps that could get in the way and then you don't see that as a part of your life you know in the future so what I'm hearing also is that there's some amazing opportunity for change here and that we can work on that in the future with you so that's how good
6515,high_125,client,okay I'll try great thanks for coming to the hoax
6516,high_125,counsellor,okay Oh Scott is semi sassy today welcome to the Hope Center for true my name is Miss Andrews and I'm here today to just kind of titled it our program and to kind of see why you're here today so for discuss warrior or our program so why don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit why are your name
6517,high_125,client,well first of all i had to get a ride because i can't drive until they give me my license back it's going to be a couple of weeks so it's gonna be hard for me to get here for two weeks and kind of pissed off a little bit about it because i've never been arrested for anything in my life and I got a DUI a few weeks ago and it was my first I never had anything like that happen it's really embarrassing and a kind of pissed at work so but the judge diverted it or there's a diversion whatever however they do that but he said if I come and talk to somebody and get a little outpatient help then we'll go on my record
6518,high_125,counsellor,so it really sounds like you've had a very traumatic experience with this whole situation said you got arrested and then you had to go to court and everything was found a version
6519,high_125,client,yeah traumatic let me tell you the back that police car smelled like vomit I don't know in there before I was it was nasty I've never been in a place like that before it is really really stuck but yeah so I've got the diversion thing going for me I've never done treatment except probably years ago but anyway yeah I really don't see why need to be here at all of a problem with drinking or anything I just got unlucky I got caught everybody drives drunk I just got caught
6520,high_125,counsellor,um I can definitely understand how you feel like they've been singled out you know in this whole situation they were watching you feel like they are watching yeah yeah important people agreeing with these good jobs that's not good what what job do you do tell me about your job
6521,high_125,client,well I was the vice president of an aluminum siding company I know it's really excited but I was the VP so I have this big job right I drove everywhere people watch you and they see the man and said go to the bar after work and then they like wait for him to leave I'm have these small towns are they just look out for you but make really good money the problem is now they're a little embarrassed that this happened you know how about drink with the president of the company sometimes three or four nights a week nothing ever happens to him that happened to me so I don't know what's going on but they're a little embarrassed about this so I don't want to lose my job so that's also kind of why I'm here you know I figured what the heck I'll come talk to you
6522,high_125,counsellor,well it sounds like you really you know you really care about your job and you're very important what you do you know the vice president of this really really great company and you know you feel like this is something that other people do none of the people have company do and it just happens that you got caught this time does that kind of
6523,high_125,client,yeah that's right and you know I'm just a country boy that made a big so to speak you know I just happened to go to school and got lucky and it's not a great company selling aluminum siding is boring as hell let me just tell you there's three colors it's real simple right but you know my wife care about I care about her quite a bit and this is kind of hurt her a little bit too she's not too happy with me in fact I had to sleep out in the camper the other not that wasn't pretty so I'm just saying I willing to you know come here and do this because I want her to be happy with me and they've having lots of money to sell this graph to people so i won't keep doing
6524,high_125,counsellor,it so it sounds like you know you really you really have a reason that you really want to be here you care about your wife can you care about your job and you really like what you do is what I'm hearing right now you're good at it look
6525,high_125,client,yeah I do like it as much as I joke about it it's a good job and the paycheck's nice and the double was beautiful she loves that so I'm just saying you know I want to take care of her she cooks for me every night she takes care of our six kids um got a big family they're getting up in age now in high school they don't need to see this happening to their father
6526,high_125,counsellor,so that sounds like you you know you really care right kids in want them to see you you know in a situation like this in the future
6527,high_125,client,yeah that's about right you could say that you know I'm not getting any younger and you know I've got it's sometimes it's hard if I drink a lot of night to wake up in the morning you know I'm usually on time for every day you know my father always said wake up and be on time for work I'm doing that but you know say it gets harder as you get over to wake up after you've been drinking at night you have a really good nice and it sounds like you really you know probably on being a good worker and getting there on time and you know it can be hard
6528,high_125,counsellor,from what I'm hearing that to be getting up now that maybe you know your drinking has gotten a little bit more as you got older
6529,high_125,client,well you know the job it's stressful it's stressful and all the kids and I'm going to pay all this money for all these kids in football uniforms cheerleading outfits and cars all that junk you know but I don't want anybody to tell me quit drinking I shouldn't have to that's not you know it's no I shouldn't have to quit completely at all I can still hold my liquor don't get me wrong i understand i mean
6530,high_125,counsellor,it seems like you know you feel like you're good dad and you're trying to provide for your kids and it sounds like you do a great job and you know stressful to have six children and you know to provide for them and be a vice president of a company i mean that's it's a lot to deal with so I mean I can understand that you know you feel like you should be able to do these things and and enjoy them and it sounds like you know you don't really know why you're here and you don't really feel like you need to be here
6531,high_125,client,well just the judge said needed to the wife's little angry and you know but the main thing really I don't want to mess my life up I want to keep the job in those kids get my groceries and that's expensive so I got to keep making money and I'm going to be able to get another job like this one again
6532,high_125,counsellor,I can definitely understand where they're coming from. You want to make sure that you have a job and a livelihood for your family. It sounds like your wife and your kids are very important to you. Is that the reason why you're here?
6533,high_125,client,yeah that is then you know I guess I don't give me hey younger in the doctor said he said then he told me to cut back a little bit I didn't tell me exactly how much I drank but he tested my livery he said you've got this liver enzyme it's a little elevated and it's probably because of that well I'll cut back a little bit but you know I can't stop completely but yeah basically want to keep my job and I don't want to kick off early you know I'd like to live a little longer enough to march football an escort at lunch on this world
6534,high_125,counsellor,so you have you've got you've got some health reports back and the doctor said that you had some elevated liver enzymes and so he's to be making a recommendation it's for you yeah we have quit drinking I said hell no it's not going to happen I want to quit completely he said that but you better cut back he said somebody here in should drink anything more than two glasses of whatever a night so he said cut back a little bit but that won't be a problem what I did hear you say that I thought was really great was that you said that you want to sit around for a while but you're not ready to kick the bucket that you do want to think about your health from that you do want to be here
6535,high_125,client,yeah that's true I'd be one of them a little longer there's a lot of things I want to do and take some trips with old lady and you know see the kids graduate from college that's important I think
6536,high_125,counsellor,that's great i think that you know you you have a lot of really great goals what would your wife if I had your wife in your children here what would they say about your drinking
6537,high_125,client,well they probably
6538,high_125,counsellor,well in life but I'm going to come home a little early to be there on kids come on you know after school and if you go out every night with people from work then you don't get home till eight or nine o'clock at night when you get there well you typically go to bed go sleep early so they want to see me a little bit more and then of course this whole thing about going to jail
6539,high_125,client,well that just one pretty she's got a lot of friends and I think of friends or they're not making fun of the situation but they're just you know it's embarrassing for dive have to tell her friends and she plays cards with her those get hurt done and everything that oh so that's a little difficult for it sounds like you know
6540,high_125,counsellor,you don't really want her to have to experience some of this embarrassin no she don't need to go through this ever p.m.
6541,high_125,client,that's you know that's that's important to me I love her to death nobody should have to deal with that kind of embarrassment
6542,high_125,counsellor,so do you feel like you are able at this time to maybe think about you know not drinking
6543,high_125,client,well as possible rimini on drank on La Feria off and on but nothing to wear was a problem but you know I went for the family I could probably look into that
6544,high_125,counsellor,Scotty you can really see yourself in the next five years where does alcohol fit in your life at this time
6545,high_125,client,well I don't know I think things would be a little bit better if if I did give it up I stayed at home you know my wife and I get along really well she's sweet where I enjoy your company so I would like to spend more time on my third take more trips and things so but if you know I don't have a driver's license or a car or job I can't do any of that so it's probably something I would think about just you know I'll drinking at all
6546,high_125,counsellor,you make some very very good points you know if you don't have a driver's license and you don't have these things than you know it's you're not going to able to do the things that you want to do so it you know it sounds to me like you have some things you know that are very important and some reasons and some people enjoy life who could really benefit from you making a change
6547,high_125,client,yeah I'm told that a liver is expensive if I need another one so I probably should be good to the one I have about god that's probably the chain I'll keep me alive quit drinkin and plus I love southern sweet tea so I can switch to that if I need to but I don't want to too soon yeah I think
6548,high_125,counsellor,that sounds great I mean you know they have some flavor tea center delicious set up their format balls
6549,high_125,client,yeah
6550,high_125,counsellor,well thank you so much for coming in today and I hope that we can we can help out yeah be back next week
6551,high_125,client,all right
6552,high_126,client,good how are you
6553,high_126,counsellor,I'm good. Things just wondering how you've been doing since you at the hospital.
6554,high_126,client,um yeah that's what I've had are we laughs from my depression but I've been doing go with it for the past few months and I've been on some antidepressants and I've been having some going to group therapy so that's been helping me a lot and then I kind of smoking a lot but some pad a lot Ollie asthma flare ups and shortness of breath
6555,high_126,counsellor,so you're making some progress so in a group therapy improving with your depression but you're experiencing some symptoms from your asthma you do a bit more about that
6556,high_126,client,yeah that's what I can't really run as far and like this when I'm going for a little walk from anywhere I kind of have short power beyond shortness of breath and I just get fatigued really easily I just kind of noticed that how about longstone function like they used to
6557,high_126,counsellor,okay so you're getting some shortness of breath and fatigue really easily would it be okay with you if we talked a little bit about your smoking today
6558,high_126,client,um I didn't really come in here for a terminal had that much time so i don't know i was just like to get back on with the appointment
6559,high_126,counsellor,okay I mean I totally understand that that's a difficult subject to talk about and it's completely up to you I just would like to talk about it with you because I do think and have some magnificent on your health today I'm worried about how it's affecting you in your day-to-day life would it be okay if we talk about your health issues and we can kind of slowly talk about it get into that will take a while we keep making a squeaker as long as you want this is your time and we're here for you
6560,high_126,client,okay i guess i'm going to talk about it for a little bit
6561,high_126,counsellor,ok so in your everyday life how else has being affected you other than the shortness of breath and the fatigue that you've been experiencing
6562,high_126,client,um well I'm around my my knees often and my my brother hasn't really want me to washing her unless I like stopped smoking because she gets all the second hand smoke and my my dad died from lung cancer so they kind of suspected that was from smoking so that kind of scares me
6563,high_126,counsellor,okay so that's a negative aspect of smoking for you is that you can't be around your niece and that your father has died from smoking so let's talk about maybe some of the positive things that smoking does for you
6564,high_126,client,um that's what it kind of helps with my depression it kind of relaxes me I feel like if I stop smoking it would probably make me relapse and I would start having the suicidal feelings again and also it's kind of like a social aspect where I kind of hang out with my friends
6565,high_126,counsellor,okay so now let's talk about the opposite side we're going to talk about the pros and cons of stopping smoking so what would be some of the negative things if you stop if you decide to stop smoking
6566,high_126,client,um I guess I want to be able to hang out with my niece as much as I would like to I might follow along the same path as my dad and I mean I'm sure my lungs would probably get worse if I keep smoking my asthma probably get worse
6567,high_126,counsellor,so your eyes one would get worse you can't be with your niece is often and you would be going along the same path as your dad which is ultimately death so let's talk about the positive things of stopping
6568,high_126,client,I know I would save a lot of money. I would probably have less symptoms with my asthma and less shortness of breath. And you see my knees hurt. And I'd probably have an overall better life. And there'd be much less smoke smell on my clothes.
6569,high_126,counsellor,so after we kind of talked about the pros and cons ultimately you have a lot of pros to that you enjoy about smoking it's a social aspect and you enjoyed in a house with your depression but also there's the opposite side where you can't spend as much time with your niece as you want to expect your health it's expensive there seems to be a lot of negative things that you described um well how do you feel about that but there's kind of this discrepancy between the two
6570,high_126,client,um I mean it's a really hard decision but I feel like my house is like the ultimate matter
6571,high_126,counsellor,so I think like that comes first but again I would just be really hard to stop them like you know in this habit well I definitely applaud you for considering it because I know it wasn't something that you claim to come here to talk about and this was on your schedule but it's definitely important to your health and I'm just like to ask you on a scale of  to  with  being not ready to change at all intending but you're ready to change right now right this second where would you lie on that spectrum
6572,high_126,client,well after listen all those pros and cons i guess i would say around a six or so
6573,high_126,counsellor,ok so y is and not a two or three
6574,high_126,client,I guess it made me step back and kind of realize that I might be following the same lifestyles as my dad. I could probably end up dead like him from lung cancer. I mean one of my main things that I enjoy in life is watching my niece. I feel like it would be best for me to stop.
6575,high_126,counsellor,so why a six and not and eight or nine
6576,high_126,client,how do I haven't really thought about that much before so I feel like it will take a little time for me to get there but her dad it's just breaking the habit will probably be the most of calls
6577,high_126,counsellor,so six is a great start and I definitely think that that's something that we can work with together on do you know of any thing that will help you quit smoking?
6578,high_126,client,um I guess I could hang out with another different group of friends or just maybe kind of stay back if they're smoking and try to find something else to do I could also maybe do something to like exercise to kind of get my mind off smoking or do something that'll be beneficial to my health
6579,high_126,counsellor,yeah so exercising did different group of friends that maybe isn't it revolved around smoking with that there's also group therapy that I know you do for your depression which is also awesome to help people stop smoking and we can give you some pamphlets and give you a number that we can set you up with have you ever considered nicotine patches
6580,high_126,client,um no I haven't really thought about it but now that you mention a hug I'll probably look into it
6581,high_126,counsellor,okay so let's get you the number and we can discuss the nicotine patches as an alternative for you that would work we can schedule an appointment in the next two or three weeks and see the progress that you've made and I really am glad that we had this conversation and it seems like you're readily ready to quit so that's awesome
6582,high_126,client,yeah thanks for talking to me
6583,high_126,counsellor,yeah of course
6584,high_127,client,Angelina Jolie
6585,high_127,counsellor,hi Angelina how are you doing today
6586,high_127,client,I'm doing good just I'm having a hard time finding time to exercise
6587,high_127,counsellor,I see um before we talk about that I want you know that whatever we talk about today is going to be kept confidential
6588,high_127,client,yeah
6589,high_127,counsellor,so let's talk more about what brought you in today i have type diabetes and i know i need to exercise to help man to my diabetes but i just cannot make time for it i wish i can find ways to manage my time mm-hmm so you wish to make time to exercise so you can manage your diabetes
6590,high_127,client,yeah
6591,high_127,counsellor,um what are the benefits of not exercising to you
6592,high_127,client,won't look and I just I don't see any benefits of not exercising
6593,high_127,counsellor,and what are the costs of not exercising
6594,high_127,client,it will make my diabetes worse to a point where I have to start taking medication I'm saying
6595,high_127,counsellor,okay so what are the costs maybe of finding time to exercise
6596,high_127,client,mm i would have to make time out of my busy schedule and cut down on things that I like doing my family's like watching soccer I'm see okay and what are the benefits of finding time to exercise if I exercise little hot marriage and will keep me from taking medication and see
6597,high_127,counsellor,so let me see if I understand this correctly so you recognize that exercising is important to control your diabetes and to prevent yourself from taking medications to prevent diabetes um so you also mentioned that to exercise you have to cut down on your family time which is also valuable to you exactly okay son how long will just say from now would you think that you know you take make this change let's say probably within a monk okay so and how on a scale of zero to ten like how important is it for you to make this change and zero being not not not important at all and being the most important I would see having nine out of ten
6598,high_127,client,okay and why is it nine another two or lower number
6599,high_127,counsellor,because like I said it is really important for me to manage time to exercise so that my diabetes can be managed and controlled and on the same scale of zero to ten how confident are you in being able to make the change
6600,high_127,client,I soon I'm probably at eight at a time
6601,high_127,counsellor,okay and so would I be correct in saying that it's very important to you so it's nine out of ten to make time to exercise to stay healthy and mainly to avoid having to take medication to manage your diabetes and your confidence level is at eight out of ten and being able to make this change
6602,high_127,client,yeah
6603,high_127,counsellor,okay so looking back is there a reason that you haven't been able to make time talk to sighs
6604,high_127,client,hmm I just have a very busy schedule with work with kids and also my wife works awesome so it's really difficult to find coming to exercise not only understand
6605,high_127,counsellor,okay so how would you like for things to change
6606,high_127,client,I would like to have more time to exercise at the same time spending time with the plan is important to me
6607,high_127,counsellor,I see so what kind of things did you do to control your diabetes in the past
6608,high_127,client,being physically active whenever possible I see
6609,high_127,counsellor,that's good can you probably give me an example like the activities you did and when was the last time
6610,high_127,client,I used to take my I used to go to the park with my kids um go play soccer with them but then these days they're on I palatal its best everyone that was about a couple of months ago I see and how likely are you able to find time to exercise now I'm sure that I'll be able to make time because if I try my best because my health is important to me
6611,high_127,counsellor,mm-hmm and what makes you feel that now it was a good time to try something different
6612,high_127,client,I think it's important to make change before it's gets gets to a point I have to that we use with medication
6613,high_127,counsellor,mm-hmm so we should like to discuss some of the things you can do to make time to exercise
6614,high_127,client,I could take the stairs inside an elevator and watching the brushy brushy store
6615,high_127,counsellor,well those are some great alternatives instead of going to gym you save a lot of time so did you we want to know did you want to know more things or ways to find time to exercise
6616,high_127,client,yes I feel like that'd be really helpful
6617,high_127,counsellor,okay so since you mentioned that spending time with your family was something that you really value ah you could probably and watching software he said you could you know put a treadmill like a exercise machine near your TV Here I am so you can exercise and watch your movie or software with your family and what you can also probably plan outdoor events or outings with your family something that your kids would enjoy so that they can be off their iPads and technology

6619,high_127,counsellor,those are something you can do maybe go jogging with your family

6651,high_128,counsellor,mm-hmm so your mom interrupts what are the race some of the reasons that she interrupts you probably from you throw something away go to track and one where she was nows on the opposite side of the house and let's I think that's the main one so your mom asks you to throw away things unnecessarily do something that
6652,high_128,client,she I know she can do because my foyer oh brother can do it and she's she couldn't do this
6653,high_128,counsellor,mm-hmm so she doesn't need me mmm just like a little much hmm he has more energy so do you usually spend time on the computer alone in your room or where's the computer in your house
6654,high_128,client,I usually keep it in my room mm-hmm my bed with a cat hmm
6655,high_128,counsellor,so when your mama drugs you you said you have to pause the game when you get frustrated
6656,high_128,client,cuz I'm coming like times in one out she knows she's seen
6657,high_128,counsellor,it all if you can imagine why your mom's doing that what do you think would be her reason for interrupting you so that hard way see but doesn't have to get up mmm because you have to tell me hmm I understand watching well it's frustrating yes well it sound like you care what your mom thinks
6658,high_128,client,when she says my hair is next that hurts my feelings
6659,high_128,counsellor,mmm
6660,high_128,client,because she's supposed to be MERIS follow us dogs news I am I have to say I need you here it's pretty fabulous too
6661,high_128,counsellor,yeah so your mom interrupts you when you're on the computer um and she ever taken your computer with you or tried to stop you from playing with appear
6662,high_128,client,yes she has one time like I didn't need you I shouldn't screw you cuz she ain't on my gummy bears mmm that's a reason j omega versa which is something all of your moment no you get mad mmm my brain turned up you I wasn't in control mmm oh gosh possess me think that's it that's what happened and that happened and then I can use my computer my phone my kindle mmm nothing come in watch TV for three days no electrons for three days yeah night watching TV can you wash them as I didn't want to read all the books at around ten times how many new books so I literally had nothing to dip closer lost all my pencils like a drop
6663,high_128,counsellor,so how did it feel when you couldn't play with your xbox you couldn't play with your computer you couldn't look under candle you couldn't play with your phone you can watch TV it sounds like you were left without most of the things you enjoy the most yeah how does it feel
6664,high_128,client,it felt like as much to explode or die at any moment and I asked if I have my electrons back mmm I've been a second day
6665,high_128,counsellor,mmm couldn't wait ain't no because when you have notebooks like all the books you have our books are very red don't want to read anymore because like you just think of the whole story three head all right just don't let the book in general you look like fences for drawing hi there's nothing to do you will explode mm-hmm do you have any ideas of things you could do or alternative ways to spend your time how did you handle that those three days without your computer
6666,high_128,client,I did not handle the I have a pencil just as wasted my time. I think she could draw since I have the hunger games series now. But an earlier in the year I can read. I can't read though. Stop going to bring back.
6667,high_128,counsellor,so you have three days without your electronics how are you able to do your homework
6668,high_128,client,well um i think it was around left school hmm i don't think i have homework i think is on friday and then well it's difficult to find things to do
6669,high_128,counsellor,well I've met quite a few children who have trouble finding alternative ways to spend their time besides electronics most of us are on our phones or on the computer or emailing each other I'm sure you have texting I'm sure you have a lot of homework you have to get done on the computer typing paper and only you can decide what interests you oh it's essential I used to come here mmm so it's necessary right if you want to be a game developer you feel like this is a learning experience for you to get used to play on computer so that you can actually bring it into your professional life later hmm there's your mom realizes
6670,high_128,client,I've said a billion zillion convoy like in front of everyone doesn't be getting it up and I go up I don't nothing baby younger i dead

6672,high_128,client,l said I was a dead bad days away
6673,high_128,counsellor,oh thanks Emma told Anthony so when you get home from seven hours of school five days a week plus you like to chill with your computer that's your way relaxing it sounds like yes and also I heard you say that you see your mom on her phone all the time so eats the fact that she's playing on facebook and texting while she's telling you not to be on computer seems very hypocritical to you
6674,high_128,client,yes it makes me feel function
6675,high_128,counsellor,mmm you're angry yes so back to when you you had those three days about electronics you shared that you're reading books or you look back and you wish that you had had certain books during yes let's just say you had a chance to go back those three days and take fun things to do with you bit work relays your phone that weren't related to watching something on TV or netflix urn will get youtube or your kindle let's just imagine that we could go in time and take some fun ideas for things to do this in those three days in fact if you wouldn't mind I could share something with you that I've shared with other kids who have trouble thinking of things to do would you like to show you
6676,high_128,client,sure
6677,high_128,counsellor,okay so here's a list and every person has their own preference for what they think is interesting your hobbies and that's what's amazing about how different we all are so no no see the dirt just there's something on that list it popped out you something looks fun something that you can't stay I'm doing this is just a general list of things that people do with your time reading and drawing listen to music
6678,high_128,client,mm-hmm
6679,high_128,counsellor,do you have another way to listen to music besides your computer hunt down CDs

6696,high_128,client,ok
6697,high_129,client,fine thank you
6698,high_129,counsellor,that's good to hear is okay if we just go over a couple of your details
6699,high_129,client,yes that's okay
6700,high_129,counsellor,okay so from the forms that you've filled in earlier today we found out that you're a year old female you have bad knees and have been recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis you have recently sustained a tear to your right shoulder culturally you're from a Fijian Indian background you work part-time and have lived in Australia for years you mentioned earlier that you also assault Carol for you to disable children is that correct
6701,high_129,client,yes that's correct
6702,high_129,counsellor,I appreciate how difficult it must be for you to look after your children by yourself. Now tell me what brings you here today.
6703,high_129,client,my doctor recently suggested I should lose weight and exercise more in order to take pressure off my knees and joints I know I need to lose more weight and my diet can be unhealthy at times and I don't exercise as much as I should I also find that my knees ache from cooking in the kitchen all day for my family and cleaning the house every other day you say your doctor suggested you to come here today but did you want to come here as well I think with my doctor making a point of me coming it bought it to my attention more I know I'm more a little overweight and maybe I should improve on my on my health for me and for my children say the doctor mentioned that excess weight was not helping the pain either
6704,high_129,counsellor,you said that your doctor mentioned that you should come here today that perhaps maybe I can help you some of these issues if you were to change or improve any area of your life where would it be
6705,high_129,client,I guess to try and lose more weight and take the pressure off monies. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable in my clothing and finding that I get tired when I walk small distances. I need to feel frumpy and heavy on my feet. I'd like to be not so puffed out when I walk small distances. Being on my feet so long makes my joints ache as.
6706,high_129,counsellor,well it must be difficult feeling that way and uncomfortable hopefully I can help you with this how important is it for you to change your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10?
6707,high_129,client,I would like to say about I think I'm ready to make a change in my life I'm always doing things for other people um I've been listening to my friends and they say I should start looking after myself more
6708,high_129,counsellor,that's good to hear that your friends are looking after you how confident are you being able to make a change in your life honestly
6709,high_129,client,I'm not sure I've tried to lose weight before I lose a little and then put it back on usually when I'm busy
6710,high_129,counsellor,your stress
6711,high_129,client,I'm not set on the fact that exercise can be effective for me when I exercise my knees hurt and I don't want to lift every ways I understand how difficult it must be for you to lose weight and put it back on again
6712,high_129,counsellor,but you did say that you could lose weight how did it make you feel at the time
6713,high_129,client,I felt Gordon was proud of myself and I went out and even bought a new top
6714,high_129,counsellor,so it sounds like that when you lost weight you felt better that's great and why do you think exercise may not have worked or being so effective for you
6715,high_129,client,I'm not quite sure maybe because I wasn't doing the right things or getting the right advice. You could be right. Can you see that maybe at the time this is why am I noticing improvements? I know it should have probably seeked out more advice from a professional. Again it was just the timing of it and I thought I could do it myself.
6716,high_129,counsellor,I'm sure you could do it by yourself but a little assistance and some knowledge never hurts. What do you think changed that made you potentially put the weight back on?
6717,high_129,client,"I think because I stopped walking on the treadmill I wasn't really caring about the amount of carbs I ate at mealtimes. In my culture we eat a lot of rotor, which is our form of bread. We ate this with most meals. I don't really do anything else but take occasional medication for the pain."
6718,high_129,counsellor,okay it's important for you to recognize that amount of bread that you're eating probably wouldn't have helped and also the fact that you stop walking on the treadmill would lower your capacity to burn that food which an along one would affect your rheumatoid arthritis now that you say it
6719,high_129,client,I probably knew that it's just Bernard recently to find the time and to get back on the treadmill. I work part-time and my children take a lot of my time up so it's really difficult. I hardly get a minute to myself. That's completely understandable.
6720,high_129,counsellor,"From what I can gather, your main issues preventing you from exercise include time and family obligations basically."
6721,high_129,client,yes it's stress for loving to be the sole carer for my family I love my children but they can be hard work it must be but
6722,high_129,counsellor,you can see in order to lose weight and improve on your symptoms diet modifications and some sort of exercise need to be implemented into your daily routine yes that make sense
6723,high_129,client,but do you really think that this would help me
6724,high_129,counsellor,of course it would but you'll need to be committed to your own personal improvements look at how committed you are although it is hard work looking after your family that's true I see your point what do you think it would take to change your mind about participating in physical activity
6725,high_129,client,maybe being able to do exercises that don't take too much time up things I could do at home or it would be great if I could in of my children sometimes
6726,high_129,counsellor,okay so if you were given a program that was realistic with time and easy completed at home do you think you could do this
6727,high_129,client,I think I could give it to go I want to improve my overall fitness I would also like to feel comfortable in myself and reduce the aches and pains in my body great
6728,high_129,counsellor,so it seems as though you have put a lot of thought into your overall goals what if i say to you come back and see me in two weeks do you think in that time you would at least attempt to start the program provided
6729,high_129,client,yes i think i could give it a real girl and try to make it a priority for the next two weeks
6730,high_129,counsellor,on a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you'll be successful
6731,high_129,client,i'm going to say nine out of ten because nothing certain that's an interesting way to look at it
6732,high_129,counsellor,hopefully we can get you to by the end of it hopefully so I can see you're willing to make an effort let's say we meet here in two weeks then hopefully it's hopefully you have some competing exercise of sessions and progress to show me I try my hardest that's all I ask for i'm looking forward to helping you through this journey Jane it was nice to meet you
6733,high_129,client,you too
6734,high_130,client,to Shonda
6735,high_130,counsellor,all right I'm so you refer to me by Linda Smith and today we're here to talk about your alcohol screening survey that you took that's
6736,high_130,client,okay
6737,high_130,counsellor,with you can we discuss some of them with jeers what you scored in a couple of things that's okay
6738,high_130,client,yes
6739,high_130,counsellor,ok so here you scored a which is in the category of risky use so for a women year a woman your age drinks per week and then drinks per day so she's going to go ahead and discuss a few things to ask you a couple questions um so what about drinking do you like
6740,high_130,client,it helps me sleep at night and it calms me when I have like a long day at school
6741,high_130,counsellor,okay and then but what do you like about what do you dislike about drinking
6742,high_130,client,um it's very expensive after a while when you continually buy five bottles of wine or bottles of alcohol in order to go to sleep at night time or to even just feel levels throughout the day
6743,high_130,counsellor,okay so basically what you're saying is that we're drinking alcohol you like that it helps you sleep and it calms you in the way you did talk about alcohol that it's very expensive except what you're saying
6744,high_130,client,yes I go through about thirty to fifty dollars every three days
6745,high_130,counsellor,okay okay um so if it's okay with you on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being not really not ready at all until 10 being very ready how ready are you to cut back on to cut back your drinking or to quit drinking so from a scale of 1 to 10 how ready are you
6746,high_130,client,three
6747,high_130,counsellor,okay um so Wyatt three and not of five or six
6748,high_130,client,um I just like the way it feels i don't know if i get bored I just it's just easy to just grab my fridge and just get a bottle of wine or something it's gotten become very habitual now
6749,high_130,counsellor,okay um so what negative things had happened to you while you've been drinking
6750,high_130,client,um I may send a lot kind of misleading text messages or I may have called my mom puppet on flawless drunk just to like let her know like I was drinking in that you know I kind of put in a little either intoxicated or something so I've sent a flow of calls and text messages to family members that let them know that I drink
6751,high_130,counsellor,okay so what you're saying is that then by eating 'king it's led to you sending risky text messages and just better to see a family into your friends that you wouldn't really send if you were sober correct
6752,high_130,client,yes
6753,high_130,counsellor,okay so um I'm concerned about how you're drinking and how may be affecting your health so is it okay if I follow up with you about this on your next visit
6754,high_131,client,well I'm having some really bad trouble with my time management skills and not being able to stay focused
6755,high_131,counsellor,okay and we talked about a few solutions like working on your time management skills and I did suggest that you go see a doctor about the possibility of having a DD and we did talk about the possibility of you enrolling in the u.s. I counseling center so have you thought any more about those options
6756,high_131,client,it could be a good possibility I could try that out it can always be for the better
6757,high_131,counsellor,okay and so I ask you to think about the pros and cons so what are some of those that you came up with
6758,high_131,client,well some of the cons to it it's going to be you know part of my time my name is a factor mm-hmm like with a doctor since I do not have insurance
6759,high_131,counsellor,okay so taking out time out of your day and the money are obviously some big concerns that maybe we can look into you and we're gone but what would be some positives of doing that
6760,high_131,client,oh it would be the outcome with it for the positive part would be tremendous like I would be able to with
6761,high_131,counsellor,the Counseling Center they provide a service or you're able to
6762,high_131,client,since I do lose focus a lot I'm allowed to take my test in a controlled environment with only by myself and I get extra time you name it enables me to have better focus all around
6763,high_131,counsellor,okay so um now while those are obviously some things that would help you what are some things may be stopping you from doing those already because clearly you know that those are things that are available to you but what stopped you up until now
6764,high_131,client,well with the Counseling Center was taught me was having to have a written agreement and approval from a outside doctor okay but also some other positive aspects of like you know trying to take care of the th ed problems and my time management skills some positive outcomes of those would be being able to function throughout my day besides just you know my test and the Counseling Center
6765,high_131,counsellor,okay so they would help improve really socially socially and a work as well because we didn't talk about some more issues that came up throat okay um now what are some positive attributes that maybe you think you already have that can help you make these changes now what are some things about you that make you think you can definitely do this
6766,high_131,client,oh um I'm a go-getter if I know something and I'm strive enough to do it I'll do it
6767,high_131,counsellor,okay
6768,high_131,client,give me a few more let's see here um I make sure when I start something I make sure I finish it
6769,high_131,counsellor,okay well I don't ever try to leave any things left undone ok so maybe thinking about those maybe we can apply those to you no more ways to motivate you to make those changes and get towards your solutions
6770,high_131,client,okay great
6771,high_132,counsellor,oh it's so good have any way so you know hi study weeks what do you want is the end it's a really big baby this big you're looking so good from your desire it's wonderful
6772,high_132,client,yeah thank you
6773,high_132,counsellor,yeah I know you mentioned last time about the drinking of the alcohol and certain things about that we did cover certain things that can happen when you're drinking now can I ask you a very broad or open-ended question apart from alcohol fetal alcohol syndrome what are some of the other things that you that might happen to you or your baby if we keep drinking during pregnancy
6774,high_132,client,I know there are some problems but I'm not quite sure all of them
6775,high_132,counsellor,I would like you to go with that with me again if it's possible
6776,high_132,client,oh yes
6777,high_132,counsellor,it's good to we just keep reiterating on what's important well apart from fetal alcohol syndrome there are some pretty serious conditions that can also come in because if you're still drinking for a start you can get malnutrition it can interrupt your whole metabolism you actually lose your appetite a bit and some of those really important minerals and vitamins that should grab the bag of you and your baby you're going to miss out on so that's going to be one of your big problems and it can also upset your fertility for next time around and not many people realize that so your whole cycle can be pulled out and you might try have trouble falling pregnant again so there's some pretty serious side effects apart from the fetal alcohol syndrome that you might find affect you in your baby also too they found in some recent studies that the baby can be bored very restless and unsettled so even if it doesn't get fetal alcohol syndrome a lot of clinicians say they can see a baby that's been born to a mother who has been drinking during pregnancy there they actually unsettled hard hard to rest though they that they don't follow the normal patent of a newborn
6778,high_132,client,yeah that's sounds pretty awful
6779,high_132,counsellor,yeah
6780,high_132,client,it's not something that I want to my baby to live
6781,high_132,counsellor,so we really need to work on some strategies down that way so and then probably my next target with you is to talk about how brave you are an affirmation of how brave you are to come in and tell us all about just how this drinking is affecting you and the fact that you want to stop yeah thank you
6782,high_132,client,it's it's hard it's hard um I drink to relax and i think it's it's a habit that emits for a long time and once i get my first doors it's hard to stop so yeah and i've heard some from some people saying and some friends told me that it wouldn't be good for the baby but i don't know it's just hard and
6783,high_132,counsellor,it's so proud of you two coming because a lot of people won't even admit to it let alone come until the Midwife what they're doing when they go home so it's just so very brave of you to come in and tell us all about hey drinking and what we can do together to try and help you stop that
6784,high_132,client,yeah I don't know I was thinking about maybe if I put some signs for myself around the house especially in the frito whatever just to remind myself that drinking is not good for sure and I don't know the other thing maybe just don't have the first dogs
6785,high_132,counsellor,yeah absolutely if you don't have that first if you can stop yourself having that first drink you're more inclined not to keep drinking of course
6786,high_132,client,yeah
6787,high_132,counsellor,it's wonderful you can't have the strategies you so far
6788,high_132,client,that's wonderful yeah I think I might try
6789,high_132,counsellor,that just many want wanting to quit smoking you don't just remind yourself all the time and don't have the first don't have the first and don't start don't start
6790,high_132,client,so yeah this is my strategy for the moment I don't know I would just have to try and see how it goes and I'm glad that I can talk to you what so the next time I can tell you what had been doing this period in if I was succeed or not
6791,high_132,counsellor,I said if it sounds wonderful it's really important to that I reflect on your feelings that's all all part of this and from what you're telling me there's a great sense of guilt and frustration with what you're doing is through its draw
6792,high_132,client,I don't want to do that but it's sometimes it's stronger than me
6793,high_132,counsellor,oh yeah but you're coming up with these wonderful concrete and practical strategies on how you can attack it
6794,high_132,client,yeah now that I know that it's affecting my baby I think that's one of the things that I think it's going to be my you know pop I will get them some strength from that from that knowing that it's gonna harm my baby and so and I put some signs for myself
6795,high_132,counsellor,um it's gonna harm your baby
6796,high_132,client,it's gonna hold a waiver morning also yeah just fantastic
6797,high_132,counsellor,"I just want to summarize now because it's so important because this is such a profound topic for you to talk about and it's really important that I've taken on board everything you've said. Now we've been through, I know we've been through apart from alcohol the syndrome that we've talked about in depth. We've talked about other things that can happen with you in your baby if you continue drinking. We went through all of them one by one and you seem to get a good handle on on those things because you're able to repeat them all to me. You told me that you felt this great sense of guilt and shame about the whole thing about drinking but you have no problem talking to me about it which is wonderful. And then you came up with these wonderful strategies that you can up with yourself how to remind yourself that it's bad fit with the signs. Not if you don't have the first drink your lesson plan to have the third of the fourth. So how to stop yourself having that first drink you think is how you get these changes so so that's wonderful. So I've understood where you're coming from. Do you think by summarizing little?"
6798,high_132,client,yeah yeah yeah
6799,high_132,counsellor,oh you don't yeah it's totally absolutely dead fantastic I just want us to elicit now some change talk and he did talk about those strategies that you were going to do yourself which is exactly what we want we want them to come from you because they're going to work for you is there anything else that you can draw on to make those things happen to stop your drinking no not at the moment not that I can think of but I'll certainly be more aware keep their end up in my mind so if any other strategies that I can come up with i'm going to write it down and bring it to you when we can have a gentle dead
6800,high_132,client,okay
6801,high_132,counsellor,fantastical thanks for coming in today
6802,high_133,counsellor,hi my name is Kaylee I'll be your nurse today I'm just want to tell you that there is confidentiality piece here so everything you say to me is confidential so if there is a chance that you might be harm to yourself or to others or there is a chance of child abuse then I have to let someone else know
6803,high_133,client,okay
6804,high_133,counsellor,so why don't you come into the clinic today
6805,high_133,client,well I have type diabetes I've been diagnosed for some time now and I just I can't seem to get this exercising control I just don't have the time for it
6806,high_133,counsellor,can we explore this issue a little further
6807,high_133,client,yeah sure okay
6808,high_133,counsellor,so why don't we start by you telling me a bit about your day and the struggles you're having to include exercise where that those barriers are coming up and
6809,high_133,client,so my day it's just there's so much I have family have kids on the job and there's so many active self-care activities that come along with being a diabetic again throwing exercise into it it's just it's so overwhelming and it could so dis encourage cuz I just can't find the time for it
6810,high_133,counsellor,okay so you're I hear that you're struggling to find time to fit exercise into your schedule and you're starting to feel pretty frustrated and discouraged with the situation
6811,high_133,client,yeah I just I don't know what to do anymore because
6812,high_133,counsellor,okay well how important is this change to you how much do you want to make this change in your life um let's say from a on the scale from zero to ten with the zero being not important to me at all a ten being very important to me
6813,high_133,client,well I being it I've been so long I've learned a lot about it and I know exercise a major contributor to my diabetic health so I would say it's pretty important maybe a seven
6814,high_133,counsellor,okay okay very important and how confident would you say you are about making this change right now
6815,high_133,client,maybe a two
6816,high_133,counsellor,okay so from what I hear you saying you've had some success in the past without cheating behaviors related to your diabetes it's just life is just simply getting really right now so you have been successful in the past and it sounds like incorporating exercise into your schedule is going to be another really difficult change that you're not sure you want to make but is important to you is that correct
6817,high_133,client,yeah but it's it's sound like it might be just a little too difficult for me I maybe I shouldn't have come here and Florent wasting your time you know what
6818,high_133,counsellor,I'm glad you didn't come in today it shows that you really care about your health and you want to manage your diabetes better. I'm sure it was really difficult to come in today especially since you're not sure you want to make this change.
6819,high_133,client,yeah I I definitely know how important it is that have exercise it's a part of being a diabetic so I just I don't know how I'm gonna do it I don't the time for oh so it does sound like you know the importance of exercise for a diabetic and at the same time life is life is getting in the way right now yeah it's like I said it's very important to me and do want these things for my health I just I don't know how to do it
6820,high_133,counsellor,so from what I hear you saying um you're having difficulty fitting exercise into your schedule and you know the importance of exercise for diabetics what would it be beneficial to you if I provide you with a little more information would that be okay
6821,high_133,client,oh yeah definitely sure please I would like to know about them
6822,high_133,counsellor,okay well but you exercise can help lower your blood glucose and that's important for diabetics and I can all also help lower your blood pressure regular exercise can also increase your energy improve your sleep strengthen your bones muscles there are a lot of benefits which one of those benefits do you think you would appreciate the most energy I'm really glad to help how can you say that like
6823,high_133,client,I would love to have more energy to do the things I do throughout the day and I definitely don't sleep well at night so I didn't even know these were things that came along with exercise and diabetes like having the energy to go through my day and being able to sleep and be awesome actually
6824,high_133,counsellor,it sounds like you're getting kind of excited something that connects my life and like it makes sense right so you'd really you'd really benefit from including exercise oh and it sounds like you're really willing to try to change can you think of some ways you might include exercise in your day
6825,high_133,client,yeah I would love to try harder to make this change and I guess if you if you talk about including ways in the mornings I go to work around and then take my kids to school but I Drive them back so maybe okay
6826,high_133,counsellor,do you think you'd be able to how often would you be able to walk them to school this week

6828,high_133,counsellor,okay that would be great
6829,high_133,client,yeah
6830,high_133,counsellor,so would you you'd be able to walk them to school every day and maybe keep a track of that you've done it for the day and maybe just check it often that way you know you know you've got your exercise in
6831,high_133,client,yeah I couldn't try to do that this week
6832,high_133,counsellor,okay so now that we've discussed these things a bit how one confident are you feeling nail that you have the resources and skills to make this change
6833,high_133,client,well definitely knowing that and have these things impact my health and all these other issues that are facing might be related to this and definitely encourage her and also I didn't know something so small is just taking my kids to school is exercise so I'm very confident now maybe even an eighth okay

6835,high_133,client,well right now fun and it seems like something that I can manage doesn't come involve too much of my time so I think I'll be able to do it
6836,high_133,counsellor,do you think there might be anything that might get in the way in the next week of you doing that
6837,high_133,client,no the only concern I would have is work but I don't start wonderful and the school school kids go to school at I'll be ok ok

6849,high_134,client,yeah it's actually true I've been missing some of my method my DP goes high
6850,high_134,counsellor,yeah ok so I'm can you tell me how a typical day is
6851,high_134,client,we oh well I have four grandchildren year olds year old one month old and my children actually dropped them with me and I stick them to school so around five thirty I wake up I leave them around - I take the a -foot father ticket the year olds to school and our level codigo for half-day kindergarten offerings are only level I pick them back and give them lunch we have it now I prepare supper then around five thirty seven they are picked up and by that time I'm so exhausted so I go to get out a and normally I forget to take my medication understand
6852,high_134,counsellor,so what you're saying is because you are very busy with a children you tend to forget to take the medications of that cervix those way ok so I appreciate your honesty on this issue mrs. key but then let me ask you on a scale of to how important is it for you to take your medication

6855,high_134,client,well it's not as zero because I really want to be there for my grandchildren and besides I don't want to have those complications the doctor talked about like stroke find out more ready for that and it's not a also because I've actually tried a few strategies before like I asked my daughter to call me and she called Madrid hey break time at lunch and normally the money when she drops the children and even when she picks up the kids she reminds me but by the time I'm done with a few activities in the home I'm tired and I forget so I didn't wait that's why it's not eaten either
6856,high_134,counsellor,ok well mrs. key relapses are normal they're your part of the process the important and is for you to move don't be too hard on yourself just move on ok but so what I'm hearing is that it's very important for you to take your mackerras

6864,high_134,counsellor,yeah that's what that sounds good is it okay if I share some thoughts with you as well
6865,high_134,client,yeah sure
6866,high_134,counsellor,"Sure, so you can actually attach taking your medications to various activities of the day. For instance, you can have your morning medications with breakfast, afternoon medications with lunch, evening medications with dinner. Okay, what do you think?"
6867,high_134,client,that sounds visibly
6868,high_134,counsellor,ok ok so I'm going to give you this study sheet I'll seemingly to listen please hang it on your fridge and then there's whenever you take your medications just take it off and then when you are coming back into this comedy so we see the puppies ok that sounds like a visible plan and hanging it on my free to actually reminding good yeah it is the keys are seeing two weeks

6875,high_135,counsellor,you don't believe that you're an alcoholic oh I mean I could understand how upset you can be people think that you're something that you're not great um would you like us to explore a bit more about you know why is what do you think that the priest gave you this did you have any ideas why you would hand you such like a brochure like this
6876,high_135,client,Oh Bonnie I guess it kind of makes sense because I'm here because I got into a partner right and I got hurt so maybe he just thought you know bar fight she's got to be a drunk maybe that's what he thought
6877,high_135,counsellor,okay so would you like to tell me a bit more butch his bar fight that you like
6878,high_135,client,honestly I don't remember much because I know I was drinking I was having some fun with my friends but I think I guess this girl just got to me and sometimes I get a little crazy and I don't know what happened but I know I hurt now so you got into a bar fight
6879,high_135,counsellor,right and and you you would jump Harry oh yeah and you didn't know what was really going on but you know you just think that maybe this girl was not saying something good to you and then you get into this fight
6880,high_135,client,yeah
6881,high_135,counsellor,okay um would you let would you allow me to explore a little bit more about the drinking and alcohol
6882,high_135,client,it's really okay
6883,high_135,counsellor,so how does alcohol affect you like what what does he do for you is doing it like
6884,high_135,client,I like it it's fun I go out with my friends and we go drinking and like after work it's like the best way to just chill you know is to have a beer just relax so for me it's fun and it's my way of just relaxing and hanging out with my friends
6885,high_135,counsellor,yeah I understand so you you like having fun your friends drinking is a normal thing for you guys to do and you don't see a problem with what you're doing with your friends like you're just drinking one
6886,high_135,client,I'm not driving um you know yeah it's just fun
6887,high_135,counsellor,so it seems to me that drinking is not really a problem that you in your life right now um but would you say though that there are some negative effects that that alcohol is doing in your life right now it would you like to tell me if it's affecting you in that way?
6888,high_135,client,well I mean I I'm kind of cut up so that's not a good thing related to my drinking I guess Joey he's my boyfriend he really doesn't like it when I'm drinking and we get into a lot of fights and he says I'm just not normal when I drink so I guess that would be the negative stuff
6889,high_135,counsellor,so I like it he said your friends drink you drinking is fun something fun but on the flip side and the bad side it's affecting your relationship with your boyfriend he does not like it the way you act are you drinking so it is affecting the relationship negative rate okay um so back in the Alcoholics Anonymous if you of mine I'm so we what do you know about a it's a meeting for people who drink
6890,high_135,client,mm-hmm
6891,high_135,counsellor,talk about it okay so you know under your the right track about you know people meeting it's a group of people um that talk about alcohol okay so with your boyfriend it sounds to me that is what you say is how Koren is he in your life marry that guy he's important we're gonna be like together okay so that's great you know at least you're thinking about a feature with Joe and you think that he's really important in your life right now um and then you also said that he does not agree with the drinking I would like to ask you this question now would you be willing to take it a step further and maybe check that
6892,high_135,client,I check out one of these programs
6893,high_135,counsellor,for the sake of your relationship is that something that you're willing to look at willing to in the future
6894,high_135,client,yeah or never thought of it before but I'm willing
6895,high_135,counsellor,um so okay I would like to give you a scale of 1 to 10 in a scale one to 10 how likely would you go and check out one of these programs
6896,high_135,client,sex sex Elton
6897,high_135,counsellor,so you would say to safe that's very surprising because it's not a one like it's very good why would you say it's not a one and it's a six that you're likely to go
6898,high_135,client,because of Joey like he doesn't like me drinking hmm I mean I'm only it's not affecting my health now but I know when I get older and really affect my health and Joey won't stop babies and he keeps telling me I can't drink and if I want to get pregnant
6899,high_135,counsellor,so I mean those are the things that's really I recommend it for that you're thinking about a future Joey you're thinking that maybe you'll have children with him someday and if you do try you think that it will make your relationship better which one factor should be a good way how well he said it's a six right so what do you think would happen would need to happen to make it a nine for you that you really like most likely to just go in and try one of these programs
6900,high_135,client,well I guess like if the place was closed then if I like the people there and if I got something out of it then it would make me go
6901,high_135,counsellor,okay that sounds good and it sounds reasonable that if it's closer to you it's easier for you to stop by
6902,high_135,client,yeah
6903,high_135,counsellor,um if you'd like if you're interested I would be able to help you find a place a closer area where the program is hell it's easier for you to to get there it's closer to your house would you be willing to find out a bit more about that
6904,high_135,client,sure yeah
6905,high_135,counsellor,okay so thank you for talking to me about this whatever village for Joey and how alcohol is maybe affecting your relationship and you know and your may be willing to go and try one of these programs would you like to meet up with me in the next two weeks and see how how this program is to you like if you've tried it if you have any more questions or concerns for me look at where you are at in this situation is that something to do it

6910,high_136,client,of course I came to the doctor because I was trying to clean these strokes and ladder fell down and I I'm kind of back hurt pretty bad was that a little bit how long ago was that it's been a fun month a month ago
6911,high_136,counsellor,okay okay how are you go if I start on how you're you look really healthy good very healthy Bush won last year why yes sure are you do you have a family are you married
6912,high_136,client,I'm married years years

6914,high_136,client,yes and I told buddy my wife is it's six donors that's that's pretty big as a lot of that's big that's bigger than most people today grandchildren six great-grandchildren one month away
6915,high_136,counsellor,yeah wow that's that's that's quite a quitter we're going to turn gotta try to hold those nation there that's good that's really are you retired
6916,high_136,client,yes sir sort of our agreement
6917,high_136,counsellor,where you've been working most of your life
6918,high_136,client,I've worked in a lot of things if Undertaker in the MTO ambulance assistant manager bookstore work for radio shack or plan jack of all trades almost maybe not maybe master
6919,high_136,counsellor,yeah I bet you have a lot of life experience it's it's been interesting that's great it's great so tell me about your troubles with her
6920,high_136,client,back first you know in the daytime when I could move around it's not as bad I still have to take medication but at night is very good at night I can't sleep I wake up a lot it's very hard to be comfortable at night
6921,high_136,counsellor,so moving around seems to help you have less pain it's but when you're sleeping at night or you're staying in one place you have more pain
6922,high_136,client,I think so
6923,high_136,counsellor,okay how does the prescription medication fit into your lifestyle right now those last one I see here that you have your taking oxycontin or the taking oxycodone pushes a generic brand new do you realize that's an opiate it's the same this is a painkiller it's similar to what how that a coat of opium is the same thing got an opiate they would make similar to heroin and a lot of people take opiates different kinds of paint further pain medication problems and they hurt their back or they have injuries do you realize that it's highly addictive
6924,high_136,client,it can be we'll just take it I get to hurt they tell me that you can only take it every four hours I can't wait that long
6925,high_136,counsellor,yeah it's uh it sounds to me I mean how long how often you take are you taking it is you you're taking it as prescribed is that correct what should ignore your daytime and i can't wait them and say you take you find yourself more you've been finding yourself taking work how much is that increase over the last last one half
6926,high_136,client,as long as shit there Toby vision
6927,high_136,counsellor,okay and have you talked to your doctor about possibly increasing the dosage what you doesn't want to do that so I hadn't go to their doctor to get you more
6928,high_136,client,ok
6929,high_136,counsellor,so now you're seeing two doctors to work with the pain medication right for your back
6930,high_136,client,yes
6931,high_136,counsellor,and that's so that you can get more is that because the first doctor won't give you communi give you enough ok and he gave you as prescribed in the beginning a specific amount and if he go he did he did well he gave you a specific amount and he's not willing to go any further good woman they could okay and so but you felt that you needed to get more difficult Lee okay so you went to a second doctor together to get more okay I'm just trying to clarify to make sure that I understanding correctly has heaven do you know what tolerances loaded with black people no tolerance is and when it comes to medications and drugs and alcohol so when a person would take a certain amount of medication or they might take a certain drug or they might drink a certain amount and they would continue to increase the amount and as time went on their body could only take so what their body kit would want more it's like creating one more and more and over the last month how many times have you increased your medication we could really keep track Tyler to the right foot listen let's narrow it down
6932,high_136,client,maybe over last week or I can't I your only lasts about two hours to latch run into some flashes
6933,high_136,counsellor,okay so it it's only lasting two hours and it's posted last hour motion much hold for four hours of time but it's only lasting two hours and then you're taking more increasingly and so your date or how many times have you increase that dosage on your own couple times
6934,high_136,client,I suppose
6935,high_136,counsellor,okay
6936,high_136,client,so how how much should be taking her per day now as opposed to its prescribed every four hours
6937,high_136,counsellor,so you should you should take it every four hours and you've taken it took it over to every two hours and how many pills to build two pills so technically you're supposed to take it every four hours so in a -hour period you're taking it about five times or six times maybe and what you were you were prescribed to Kazakhstan
6938,high_136,client,right
6939,high_136,counsellor,okay and sat down and now you're taking it a total of twelve times ouch
6940,high_136,client,okay
6941,high_136,counsellor,and that's over a month period
6942,high_136,client,okay
6943,high_136,counsellor,all right it sounds can I make a suggestion or can I give you a little bit of feedback it sounds to me like it is that you're increasing that you've increased your tolerance because of the amount of pain that you're having you've increased your increasing a tolerance level for the medication handle so much medication and you're building up a tolerance now for it that's the beginning stages of addiction and I wouldn't say that you're in too bad a shape at this point or anything but what concerns me is that you are increasing your amounts of medication regularly you're seeing a second doctor to get more deep do you see a problem or discrepancy with my backers
6944,high_136,client,okay
6945,high_136,counsellor,so you're a problem
6946,high_136,client,okay
6947,high_136,counsellor,all right you you have taken medication that you took over the prescription hands against your doctors for or orders on them and then you saw a second doctor to get the second amount medication you're building up a tolerance and a resistance to the medication if you continue to take the medication at this rate where do you think you'll be in the next days okay right now you're taking medication at a rate of taking you started off with one let's take two pills okay originally at your six times a day every four hours I believe I'm doing my math right
6948,high_136,client,okay
6949,high_136,counsellor,and you increase you doubled that in at one stunna against the wishes of your first doctor and you spoke to a second doctor is your first doctor note about the second doctor what about the second doctor so they don't know each other they don't know ok so that's a problem in a bits out there that
6950,high_136,client,I don't I know
6951,high_136,counsellor,it's because you're you're in pain but you can crease your mouth over this last month if you continue on this trajectory continue moving forward doing what you're doing right now I month down the road where do you think medication intake is going to be super trippy you'd probably be double introduced no double what is now you see a problem with that sounds like at this point right now you're you're you're you're lucky because you're very very early in the stage statements
6952,high_136,client,okay
6953,high_136,counsellor,but if you continue forward with it it can become an increasingly highly addictive problem and you would you would need a formal treatment inpatient treatment at this point you that's not necessary impatient Rick we what we would need to do is determine boy or like for us both determine what we could do to manage the pain slow down the amount of medication you're taking before
6954,high_136,client,okay
6955,high_136,counsellor,would you well first of all first thing I would like that is on it at this point right there on the scale to being least important being most highly important where where do you see yourself right now as high as important as this how important is it for you to change your current path help with that quick pretty close for joining a time
6956,high_136,client,okay eight or nine
6957,high_136,counsellor,okay would you would you be interested in possible pain they're seeing that they're just because I I can refer you to a therapist that helps with pain management it's not medication base it wouldn't take you off your current medications that would help you manage your pain better through several techniques and therapies it's relatively low cost and expensive and the money that you'd be spending to increase your medication you actually be saving by seeing the pain being retired doctor yeah and that way you would have to see two doctors regularly but you can't do some a management as well let me ask you another question on a scale another scale scale of to on confidence level how confident do you feel that that you could get some help and change this district
6958,high_136,client,that wouldn't be as high because my back hurt
6959,high_136,counsellor,yeah it hurts all the time so that makes you look pretty that would be a more under scale so a little bit lower on the scale okay so because your back you think your your back let's talk about that a little bit just for a moment here when you're hurting and your back is hurting tremendously what's besides trying to relieve the pain let's really what's what's going on through your mind well you can never get relief with these lay down or sit down or stand up it hurts all the time hurts a little less when I'm moving around when I'm still more contrary it bothers more right now just having to sit here that's all I nobody tell you about it so do you would you do you want to we talked about you want to consider shortly then what we want to do is make it would you like to make a goal and follow up about it about a week or so perhaps make a smart home real like what we could do is one have a specific color plan perhaps maybe see I'll refer you to my my reps is verb for pain management specialist do you think you could what's a good time you could probably make an appointment to see him probably tuesday or thursday tuesday or thursday
6960,high_136,client,okay
6961,high_136,counsellor,what's a good time you can come in and see me again that's weak do you think you can add it in gate you cook
6962,high_136,client,okay
6963,high_136,counsellor,do you think maybe tuesday you can see the pain specialist and management specialists and then maybe CD on thursday just follow just to show check in see how you're progressing
6964,high_136,client,okay
6965,high_136,counsellor,Zack seem attainable an attainable goal for you so far ok and then so we kind of boiled that down so it's actually going to be time times of actually the soul what time on Thursday time Jepsen afternoon two o'clock in two o'clock
6966,high_136,client,okay
6967,high_136,counsellor,I think that you I mean it still looks like talking to you you I know that you something kind of summing it up everything you didn't at first you didn't see the direction that your pain medication might be taking you in but now you clearly see that it could take you in this direction that could really be harmful to do good okay and that's the pain management might be a better alternative coming coming together with the medication and in a piglet pain medicine and actually is some sort of treatment therapy kind of work on some ideas to try to help you sunny weather swine okay and hope we'll see it and see basically if that works and we can go from there next week we need to get their gear
6968,high_136,client,sure
6969,high_136,counsellor,okay Don it's been really good to talking with you today thank you
6970,high_136,client,all right you have a good day I think that was a little bit better
6971,high_137,client,okay
6972,high_137,counsellor,um first to start the session off with I just want to touch on our confidentiality policy so that entails you I want you to be able to disclose everything that you can to me but I also AM supposed to inform you that if you disclose anything that could either harm you or is going to harm somebody else that I need to inform the proper authorities
6973,high_137,client,okay
6974,high_137,counsellor,um and then I also just want to let you know if you see me taking notes or anything don't be worried it'll just um just sort of help me out stuff like that so um why do you think you're here today
6975,high_137,client,um well basically I for the past couple years I've been stealing a lot of stuff like I'll go to like Walmart and Target and victoria secret and all these stores and I'll to steal a bunch is like clothing and like headphones and easy stuff to steal not necessarily the clothing because sometimes I have to rip the security tag off but i'll either stick in my bag or I'll like put it under my clothes and I'll walk out or whatever and basically my mom asked me the other day like why I have so much nice clothing and I don't really have a job or anything and basically she kind of figured it out and made me come here
6976,high_137,counsellor,okay um so first of all first of all I want to commend you for coming in here today and taking that first step um so I want to start off with asking do you think that this is a problem for you
6977,high_137,client,um I do kind of think it's a problem because I started off stealing like really little stuff like gum and candy and like magazines and stuff and now I'm kind of on to like the bigger stuff like the stuff that costs a lot more money so I think it is kind of a problem because it's gotten progressively worse okay so it definitely
6978,high_137,counsellor,sounds like you understand that the problem is progressing um well on a one to ten scale being the most serious how serious of a problem do you think this is and you're like right now
6979,high_137,client,I feel like it's like a because my parents. I think the reason I do it is because my parents don't really have a lot of money and they never really had a lot of money. I still want to be cool and have like the latest fashion and hang out with my friends and and then not judge me for having not cool clothing and stuff and like the cool stuff. I feel like it is a problem I need to address because it's getting. I need to stop doing it since I'm almost out of high school.
6980,high_137,counsellor,okay so um I can tell that you'd feel like because your parents don't have a lot that you kind of feel the need to steal in order to kind of keep up socially
6981,high_137,client,um yeah okay
6982,high_137,counsellor,so what would have to happen for you to know that this is a problem or move higher up on the scale of how serious
6983,high_137,client,i think the i think i would need to have to like get into serious legal trouble probably like arrested or or like a charge or something or like just something really scaring me because right now I feel like I'm like nothing that's going to happen to me because I do it all the time and I've been doing it for a long time
6984,high_137,counsellor,okay well it's it's definitely good that you grasp the possible consequences of jail time and things like that what do you think that the pros and cons of making this change are
6985,high_137,client,um I think the pros are that I would probably stay out of trouble and the other pros would be like my family like my mom would be off my back my dad wouldn't be like embarrass I do it and the cons would probably mean that like my friends might not think on my school because I don't work will close and I think it might be kind of hard for me to stop because I've been doing it for so long
6986,high_137,counsellor,okay um so would it be safe to say that friends and family are definitely something that you value
6987,high_137,client,yeah
6988,high_137,counsellor,I lee in your life they're pretty hot
6989,high_137,client,yeah
6990,high_137,counsellor,um so I think I'm seeing a little bit of a discrepancy between your behaviors and then I guess your relationship with like your family and friends do you feel like these behaviors affect your relationship with
6991,high_137,client,definitely because my mom and dad have been like really on me about it and then like my friends don't know about it but i just feel like if i do like end up getting in trouble when i go to jail that like it's going to be even worse for me like socially because they weren't like wow she didn't steal and she went to jail for a long time for stealing when I could have just told him that I has happen money issues
6992,high_137,counsellor,yeah um well what do you think that you could do to overcome these barriers and make it easier for you to change these behaviors
6993,high_137,client,um I think that I could tell all my friends that like I am having him on each other when I've always had money trouble and if they don't understand if they don't understand and they're not my friends and I could if I ever felt like I needed to steal I could talk to like my mom or my dad or my sister my brother before I feel the urge to steal and then I guess lastly I could try to find a job
6994,high_137,counsellor,yeah definitely those are a lot of good ideas um do you believe that changing these behaviors will be in your best interests
6995,high_137,client,uh definitely because I really need to stop doing it because I'm I'm getting too old for it and I don't want to have to go to jail
6996,high_137,counsellor,um okay well it looks like we're almost out of time here so um just in between like now in our next session if you feel like you have any compulsions to to steal or anything like that um I want you to kind of focus on these goals and things that we thought about that you could do or like talk to your family members or even talk to your friends about Hannah being a support system and helping you to maybe avoid these feelings that you need to steal and then in our next session we'll talk more about smaller steps to get you going on your way but I think we made a lot of progress like this session and so yeah well that's a good place to stop and we'll pick up where we left off
6997,high_137,client,all right thank you
6998,high_138,counsellor,so where you said you'd like to start Sal is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other
6999,high_138,client,yeah my as was just been out of control lately and my doctor says it might be connected to Oscar
7000,high_138,counsellor,hmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse
7001,high_138,client,"I've got allergy testing it's just the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing that's cut down. And then they said the drinking might contribute to it too. So I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know. The drinking, the smoking, and the dust that I got the scratch test for, right? And that's what I know. And that I take the medicine for it."
7002,high_138,counsellor,okay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern
7003,high_138,client,no I've had it for years and now it's a concern I don't understand
7004,high_138,counsellor,hmm yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free
7005,high_138,client,does that work what the boy said
7006,high_138,counsellor,yeah okay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards
7007,high_138,client,that mm-hmm I'm a little I'm a couple down I used to drink for a night now I'm down to three at least
7008,high_138,counsellor,okay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what what's next
7009,high_138,client,yeah yeah
7010,high_138,counsellor,okay so I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms
7011,high_138,client,well we keep him clean like he's clean so all the dander doesn't really make sense but I have been noticing sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside I wheeze a little bit but I think it has to do with um the hair the in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking so I don't know if it's that that's where I'm confused I don't know how this could be happening
7012,high_138,counsellor,hmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution
7013,high_138,client,but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit I guess
7014,high_138,counsellor,"I also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long."
7015,high_138,client,mm-hmm mmm I just want some medicine and I want to keep Oscar and I want to feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life in it honestly feels like my my nose is just above the water
7016,high_138,counsellor,mmm yeah and and in the end you know whatever you whatever you do about Oscar about your asthma about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda setting worksheet I mean you are in the driver's seat salad it really is your choice
7017,high_138,client,hmm ya know that feels good that I you know ELISA it is my choice I just feel like just about I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up and I'm kind of sad about things and I don't know I don't know what to do
7018,high_138,counsellor,there's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife with the new baby and and now thinking about looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby
7019,high_138,client,you know I want I want Giancarlo to grow up with Oscar so he has his friend when he's young too and I just it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you got to think about and I'm not feeling good about it
7020,high_138,counsellor,mm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how would you know when you win or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not
7021,high_138,client,yeah how would I know I don't know I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine if she gave me the strongest medicine and I wasn't working
7022,high_138,counsellor,mm-hmm
7023,high_138,client,that would be the way right now cuz I can't see I don't know how I'm gonna give this dog up
7024,high_138,counsellor,yeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry
7025,high_138,client,no no it's something I got to just sit there and kind of put the pros and the cons on the table about but something's going on
7026,high_139,client,yeah it's fine
7027,high_139,counsellor,okay one of the things that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right now
7028,high_139,client,yeah
7029,high_139,counsellor,okay and I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas and and I wondered what what your thoughts are about using condoms
7030,high_139,client,well I've heard stuff about them that I don't really need them and they're not going to do much for me and just kind of hassle to go out and get them so okay I don't really use them for that reason
7031,high_139,counsellor,you've heard a lot of negative things about condom usage okay so Chris it's okay if I share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage
7032,high_139,client,yeah that's okay
7033,high_139,counsellor,what some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia along with HIV they're really effective in preventing these things and there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free and local pharmacies drug stores have condoms and there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free and there's some some ways too that people have found carrying them around pretty convenient you know in their car or in their pocket because they're pretty small what does it sound like as I'm talking what are some thoughts that are going going through your mind
7034,high_139,client,definitely changing my mind about condoms a little bit think there's no hurt and just carrying them with me and if they do protect against all that stuff that you said I mean that sounds a lot better than what I have heard I definitely want to avoid all those consequences
7035,high_139,counsellor,okay we're not interested in and coming a father right now I'm guessing
7036,high_139,client,not yeah
7037,high_139,counsellor,okay great well can I ask you so after this conversation today on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important where do you think you fall with how important you know taking a chance in using condoms with you now.
7038,high_139,client,after everything that you've told me it sounds pretty important to me we're like an eight or nine
7039,high_139,counsellor,okay okay well that's great it sounds like you really have you know a plan in mind what do you think you'll do next like what do you think would be a next step with you as far as contraception and condoms
7040,high_139,client,probably go out and look for some condoms
7041,high_139,counsellor,okay we have an open mind to them okay well we've got some here at the clinic would you like me to give you some on your way out and you can just take them with you
7042,high_139,client,Yeah
7043,high_139,counsellor,Great well thank you so much for talking to me it was nice to meet you
7044,high_140,counsellor,so let me tell you what I normally do in this this interview and we will talk for up to it maybe 20 minutes or so normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week and then we just talk together about that so but I always like to just start with wherever you would like to start
7045,high_140,client,yeah yep I mean like when I was doing those questionnaires it was weird because I mean I guess I don't really think about like you have looked drinking and being like this huge deal and I don't ever really think about like like how much I drink um and like sit like filling out like how much I'm drinking every day was like whoa you know like I just didn't ever really think about it like that I was like if I try to actually count the drinks it's kind of a lot I mean it's kind of a lot
7046,high_140,counsellor,you were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns
7047,high_140,client,yeah cause like I also kind of thought that like I drank like about as much as my friends did and then like I went back and I was like talking to my roommate about it and I was like telling her that you know I was drinking like like ten drinks on the weekends like including Thursday so like Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday mm-hm and then she was like Sarah that's quick like that is crazy why you know like where are you drinking this and I was I was like well you know like different places I I guess like I don't know my friends didn't like know anyway
7048,high_140,counsellor,yeah yep yeah this information has opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you as you realized when you did the questionnaire
7049,high_140,client,yeah and yeah I guess it was just like I thought that everybody was like doing it you know but that's not really what's going on
7050,high_140,counsellor,yeah the fact that you're drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before thus far I am very
7051,high_140,client,yeah yes so that was a thing that like was really the most weird about doing those forms
7052,high_141,counsellor,The case just got transferred to me so I'm not very familiar with your case
7053,high_141,client,"Right, I my daughter's 17 years old okay. she she's actually very high-functioning thankfully and you know I went to three of these programs and none of them"
7054,high_141,counsellor,so you're looking you're looking for a day program right and something that really was good for your daughter
7055,high_141,client,"Right, right, and I mean I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, you know, that she'd really enjoy going to. But I mean they were either like babysitting programs or they were just the participants were all at like different developmental levels so that she couldn't really she could make friends."
7056,high_141,counsellor,mmm yeah they were they were not not good for her you while you were there it was difficult your daughter didn't really kind of fit in or connect with anybody while you were visiting
7057,high_141,client,no not she did not she she just there just was wasn't that that sense of like that common commonality you know just she there was no um no basis or like friendships there was there were there were some young young people there who are like screaming yelling and who are talking to themselves and she didn't know how to engage
7058,high_141,counsellor,so so just there wasn't when when you visited they didn't sort of the program didn't help you to connect sir help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were Just sort of viewing it
7059,high_141,client,"right, well I mean I observed for a whole day in each of these programs"
7060,high_141,counsellor,okay
7061,high_141,client,which was there's a lot of time yeah yeah I mean like you know I work full time and I don't it was very difficult to schedule time to go to these places and once I did it was just so disappointing
7062,high_142,counsellor,okay nice to meet you Rachel cause your day going
7063,high_142,client,it's good it's a little exhausted from life that's about it
7064,high_142,counsellor,"Okay before we go any further, isolation. Oh yuck about their genius with with minutes together today. I have a couple topics I'd like to discuss. But before going where it is, is there anything you'd like to?"

7067,high_142,client,oh wow so my family doctor keeps telling me that I need to exercise because I type diabetes but I just don't understand why like I'm so busy with life and see how we feel sexy vibes
7068,high_142,counsellor,I completely understand your you have a busy lifestyle how are you going to fit exercise into that lifestyle
7069,high_142,client,yeah
7070,high_142,counsellor,so can you tell me about your day from when you wake up to
7071,high_142,client,"sure well I wake up in the morning and I work a -hour shift at the factory then it comes home I have to cook for my husband clean the house make sure clean before I go to bed and then sometimes my kids come on the weekend or during the week because they're so far away they're not the university and just spend time with them I guess Okay, so seems like you have a busy lifestyle and your doctor wants to include exercise into the lifestyle yeah"
7072,high_142,counsellor,why do you think your doctor would like to add to your heavy or your busy workload
7073,high_142,client,he keeps telling me you need to be healthier it will help manage my diabetes and like I just don't understand why there's so many people my age most of my friends don't even exercise of their healthy like why do I have to exercise to be healthy
7074,high_142,counsellor,okay I hear you so on one hand you've gone all your life all day you've gone years and you're still you leave you're healthy and you don't think you need to add exercise or anything else like that but on the other hand to your doctor is telling you that exercise would help your diabetes and exercise will help you so what do you feel are some of the advantages of God working out are not adding exercise to hear
7075,high_142,client,well not on the exercise I'm already like so exhausted by the end of the day so if I'm exercise to it i will i'll be even more exhausted so that advantage is that of a little more relaxed compared to when I will exercise and also like I get to spend so much time with my family if I don't exercise if I prepare an hour two hours of exercise and I will never get to see the kids see my husband spend time with them do activities with them and yeah
7076,high_142,counsellor,it's good to see that you really enjoy spending time with your family and spending time with your kids do you can you tell me about some of the important things in your life
7077,high_142,client,well my feelings a huge part of my life I love spending time with them my husband and I are always together after work we don't we try to not separate and do our own thing you try to play together and then my kids are my daughter goes to University of Waterloo and mentor mostly University of Western so they're so far away from us I came to spend time with them like every single day i want to so when i get to see them i try to make the most out of it
7078,high_142,counsellor,that's really good to hear so your would be seriously you're proud of it proud of you too can and you enjoy spending a lot of time here of course yeah and you'd you cherish the time you get to spend with your weakest and me because you made it so get them to fit into your already hectic lifestyle yeah advantage of these people exercise

7080,high_142,counsellor,I think you'll be a good stress reliever when I run of the track down and also maybe I can include the heart center. You can spend some time at the gym together and all the weekend.
7081,high_142,client,I can have a kid and we can have a little family care to the gym. But if you don't they'll be exhausted. And I've done so luxurious way that I'll be tired by the time I'm done at the gym.
7082,high_142,counsellor,so it's my understanding that you feel like exercising with other than we needed extra help by reducing or eliminating your insulin insulin dosage it could help you lose weight after the stress reliever you can come out really take care I've been in your children we have attended at it but you're still worried that he was really diving not how to continue on today after telling some strategy diseases including your
7083,high_142,client,maybe I could go like an hour or two before I was terrified to love is when I come back home all I just showered like that a lot that we don't have to worry about me doing anything after I'll just worry about getting epson experience part of the video
7084,high_142,counsellor,so you would change the time you go to drinks or the lines which one you want to go
7085,high_142,client,yeah
7086,high_142,counsellor,and from what you're saying earlier you want to include your family and your husband or their bed we were straight the new year it support system comes with him any company any reason trying to see like
7087,high_142,client,well i'm still looking they're always here to support you through anything about happening or motivates me once more like maybe if they come along with really likes you can do it motivation and support me and we can put together a movie we can all have a healthy life with my doctors own okay
7088,high_142,counsellor,so it looks to me like something and you're motivated scream and they will help you along your certain tone actual target any feel like if they're there with you then to improve monopoly entire thing and I'll just after the succession beauty like you have a plan
7089,high_142,client,yeah I think I'm new start going to the gym this year they really went to me the next step is maybe after I'm done here i can get the gym class for likely be first to apply there and then in frigid spot for a whole year and start working again
7090,high_142,counsellor,have you tried?
7091,high_142,client,me know because i always thought i would be exhausted but now that I figure out the timing a one to go and tough oh I can definitely do it Thank I'm
7092,high_142,counsellor,"Scale of one to ten, one being you're not really sure at all. Ending returning to do with how. How come are you indifferent as you don't go to your mate?"
7093,high_142,client,I think I can do it well right now. I know I want to do it. I can do it but to reach his time I feel as I have to be doing it for a whole week of regular yes some medical school some wonder open to any sort of follower or check out after to make sure there's sure. Maybe I can come see you in a month and I feel like to know what I've been doing and maybe I since my fateful blocks from the movie activities. Yeah and let me know if my glucose levels are going down or what's happening official website. So like always going to be to perform position with Kentucky's if we make success all in there over I maybe go for minutes minutes per day and we'll try going around seven o'clock.
7094,high_142,counsellor,that way I concede little not your life better
7095,high_143,counsellor,yes last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety and according to my notes you were going to look into some yoga classes you were going to attempt to drink less coffee you were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home and you were going to spend more time in nature so I'm wondering how all that went
7096,high_143,client,well I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes so I didn't I didn't really do that I did cut back on my coffee a little bit but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning so you know I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups and I did take the dog for a walk but I haven't really gotten out other than that
7097,high_143,counsellor,okay so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals you did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes you did cut down from two cups of coffee to one and you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk but it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue getting out more with people
7098,high_143,client,yeah I don't I don't really like to go out with people there's usually a lot a lot of chatter a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in there
7099,high_143,counsellor,so it's uncomfortable for you to be out around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking and how does that make feel
7100,high_143,client,um it just makes me feel a little bit nervous and then when I get out there don't really I don't really engage in conversation
7101,high_143,counsellor,okay so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious so I'm wondering what we could do about that
7102,high_143,client,um I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead
7103,high_143,counsellor,that would absolutely be one option you could invite people over to your house and then you could get to choose who you're around
7104,high_143,client,yeah it's a good idea
7105,high_143,counsellor,and in terms of the the yoga let's get back to the yoga format tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes
7106,high_143,client,well I just looked at my gym I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying to go to a gym and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else so that's why I didn't really look anywhere else
7107,high_143,counsellor,mm-hmm and so if I were to ask you right now how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to ten
7108,high_143,client,maybe about a five or six
7109,high_143,counsellor,okay and so what made you say five or six rather than two or three
7110,high_143,client,um well I I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it so I'm interested in doing it it's just really hard
7111,high_143,counsellor,so when you see the pictures on your newsfeed it makes you excited about doing it but when you actually go to do it it makes it yeah more challenging
7112,high_143,client,well it's it I haven't done it before so it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible as the other people
7113,high_143,counsellor,mm-hmm and so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people I'm wondering if that's what yoga is about civility
7114,high_143,client,well I think I think that people go to become flexible but I think that maybe some people are already just flexible
7115,high_143,counsellor,mm-hmm so you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest yeah and you'd be a beginner
7116,high_143,client,well I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class
7117,high_143,counsellor,okay so what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class
7118,high_143,client,well I I feel embarrassed I think and then if the teacher tried to get me to do it and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose and I think it would be embarrassing
7119,high_143,counsellor,okay so you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain poses and how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class
7120,high_143,client,well I think I feel really good
7121,high_143,counsellor,and so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class
7122,high_143,client,why I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it
7123,high_143,counsellor,what what would cause you to not be able to do it with the closest or not
7124,high_143,client,I'm not sure
7125,high_143,counsellor,okay I remember when you first came in last week you told me that when you were younger you used to be very very flexible I'm wondering what would make that difference between then and now
7126,high_143,client,well when I was a kid I used to just practice a stretch a lot and now that I don't I don't have that same flexibility
7127,high_143,counsellor,mm-hmm
7128,high_143,client,so as I've gotten older I've lost a lot of flexibility
7129,high_143,counsellor,and how would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed
7130,high_143,client,I mean it would be okay but I don't I don't like that feeling what would be the payoff
7131,high_143,counsellor,do you think if you put up with a little bit of embarrassment
7132,high_143,client,well I probably feel we're not a good in the end
7133,high_143,counsellor,you know I can give you a lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down as a matter of fact some studies show that anxiety doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications so I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not
7134,high_143,client,I didn't really know that I just thought that that yoga was more about flexibility I didn't realize there were so many other benefits
7135,high_143,counsellor,okay so how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to ten
7136,high_143,client,well I probably if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine
7137,high_143,counsellor,good good that's a definite improvement and and you could determine after that first class whether you're levels have decreased or not and that would that be validation for you or would that be you give you even more motivation if your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class
7138,high_143,client,I think that would be a lot of motivation
7139,high_143,counsellor,okay to continue so one other thing that I wanted to to mention to you um was you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and I'm curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature
7140,high_143,client,wow it was only about minutes it was really cold and windy so we didn't want to stay out and by we I mean the dog and I
7141,high_143,counsellor,mmm-hmm and so because of it was cold and Wendy you decided to kind of cut the walk short
7142,high_143,client,yeah
7143,high_143,counsellor,and and that's definitely understandable I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day
7144,high_143,client,Wow it might help if I take a jacket next time
7145,high_143,counsellor,okay so if you took a check in case it's gold
7146,high_143,client,yeah
7147,high_143,counsellor,and do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful that you could be and that would help you even more enjoy it
7148,high_143,client,as long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better
7149,high_143,counsellor,okay
7150,high_143,client,and there's lots of trails around my house like that
7151,high_143,counsellor,okay excellent it's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise and so do you think you could commit to an hour probably and on a scale of one to ten tell me what that probably means
7152,high_143,client,um it's probably a ten I can I can to that
7153,high_143,counsellor,okay all right so it sounds like last week you had a few problems carrying out play assignments towards decreasing your anxiety you really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes but you you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home how strongly do you feel about doing them at home
7154,high_143,client,if I could do them at home I would probably do them all the time
7155,high_143,counsellor,"mm-hmm I think that would be a big difference and then there would be no embarrassment factor if you couldn't do the poses. Less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup, that's very good. And get out more with people. You've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people, not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know, you have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of one to ten, you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog. Job, I think we have a plan. So overall, on all four of these items, how motivated do you feel on a scale of one to ten?"
7156,high_143,client,I think it's a I think I can do them on all four all four
7157,high_143,counsellor,fabulous and how do you think you will feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week how much of a difference do you think it would make you feel
7158,high_143,client,I think it but maybe even make me look forward to doing these if I were doing them on a regular basis
7159,high_143,counsellor,mm-hmm and how would it make you feel
7160,high_143,client,I think it would make me feel really good
7161,high_143,counsellor,and so you feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would - very good
7162,high_143,client,thank you
7163,high_143,counsellor,we'll check in next week we'll make an appointment for next week and catch up and see how you're doing with all this good job
7164,high_143,client,thank you so much
7165,high_144,client,I was okay I guess
7166,high_144,counsellor,yeah just okay yeah all right okay I want to refresh your memory at not godly notes here do you mind if I refer to my notes
7167,high_144,client,what's good
7168,high_144,counsellor,oh we had developed for strategies to help you decrease the amount of marijuana if not cut it off altogether and one of the items were worlds were to run more you used to run a lot and you like to run and so we have realized that the marijuana use usage was merely a mask to self-medicate for the depression but we also know that running up serotonin and in many cases is just as good as an antidepressant so you're excited about this last week so I'm wondering how you made up with the running last week
7169,high_144,client,well it was raining out so I didn't really get around to it it was pretty cold
7170,high_144,counsellor,so yeah yeah and so because of the rain and the coldness it kind of took away from your from your mood and your motivation to go running
7171,high_144,client,yeah I wasn't in the mood
7172,high_144,counsellor,I'm wondering what you could have done to get in the mood
7173,high_144,client,I'm not sure what I could have done and so because of the not exercising
7174,high_144,counsellor,did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week
7175,high_144,client,yeah with what i use a bit more
7176,high_144,counsellor,okay okay so how would you tie those two things together by not running
7177,high_144,client,I think that it makes what I'm not exercising that generally I would turn to the more usage
7178,high_144,counsellor,yeah yeah so when you reflect back now on last week and the rain coming down and it was cold I'm wondering if there's a way that you could change your perception about that such that it wouldn't stop you from running how do you think
7179,high_144,client,yeah I could probably change the perception about that maybe wear a rain jacket or something
7180,high_144,counsellor,mm-hmm that would be a great idea that would be an excellent idea some people even think that it's fun running in the rain and the cold so that might that might absolutely be an alternative the other thing was to stay away from your friends that you would consider bad influences with using the marijuana how did you make out with that
7181,high_144,client,oh I tried to stay away but I didn't I still saw some of them
7182,high_144,counsellor,so it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life last week and can you tell me more about what was difficult about it
7183,high_144,client,well I just thought that they think something badly of the only one time to think avoiding or AZ
7184,high_144,counsellor,so you didn't it sounds like you didn't want to hurt their feelings three by them thinking that you were going to avoid them
7185,high_144,client,yeah
7186,high_144,counsellor,and so as a result of this what what happened
7187,high_144,client,oh well I just ended up going to see them yeah
7188,high_144,counsellor,and so because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them you ended up using marijuana is that correct
7189,high_144,client,yeah we did
7190,high_144,counsellor,yeah I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week
7191,high_144,client,oh well I could I suppose I could just try or not to go in and see little guys and what would that involve trying hard or not to go see them hmm i guess it's as simple as just not going
7192,high_144,counsellor,yeah sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment to yourself and just drawing the line and do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with
7193,high_144,client,yes yeah I do I don't see that often but I could I could go see it start to see that more
7194,high_144,counsellor,okay how motivated on a scale one to ten would you say you are too kind of reignite friendships with people with people that don't smoke pot
7195,high_144,client,maybe a vote of three
7196,high_144,counsellor,okay so you're still you're still a little iffy about you what about whether you want to associate with those friends again but I have to ask you Bruce what gee what made you say three instead of one
7197,high_144,client,well because i know i have pro so i feel like i need to i think i should start doing something about it I think
7198,high_144,counsellor,that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards the friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly and when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past what kind of things did you do what was your life like
7199,high_144,client,oh I like with what this kind of thing is activity is insane yeah was it fun being with them yeah it was fun yeah we just mostly like doing some activities maybe just sort of get some fresh air kind of thing usually it's a not so like you know there's more they tend to do more healthy activity
7200,high_144,counsellor,that would say so you can recall living up healthier life than and having fun of doors and basically having the healthier life overall without using the pot
7201,high_144,client,yeah I think I think that writer it could be a might take my mind off of it
7202,high_144,counsellor,mm-hmm sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the part because it makes you realize that you don't really need it and I think it's a great I think that's a great idea the other item on your goal whether it's a goal not an item was to get a pet how did you make out go and it was a dog you were going after a dog at the SPCA and how did you make out with that why was
7203,high_144,client,I really had a lot of second thoughts about it I was worried about commitment and and I kind of think so I didn't feel like that was the right idea
7204,high_144,counsellor,mm-hmm okay so you had some second thoughts about that you are excited about it in last week's session but after a chance to reflect upon it you kind of realize that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best thing for you
7205,high_144,client,well there's lark think there'd be a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I just don't have the motivation to to be put in I think that's why is to recognize that right up front I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage
7206,high_144,counsellor,I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider
7207,high_144,client,maybe maybe what what do you have in what I'm thinking do you like pets that are don't require such a commitment
7208,high_144,counsellor,that's a good idea
7209,high_144,client,I didn't think we'll that because a dog is the talk is a large commitment
7210,high_144,counsellor,yeah there's all kinds of animals and snakes or fish or something okay snakes are fish that would definitely be a star these animals that you like
7211,high_144,client,yeah
7212,high_144,counsellor,all right yeah I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to alright so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be asked and then from marijuana how did you make out with that
7213,high_144,client,well I looked into it but like I went to the first the first meeting and I just I felt like like those people were bought on the barrel and I was just not I just didn't fit in with that crowd just I'm not where they are that place
7214,high_144,counsellor,so you made the effort to go and you went but that was
7215,high_144,client,I couldn't I just didn't want it
7216,high_144,counsellor,and so we you didn't say the whole time and so you left early because you felt you didn't feel in you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning
7217,high_144,client,yeah yeah
7218,high_144,counsellor,I can definitely understand that. I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you. What do you think?
7219,high_144,client,yeah I can see there could be some positive I just don't I don't I just don't see it that much you at this point
7220,high_144,counsellor,mm-hmm and what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group
7221,high_144,client,why would I would probably be able to relate to people the same kind of situation oh maybe it's just a positive to be able to have connection with people
7222,high_144,counsellor,so you're you're saying that the positives of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey and do have connections with other people and again I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pod but from increasing the feel-good hormones in your body the connection and the relating to other people it might be similar when you are younger you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player and so you had support that was sort of like a the team was sort of like a support group I'm wondering if you could relate to people and had connections so I'm wondering if you could see a support group as a team
7223,high_144,client,yeah it would probably be the same kind of situation like essentially people in support group for all there for the same goal so it's kind of in hockey or embrace very with their win
7224,high_144,counsellor,mm-hmm and and do you remember when you were playing hockey how it felt to be encompassed in that team it's good it gave and that's because of those good feeling hormones that come and neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections so how committed do you think you are if I were to send you a list of support group so you could try out some others where there weren't the bottom of the barrel as you say there how committed do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week
7225,high_144,client,probably eight
7226,high_144,counsellor,yeah wow what made you see an eighth rather than a
7227,high_144,client,well just a team analogy i think is a good analogy
7228,high_144,counsellor,so you thought of how you remembered you remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection
7229,high_144,client,yeah and also you know i don't have to be the mean if if he said if I think of it as a team maybe I would be like a star on the team because I'm not quite so long barrel maybe
7230,high_144,counsellor,I love that analogy good thinking good thinking Bruce that's excellent Wow well just to summarize today you came then you had made some progress that you had some stumbling blocks um you have decided that whether it's rain or shine you're going to run anyway because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting a dog you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing ovation okay and in terms of a support group I will send you a list of support groups and you feel that on a scale of one to ten that you're about an eight and actually caring through and drying up two of these support groups because of the hockey team analogy great job so overall how would you rate today's session
7231,high_144,client,it was good very good
7232,high_144,counsellor,and if we were to put it on a scale again one to ten for debate
7233,high_144,client,about right
7234,high_144,counsellor,we did good that if we didn't eight glad you came in to Dave Bruce and I will see you next week and check up and we will we will see how you did with these goals and then we will move forward from there all right way to go
7235,high_144,client,thanks all right you
7236,high_145,client,hello there was a good say it's nice to see you but it's never good to go to the doctor
7237,high_145,counsellor,mmm unfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to be talking about ways to manage your blood clots and options for treatment but first I'd like to check in on a few things the first is your smoking you were at a half pack at during your last visit and we talked about how important it is for you to quit I'd say it's even more important now that smoking is associated with Davey T so have you quit
7238,high_145,client,no I haven't quit
7239,high_145,counsellor,so do you remember our conversation from our last visit that's when I give you the information about quitting smoking and the contact number for tobacco treatment specialist
7240,high_145,client,yes I remember but no I didn't quit and no I didn't call her
7241,high_145,counsellor,and why is that
7242,high_145,client,I'm not ready and I'm too upset to talk about this. I don't mean to be rude doctor but I've had a hard time lately and I'm not in the mood for you to get mad at me for not quitting. I'll let you know when I'm ready and we can talk about it. But here now today I'm here to talk about my blood clots.
7243,high_145,counsellor,well we're on the same page then because that's exactly why I'm talking to you about quitting smoking because smoking is a major risk factor for DVT even if you even if we treat you now if you don't quit smoking I'm afraid the blood clots will return again
7244,high_145,client,let's just talk about my treatment right now
7245,high_145,counsellor,hello Maria it's nice to see you again
7246,high_145,client,hello I wish I could say it's nice to see you but it's never good to have to come to the doctor
7247,high_145,counsellor,unfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to talk today about how to manage your blood clots and some options for treating but first I wanted to check in on your smoking status in our last visit I recommended that you begin to think about quitting and I would be interested in hearing your thoughts
7248,high_145,client,"well I haven't really thought about it actually I thought about canceling this appointment because I knew you were going to bring it up again talking about smoking with me is hard for you yes it's because you're going to tell me to quit like you always do and then it feels you're just like everyone else like my caseworker, the building manager everybody seems to think they know what I need to do and nobody thinks I know anything"
7249,high_145,counsellor,so when it comes to smoking you feel that other people want to tell you what to do and make your decisions for you you you don't feel heard or respected no respect that's it
7250,high_145,client,yes
7251,high_145,counsellor,well I just want to say that I am very glad you decided to come in today so we can take care of this blood clot because blood clots are very serious and I know you're concerned as your provider I have to be honest and say that smoking can cause blood clots but hopefully some of the information I give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking
7252,high_145,client,yeah
7253,high_145,counsellor,having said that I know my opinion is not the deciding factor quitting smoking is a decision only you can make
7254,high_145,client,well I'm really glad I came in I have to get this blood clot condition under control
7255,high_145,counsellor,I know that. Would it be okay with you if I share some information about smoking and blood clots? I can tell you what I know and then we'll see what you think.
7256,high_145,client,yes I don't know that I will quit but I will listen
7257,high_145,counsellor,so what do you think
7258,high_145,client,"I always thought that the blood clots came from my mother, hello, like passed down like genetics. I didn't know that smoking could cause this. I just thought that blood clots run in my family. I guess I also didn't get how dangerous this clotting."
7259,high_145,counsellor,can be you seem surprised and a little more aware now the smoking risks I guess so yes so Maria I'd like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking so on a scale of one to ten with one being you don't think it is at all important that you quit and ten being you're ready to quit today where would you put yourself
7260,high_145,client,well if you had asked me when I first came in i would have said less than one
7261,high_145,counsellor,but now i would have to say for why a four and not a lower number
7262,high_145,client,that's a good question let me think about it um I guess it's a four because of the blood clots the blood clots are really heavy on my mind right now
7263,high_145,counsellor,so having a better understanding of how smoking adds to the risk of blood clots increases your desire to quit or little
7264,high_145,client,yes
7265,high_145,counsellor,what else if anything makes quitting important to you
7266,high_145,client,you know the bigger thing for me is the fear of being evicted from my apartment there's a rule that we can't smoke in the house and I stick to it for the most part but the other day I smoked out the window and that was only the second time I've done it but don't you know the building manager caught me so now I am sure she's going to be watching me even more I can't lose my apartment
7267,high_145,counsellor,the possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upsets you in addition to your health
7268,high_145,client,I would hate to think that my son t and they lost their home because their mom chose smoking over a biting by a stupid code even if I hate that rule. I smoked when I was pregnant with them and thank you Holy Mother they were born healthy. I don't think I could live with myself if they lost their home because of something I'm doing.
7269,high_145,counsellor,so it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children it's obvious that you're a good mom and if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear so let me ask you a slightly different question on that same scale of one to ten how would you rate your confidence to quit
7270,high_145,client,Oh confidence oh I'd have to stay at two so you are not feeling very confident right now hello no not confident at all I mean I've tried to quit so many times and I just can't do it
7271,high_145,counsellor,so you've been persistent in trying and haven't been successful yet still you you said a two and not a one I'm curious about that
7272,high_145,client,well the only reason I said her too is that I tried quitting smoking when I was pregnant with santhi and they or both I went for two months without a cigarette with Dale and I didn't make it past that and that was really mad at myself for that I really wanted to quit from my babies and I failed I guess I'm just hopeless I mean who keeps smoking when there's a baby inside
7273,high_145,counsellor,it sounds like you really feel like you let yourself and your children down and that's hard to accept given how much you love your kids
7274,high_145,client,yes and I'm doing it again right now by not following the rules I'm addicted to cigarettes just like a drug addict in the end the cigarettes always win
7275,high_145,counsellor,so what what do you think sante and thao think about your smoking
7276,high_145,client,mmm Southee yells at me and sometimes they'll cries when I go out to smoke he says mama smoking is bad
7277,high_145,counsellor,so you know it would be best for you and your children if you quit if you had the right support and tools to manage this addiction if you believed you could do it you would
7278,high_145,client,I'd like to think so but I just don't think I can do it
7279,high_145,counsellor,you quit for two months when you were pregnant with Te'o how did you do it then
7280,high_145,client,I don't know and I just did it. I fought the urges with sucking on straws and some hard candies. I just did it.
7281,high_145,counsellor,wow so you were able to quit on your own for two months that's impressive have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support groups
7282,high_145,client,mmm no I think people can quit if they really want to I'm just too weak
7283,high_145,counsellor,ah wow you must be pretty hard on yourself what would you say if I told you that very few people only four percent of us are able to quit successfully cold turkey no really is that true hmm yes and and most people try many times before their successful their medications and groups yet and I'd be happy to share that information with you I'd like to help you if that's something that you'd like
7284,high_145,client,well I don't know I'm let me think about it can you give me the information again the booklets that brochure you gave me before I didn't want to tell you but I threw them away when I got home but I really want to read them this time
7285,high_145,counsellor,that's great maria you can look them over and i'll have our tobacco treatment specialist sonya follow up with you we have an excellent tobacco treatment program here and I am I believe that Sonya can help you quit when you're ready okay what one would be a good time to check back in she can call me next week and I'll let you know I may be ready to try again absolutely and I'll have Sonya call you I just want you to know that I understand how hard it is for you to talk about quitting smoking and I really appreciate it so would you like to talk about how to manage a blood clots
7286,high_145,client,yes that sounds
7287,high_145,counsellor,good all right
7288,high_146,client,I mean look I've made time in my day to come here
7289,high_146,counsellor,yeah I'm kept in your waiting room for minutes
7290,high_146,client,yeah it's not acceptable you know that I'm making a point where I'm I expect them to sit down at not quarter to
7291,high_146,counsellor,right and you so you're busy enough
7292,high_146,client,yeah I've got other things to do I got pants to do
7293,high_146,counsellor,I've got clients to coming in
7294,high_146,client,yeah you know and it wasn't necessarily easy for you to make the time to come down and you had to wait in the waiting room and now I raise the subject of wait
7295,high_146,counsellor,yeah I mean okay fair enough
7296,high_146,client,I've got to have my blood pressure the Oh medication change but I really haven't got time to talk about my weight. I mean you know I'm aware of my weight. I'm aware of the problems and I'm also aware of the solutions so I don't really need a discussion. it's it's just I've got too much to do at the moment you know.
7297,high_146,counsellor,right and so it's it's it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in
7298,high_146,client,yeah
7299,high_146,counsellor,and I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting well it's been it's bad form you know yeah yeah that's and that that's not easy for you because you you'd like to go really soon and Here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me
7300,high_146,client,yeah but basically I've got things to do I'll go back to the office I've got a pile of work that I've got to deal with yeah and every time every moment out of my day yeah means I have to work in the evening against
7301,high_146,counsellor,it counts when you're self-employed you ain't got a choice
7302,high_146,client,exactly exactly
7303,high_146,counsellor,it's up to you just a couple of minutes
7304,high_146,client,well I'm here now so yeah okay if it's a couple of minutes
7305,high_146,counsellor,yeah I promise okay because I really must get on I want I want to simply ask you how you feel about it about what what losing weight
7306,high_146,client,well obviously I want to UM yeah I mean who doesn't I mean I'm aware that I'm over my balance weight but I know that it's causing problems I mean obviously I get out of breath if I have to do something about Harry and I realize that I'm on this blood pressure right and maybe that's probably contributing to it
7307,high_146,counsellor,right you can see the links between your weight and your health and you'd like things to be
7308,high_146,client,yeah I mean there are other things but I mean yeah the weight is a something I would like to get hold of
7309,high_146,counsellor,you get on going to handle you'd like to if you could
7310,high_146,client,yeah I mean I know that the theories of a bit of exercise on a regular basis a balanced diet but unfortunately because of my lifestyle because of being self-employed as an accountant it's finding the time to exercise but also finding the time to sort of think okay I'm going to go shopping for this that in the other yeah prepare a meal yeah with me it's very often ready meals and that sort of thing yeah yeah food on the run you know grazing let me see if I can
7311,high_146,counsellor,summarize what you've said and then we'll see what next and you lead a busy life yeah you run a business and you've got a lot to do yeah and you you're aware of that of the links between your health and your weight and you are concerned to some extent about that and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it it's just that your life is busy and rushed and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done
7312,high_146,client,yeah I mean I to a certain extent because of my lifestyle food is just fuel yeah yeah you know because I'm juggling all these balls and I don't want to drop any I get it I get it
7313,high_146,counsellor,and so if you could fit it in you would like things to be different but that's not so easy no okay can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about this okay I'm up for that but it's going to be the same problem of a finding time and B if I make an appointment
7314,high_146,client,I don't expect to be kept waiting for half an hour there whatever because it's exactly
7315,high_146,counsellor,I tell you what might be a nice solution is if you come down first appointment and I give you an appointment at and anger then they'll be absolutely no waiting. The purpose of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work life that you've got. I'll maybe have a look at my schedules see whether anything can be arranged or I can pass something on to some and and so right so it's not a wasted interview. So I come here so I've looked at my schedules I've looked at things good whatever good and see if you can fix it up and also give some thought to what we've talked about. Yeah of course good stuff.
7316,high_146,client,okay okay thanks sorry I went up a bit
7317,high_147,client,hmm pretty good
7318,high_147,counsellor,would you like to drag this out what do you think all that was fixed
7319,high_147,client,really nice
7320,high_147,counsellor,yeah you got rid of that bed yes coloration it was there ya know like that it went well good excellent I did notice quite a lot of staining actually I'm wondering what are your thoughts about what might be related to that
7321,high_147,client,hmm well the usual suspects smoking wine coffee
7322,high_147,counsellor,yeah all of the above any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time
7323,high_147,client,yeah I thought about it I'm just it's not my cup I just I hear from everybody and I've tried I've tried before didn't work I get it all the time okay and it's like Here I am one more person the next the next doctor who's saying you need to be
7324,high_147,counsellor,David mm-hmm and I'm sorry that's not how I mean to come across it
7325,high_147,client,I I know I'm not an idiot and people know that smokers are you know how can you smoke today it's just not that easy to quit
7326,high_147,counsellor,mm-hmm
7327,high_147,client,and if it was as easy as a doctor saying or or your partner saying I who wouldn't be happy I'd be a real fool not to do it it was gonna make it like that yeah I just hear it every day
7328,high_147,counsellor,yeah and what's been your past experience with smoking tell me can you tell me a little bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life how long you've smoked
7329,high_147,client,we have smoked for years since I was
7330,high_147,counsellor,mm-hmm
7331,high_147,client,and quit a couple of times off and on twenties but you know it's been consistent and I can't see myself changing now mm-hmm no matter what kind of talk I get or what they come up with it sounds like almost you've tried a lot of things that are out there and it's not something I can work for me
7332,high_147,counsellor,yeah yeah no
7333,high_147,client,yeah I know cold turkey is probably the only thing that's ever going to do it anybody that's done it myself in my group it's been cold turkey and then they fight it but it's my choice
7334,high_147,counsellor,mm-hmm
7335,high_147,client,and I don't like lectures about it
7336,high_147,counsellor,yeah and it really is your choice you're absolutely right that nobody has the right to tell you what to do can I ask if you were to if there was to be a situation where you decided I must quit what what would that situation be
7337,high_147,client,hard to tell because I've already had open-heart surgery that didn't do it mm-hmm prostate cancer that didn't do it right I don't know but I really don't know I just don't really want it
7338,high_147,counsellor,mm-hmm so this is something that you you have to pretty much see yourself doing for
7339,high_147,client,yeah a while credit while yet
7340,high_147,counsellor,yeah okay well I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it and I get that right now this is not something that you want to pursue would it be okay if I brought it up in our next visit because I I know that you've said you don't want to lecture but on the other hand I am I am concerned
7341,high_147,client,okay I could go for that I I'm always open to something you know to listen as long as I don't talk to yes okay he could be options I had some I had my surgeon just go like you're like why do I even keep you as a patient hmm he's good though you were glad again as a doctor
7342,high_147,counsellor,yeah yeah well and David honestly wherever you're at will work with it um and so thanks for thanks for taking a couple minutes and talking about smoking
7343,high_147,client,thanks doc okay
7344,high_148,client,okay
7345,high_148,counsellor,this will help keep your body strong resilience outside of the clinic so that hopefully your previous recording better back pain did not return okay so before we do this I'd like to re-explore why you saw no physical therapy in the first place ok this is sound okay to you
7346,high_148,client,yeah it does you know the you know ever since the new year I've been trying to get back into you know being more active than playing basketball and all that stuff but I've been seems like I'm hitting a wall quite a bit okay I have a lot of obstacles and having trouble getting through it okay
7347,high_148,counsellor,well tell me more about the kinds of things that you were doing and why he seems to be hitting these road bumps along the way
7348,high_148,client,so as you as you know my body's been playing you know basketball pick up and I've been trying to do trying to do that and that's caused me some back pain in the past and it's been a struggle for me to do that so I went the doctor and the doctor gave me some some pain medication and the pain medication worked for for a while but it seemed like it didn't really take care of it so then I started I try I try to try to do basketball again but then I had more pain from that so I'm really stuck with with going back to basketball because of the pain
7349,high_148,counsellor,well it sounds like you really struggled it back get back into a more active lifestyle and understand how difficult it is to overcome these roadblocks and then SAT all over again so tell me everything else is going are you eating well sleeping well are there any other stressors in your life
7350,high_148,client,well I have been trying to eat better but it's been quite difficult to maintain for a pro for a long period of time work is getting busier and I'm getting closer to about six hours a night but sleep things definitely isn't the best for me you know I feel much better when I'm exercising but when this back pain calm down everything just seems to fall apart and definitely makes me less active
7351,high_148,counsellor,well you did have some success and you felt much better when you initially tried to become more active
7352,high_148,client,yeah I did I definitely felt a lot better felt like I was like turning a new chapter in my life and I'd like to thank that I was being more proactive about my health
7353,high_148,counsellor,okay well it sounds like you realize that when you started with change these aspects of your life you felt much better and that it was going to affect your overall health but it's recurring back pain that you experienced was stopping you in your tracks so tell me what do you think that you're experiencing these recurring go to back pain in the first place
7354,high_148,client,"I don't think I was in the proper physical shape to be playing basketball with my friends you know. I said I'd up at a desk for about eight hours a day and I go from there to play in basketball. The rest and the medications did have some positive effects initially but it seemed like they were not helping overall. Yes, a pain came right back."
7355,high_148,counsellor,"I think I think your life you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem. It sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a threat and that something needs to change. There are many other things I played two white pain comes about. For example how much stress you're under, your productivity level, how much sleep you're getting, your emotional health, they all play a big role as well. You know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain. I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pickup basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day. Does this make sense to you?"
7356,high_148,client,yes I definitely think so I mean working eight hours a day and going to play basketball my body
7357,high_148,counsellor,we're not ready for them definitely you know because many factors influence pain we have a lot of options on how to decrease pain and make sure that it doesn't return now you're doing very well about being proactive about getting back into a more active lifestyle but i think that the physical capability of your body just wasn't there yet to jump into playing basketball with your friends at that intensity and i think that was a big reason why you experience back pain in the first place and also why it's been recurring what's your impression on that
7358,high_148,client,well i definitely understand that you know i really have an exercise in a couple of years and because everything's been pretty crazy at home very hectic lots of hours at home doing work the kids have been busy things that in the job is very busy just hectic I thought playing basketball be great for me I think it is but I definitely wasn't ready to step right back in and then didn't realize my body needed more more preparedness to give into that program
7359,high_148,counsellor,you have to think of your body is a complex ecosystem where a number of different factors mixed to create your pain you know as we touched on before things like how much stress you're under your emotional health your beliefs and aggravating activities in your case basketball they all come into play so we really don't know exactly how pain is influenced by all of these different factors but we do know that it's very helpful to address many areas of your life but as we spoke about before these factors all interrelate so when it hurts you stop exercising which changes your general wellness your mood and your social supports and so on so forth but it's important to note though that things can change you know so we can start with your activities you know what do you think that you can do in order to be more physically active but reduce the risk of the back pain returning and the additional negative effects
7360,high_148,client,well I guess I could go for short walks with my wife after work definitely be less stress on my body and be some type of exercise for me in terms of work it would make sense if I got up once in a while from my chair and just walk around I think that would be it would make sense and it'd be good for me
7361,high_148,counsellor,"Great, it sounds like we're off to a great start. It's important to note though that there are many different exercises that can help you. You know you need to gradually expose yourself to increasingly demanding tasks. You know, start with walking. Let your body adapt. As you build tolerance, you can keep moving forward. So let me ask you, how important is it to you to improve your consistency with exercise in order to enhance your health?"
7362,high_148,client,yeah certainly I definitely feel that consistency is important I'm tired of starting and stopping starting and stopping I definitely want to be more consistent
7363,high_148,counsellor,brilliance you've got the consistency is key you know so how how often do you think that you'll be able to exercise
7364,high_148,client,well my wife walks four or five times a week in each time she walks is about minutes I could probably do that also I work I think I could get up and walk around every up at least once every hour
7365,high_148,counsellor,it sounds like a brilliant start so let me ask you on a scale of 0 to 10 being not confident at all and 10 being one hundred percent confident how confident are you that you would be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime
7366,high_148,client,I would probably say about a six or seven
7367,high_148,counsellor,well you're not a zero that tells me you've got some conference in making a change let me ask you why are you confident
7368,high_148,client,you know as I said before I'm tired of starting stopping and I'm just tired that and I also i think i could lose i could use to lose a few pounds
7369,high_148,counsellor,okay so you realize that if you become more consistent with exercise and moving more work you're going to feel better and you're held to be impacted positively
7370,high_148,client,yes I definitely think so
7371,high_148,counsellor,but you're not a that tells me that there may be some obstacles your success what would it take for you to be a or even eight or nine
7372,high_148,client,i think if i get my my whole family involved that will certainly helped also if i can set you know small realistic goals for myself i think that will keep keep me motivated you know in the past you know let me talk about a few times already that you know I'm always stopping and starting I think if I if I do those things I won't i won't do that and also i think that i'll stay more motivated and there to help you probably lead myself to better healthier lifestyle
7373,high_148,counsellor,"Brilliant. I get the impression that you want to stay on course and starting an exercise regime and experience in less pain. The best way to do this is, as we said, staying consistent and setting small goals for yourself to keep motivated. You know your ecosystem will adapt to be more active and you slowly begin to do more and your pain will slowly begin to subside. During this progression, it's important to note as well to keep slowly building up and not to put a limit on what you can do later down the road. As of a bill conference and increases strength and resiliency of your body. So if I saw you in two weeks, what would you tell me with regards to how your new exercise regime is going?"
7374,high_148,client,I will tell you that I'm consistent I will tell you I'm feeling much better I'll tell you I would probably have little pain if any I'll tell you I'm more active In an overall just tell you I'm very healthy
7375,high_148,counsellor,good good sounds brilliant you know so using that same scale from to he'll conference are you that you'll be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime
7376,high_148,client,definitely attend definitely i agree you know overall most comments in your brain
7377,high_148,counsellor,let's see you in two weeks crazy idea
7378,high_148,client,okay perfect thank you no problem
7379,high_149,client,well there's a lot going on with the court stuff that I got going on and you know looking at possible jail time and you know talking with my lawyer and with that you know it's just really stressful and it makes me want to drink again and i know i shouldn't but just you know all this stress with everything that's going on you know that's the only way I you know I if I could just have like you know maybe a glass of wine or something that might help me feel better and understand things but I also know that I was you know that's kind of what got me into this situation you know I was out with my friends and I had like eight glasses of wine and tried to drive home so I know that I shouldn't be doing it so I'm kind of you know I know the difference I know I should be going you know working out but it's still it's easier just to have a glass of wine and you know just try to think things out that way
7380,high_149,counsellor,so you're realizing all these things that are ramifications of the DUI are really positive stress wants or trigger you to drink but at the same time you really realize this is something you probably shouldn't do and that's ultimately important to you
7381,high_149,client,yes I you know I can since we talked the last time I can definitely see you know how my drinking has kind of led up to where I'm at now and you know that maybe there's different ways that I can deal with things instead of just wanting to have a drink
7382,high_149,counsellor,mm-hmm that's so good good insight and it sounds like you're still kind of on the fence um we do permission I'd like to ask if I could possibly use a tool that's worked pretty well for some other books it's called a decisional balance scale and it sort of helps you weigh out both sides of the issue so eun hye fellow a more comfortable and privacy explore reasons to change and what would happen if you didn't if you did change and then also reasons for not changing what what happened if you get that is that something with you willing to do today
7383,high_149,client,yeah I mean we can look at that I do it kind of in my head anyway so I'm getting it out on paper would give me a visual to kind of wrestling back to
7384,high_149,counsellor,okay are you comfortable writing or would you prefer me to
7385,high_149,client,I um I can write
7386,high_149,counsellor,ok so let's start what about reasons to change what's going on
7387,high_149,client,um reasons to change what we could be you know just spiritually and physically a healthier person
7388,high_149,counsellor,okay what does that mean
7389,high_149,client,when I'm drinking I don't feel like I want to go to church or you know connect with other people who don't drink so you know I kind of lost that ambition to you know want to be around people who aren't drinking so it would get me back into their social groups
7390,high_149,counsellor,good so to open up your social atmosphere baby
7391,high_149,client,yeah
7392,high_149,counsellor,that's more of a positive influence and something that's sort of you know makes you fit in but doesn't necessarily make you feel good about yourself
7393,high_149,client,yes you know and I've lost that one less for five years
7394,high_149,counsellor,okay anything else do you like bad
7395,high_149,client,um I think I would be able to you know be a better role model for people if I was you know if I could change even my drinking I would be able to you know be making an inspiration to others
7396,high_149,counsellor,so that would be a positive okay you like to give back some of this experience
7397,high_149,client,yeah just in that sense is that I've you know a lot of family members drinks so I think you know maybe if I quit or if I could you know where's the skills that maybe you know with that I could help other people my family
7398,high_149,counsellor,so maybe breaking the cycle of what's happened to you for
7399,high_149,client,yeah yeah
7400,high_149,counsellor,that would be a positive spoons of a very good husband and some reason it would be really truly meaningful to that spiritual side you mentioned before
7401,high_149,client,yeah
7402,high_149,counsellor,okay um anything else before we want to kind of what can happen if you do change know that that's a good that's a good cap solution okay so if you do these things what do you think is going to kind of an outcome just to kind of sum up we have said
7403,high_149,client,I think I would um I would be a more of a leader than inspiration as in people
7404,high_149,counsellor,okay your family members maybe people in a you really want to be anything
7405,high_149,client,yeah I do I mean I've seen other people you not to talk with you and you know other people have shown me how it would be or how fulfilling it would be if I you know inspire some change within myself and if I do that I would like to give back
7406,high_149,counsellor,so your associate for fulfillment throughout this process
7407,high_149,client,yeah some sort of you know learning experience something take away from what's happened
7408,high_149,counsellor,okay very good things anything else that you feel like maybe these things you'll do you mention kind of some legal stuff over here is there anything that you want to add about that here or is that not important
7409,high_149,client,i think if i change I would get I would be out of the legal system you know I don't want to be on probation I don't want to be paying these fines they take a lot for my schooling my work you know my my family life so being done with that legal aspect would be something that I would definitely look forward to
7410,high_149,counsellor,okay just being able to get back to your life of things that you know
7411,high_149,client,yeah I run to you i don't know like work like family yeah because it's you know I've not a high-risk insurance I have to go do extra meetings and go the group panels and it's just you know this is all added so much more to my life guess it's not that you're not very excited about something no and but i do want to take it as a learning experience so I don't want it to have to do this again
7412,high_149,counsellor,okay so you want to get a learning experience out of it yes all right anything else you want to add this box or should we can review what you wrote
7413,high_149,client,that's yeah that's reviewing okay I don't remember one already
7414,high_149,counsellor,so just to kind of sum up you talk first about reasons not to change is that's kind of where your abs and then we also talked about reasons to change in this kind of writing won't go that was like so you mentioned that you the reasons you might not want changes it doesn't make you feel better when you're stressed out to drink it relaxes you it makes me feel like you can handle things yes um they're also keeps your same social Farrah social sphere of people that you trust and that you enjoyed spending time with and it gives you a way to fit in with those people
7415,high_149,client,yeah and that's you know it's where i'm at right now on this i feel and people i like to be around
7416,high_149,counsellor,and you're comfortable there
7417,high_149,client,yes
7418,high_149,counsellor,okay um the results of not changing your brought out for that if things were to keep going the same way they are that you might get in more legal trouble especially after you have more serious but on the flip side you'd also keep the fence and filling them up don't worry about trying to be that change in the waters
7419,high_149,client,yeah ok I'm going to the next side that sounds right
7420,high_149,counsellor,and you mentioned that if you did change that you would feel like you're more spiritually and physically healthier which meant having a more open social clear positive people to you
7421,high_149,client,yeah
7422,high_149,counsellor,and then you would be a better inspiration to others and that you might break the cycles in the family issues the patent paths that you've sort of perpetuating right now yeah underneath you feel a little uncertain about your going forward and and then if you did those things that you would feel you more a leader and inspiration to people around you and not really meant to you've been example to others in searching with them fulfillment in this process here you'd also mention that you would get a legal system you know you would have fines be done with all that stuff and not have any of the added pressures that being in the legal system puts on you yes and then you really get a learning experience out of the situation you can really apply for other things in your life
7423,high_149,client,I would I think I will you know once this is all over with you know hopefully I'll look back and be like that was something that I did and I did
7424,high_149,counsellor,wonderful
7425,high_150,counsellor,sounds like you've been in a lot of pain and it's made it pretty difficult to do some of the things you normally do so tell me a little bit about your routine and and what your pain is like
7426,high_150,client,well I used to be able to go outside no jog around I play some sports and my friends every so often but I can't do anything now besides just lay in my bed
7427,high_150,counsellor,"sounds like you're really acted before and this pain is really causing a lot of problems for you if you would rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10, where would you say your level is"
7428,high_150,client,on average seven and eight usually sometimes less sometimes more
7429,high_150,counsellor,okay so pretty high levels of pain
7430,high_150,client,yeah and nothing makes it better except when I take oxy and smoke some weed
7431,high_150,counsellor,what kinds of things have you been doing to manage your pain
7432,high_150,client,oh that's taking the oxy you prescribed and smoking some weed you know every now and then again to just ease the pain
7433,high_150,counsellor,okay so you you're taking the oxy you're smoking some weed can you tell me a little bit how you been taking your medications and how often you're smoking
7434,high_150,client,"I mean I'm taking the oxy just as you prescribed, one every four hours. Just the bottle says smoke weed maybe three or four times a day just to take the edge off. What other kinds of things have you been trying to manage your pain right now? There was the hot and cold treatment, but I just felt like a waste of time. So did the topical cream, it's just a waste of money."
7435,high_150,counsellor,ok so the hot and cold didn't seem to work the topical cream didn't seem to work and it sounds like you've been taking the axion smoking some weed and that's been a little bit helpful tell me what else you've tried for your pain nothing else besides that really like
7436,high_150,client,i said the oxy and the weed it's hard for me to it was hard for me to even to walk here
7437,high_150,counsellor,now i'm curious if you had a magic wand and you were able to wake up tomorrow and your life was different what would it look like
7438,high_150,client,I'd be outside again playing sports and my friends just enjoying life getting back to the things that just haven't been able to do
7439,high_150,counsellor,Steven I think those are really great goals and I think those are things we need to be working towards and as your doctor I also need to share with you that I'm concerned that you're still on the oxycodone six months out from your injury six months really isn't that long
7440,high_150,client,and i'm still in pain and I mean if I wasn't in pain I wouldn't be taking it you know it's your it's your prescription I don't I don't know what else to do I need relief
7441,high_150,counsellor,well I'm not trying to push you but I do think it's important for us to think about pain management that is not going to cause you more problems and it's going to allow you to get back to the lifestyle that you really want to be living what kinds of things do you think would be helpful
7442,high_150,client,I really don't know I am out of ideas
7443,high_150,counsellor,okay
7444,high_150,client,it's not my fault I'm in this much pain you should have known if I was going to get addicted
7445,high_150,counsellor,why didn't you tell me
7446,high_150,client,well and I'm sorry
7447,high_150,counsellor,Stephen I don't mean to be pushing you but I do want to talk about maybe what the the next steps would be to be helpful for you
7448,high_150,client,well if you have any recommendations i'd be willing to hear
7449,high_150,counsellor,i think it's really important that we choose a plan that you feel like you're able to do that works with you and you feel capable of following through with now thinking about what you've done already what do you feel like would be helpful at this point
7450,high_150,client,really anything that keeps me out of the pain I mean would you have any recommendations I'd be glad to hear them
7451,high_150,counsellor,great i do i'd actually love to share some information with you from the Center for Disease Control they have some guidelines about how we approach pain management in situations like this would it be okay if I talk with you about that
7452,high_150,client,yeah yes okay
7453,high_150,counsellor,so what the the guidelines do say is that for people who have had injuries like yours but we want to be using prescription pain medications in a certain period of time where it's effective and that tends to be six weeks so we're beyond that at this point now from that point what we like to do is transition you to over-the-counter medication so taper off the oxy and go to things like tylenol a leave and motrin and do that in combination with some holistic therapies like we've talked about before you know when people are on the oxy for longer than six months we put you at risk for some opiate dependence and some other health concerns
7454,high_150,client,I think that what would make sense
7455,high_150,counsellor,at this point is to think about transitioning you off of the oxy onto one of these over-the-counter medications and using some of these other techniques to help you manage the pain what do you think about those guidelines and maybe that plan
7456,high_150,client,I I could agree with them it's just this holistic therapies you talked about require a lot of movement and without that pain relief i don't know how i would get through it
7457,high_150,counsellor,yeah i hear that it's scary to to maybe do anything that might increase your pain that makes a lot of sense and i'm not opposed to prescribing you some some other medications for pain but as your medical provider i also have to say that I don't think smoking marijuana is the best means to manage your pain right now and I'm wondering what you think about making some of these changes
7458,high_150,client,yeah i'd be willing to try anything to get rid of this pain if you really think that's the best option then i will listen to you
7459,high_150,counsellor,i do and i think we need to think about what you're willing to do what you're able to do and what you feel like you can do most consistently so it sounds like at this point we're thinking about tapering off the oxy getting you on to something like tylenol and doing some exercise that you feel like you can do how do you feel about this plan
7460,high_150,client,i'd be willing to try the holistic exercises you were talking about taking tylenol but if I'm in pain that I'm going to call you absolutely
7461,high_150,counsellor,and I want you to call me and I think it actually makes sense for us to set a time within the next week for us to talk maybe do a phone check in and see how you're doing and even if you're not doing any better and then we can take it from there and see what changes we need to make to the plan
7462,high_150,client,great
7463,high_150,counsellor,well I have to say I'm really glad that you came in and I think it's very courageous to take the step and facing some of this pain as well to get you back to the life that you really want to be living right now so I thank you for coming in and I'll see you
7464,high_151,client,I'm good thanks for asking
7465,high_151,counsellor,I understand you come here today today's antsy because you had a recent arrest
7466,high_151,client,yeah I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol marijuana
7467,high_151,counsellor,how come on marijuana how recently was this do you like about we could uh okay so what's been going on what happens
7468,high_151,client,um well I am gonna have to go to course there and I know that are probably going to have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so are just I'm just coming here because I know maybe I can like get out of it from getting some type of treatment but oh yeah get out of it
7469,high_151,counsellor,you mean get a discharge?
7470,high_151,client,yeah I mean I feel like they're probably going to make me like go to rehab or something like that I'll want to do that
7471,high_151,counsellor,so you feel like you can get out of the rehab are too
7472,high_151,client,um I don't know I really am not sure i just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make a change in terms not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life
7473,high_151,counsellor,"Alright, so with this recent arrest, we realize it may be value to stop using. The joy don't want to."
7474,high_151,client,mmhmm yeah
7475,high_151,counsellor,so you're stuck there
7476,high_151,client,yeah kind of like I was like realize that like drinking into you marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know it just that's all I do usually employed an exam or like
7477,high_151,counsellor,feel better when you drink you ever socialize at the same time
7478,high_151,client,I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most times just like that I have alone city of the marijuana. Yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself. I'm a smoke everyday.
7479,high_151,counsellor,so thought it was what people are doing it so does it sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using not really so what are you losing
7480,high_151,client,I kind of just like to use it to like cope. I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago and like it still causes pain. And that's just the only thing that ever seems to help. Once after an injury this is alcohol marijuana.
7481,high_151,counsellor,so you take it for pain relief equalities
7482,high_151,client,yeah
7483,high_151,counsellor,any other reasons?
7484,high_151,client,um it's just easier it's just the marijuana leaf relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when i'm using forget about problems yeah
7485,high_151,counsellor,so it affects your mood in a positive way
7486,high_151,client,yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I'll have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings
7487,high_151,counsellor,have you used since you had to do you
7488,high_151,client,I um I haven't drank but I looked like I cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using alright in a bit of a situation
7489,high_151,counsellor,alright so you have the use that takes away pain for you
7490,high_151,client,it takes my anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law yeah how do you figure those two things out I don't know I don't know if there's always see your wholesome hours no like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking on using marijuana he had imagined all right
7491,high_151,counsellor,so you can't imagine that so is look at the other side can you imagine having further instance with law enforcement we're charges in the future
7492,high_151,client,if I hadn't really sort of that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible to not get any more charges or anything like that not be in the situation again
7493,high_151,counsellor,so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence and you'll be more careful in the future
7494,high_151,client,I don't know yeah I guess so. I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just working like right before. Try to like avoid that situation again.
7495,high_151,counsellor,so with that thinking you continue to use as you were that you take out the part that got you in trouble
7496,high_151,client,yeah
7497,high_151,counsellor,the first you have to get out of trouble this time yep so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it
7498,high_151,client,I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I took mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like it's my friends called me up and said hey you would want to go out tonight like not drinking with them
7499,high_151,counsellor,so there's a social component here
7500,high_151,client,yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekend things like all my friends who I do have it all to drink
7501,high_151,counsellor,alright so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends mm-hmm how would they respond if you went out with them
7502,high_151,client,I didn't drink um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out and we got like really drunken. I would just feel like ass please so it'd be socially awkward. Yeah straining the relationships with your friends.
7503,high_151,counsellor,so the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good rap for you know but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second guess some of it
7504,high_151,client,yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change of making
7505,high_151,counsellor,so you need to make some change
7506,high_151,client,yeah
7507,high_151,counsellor,but not the alcohol and drugs
7508,high_151,client,yeah alcohaulin I want something else could change yeah I don't know what
7509,high_151,counsellor,but you have any theories
7510,high_151,client,um I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's literally got me into situation that was other than that not really and I really never thought of what I could do
7511,high_151,counsellor,so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the name
7512,high_151,client,I might just not go anywhere ever. I'm not sure drivers often because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel.
7513,high_151,counsellor,okay so that strategy might not work that's something you've been tossed around though this ideas isolate a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of ground yeah that just such as mayor's it seemed that way to you too now that I'm like talking through it
7514,high_151,client,yeah as I don't think I have any choice really you know of any choice what's gonna happen is going to happen I don't know
7515,high_151,counsellor,oh really oh alright so what store do we know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the deal I what do you think you could do that would make a bad impression
7516,high_151,client,go to court strong test positive as I get drug tested that would do it get another DUI in the meantime I would look good either
7517,high_151,counsellor,alright so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want to do those things would it be acceptable to do this thing's anyone
7518,high_151,client,I mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the knowledge drunk driving enough or maybe not to wreck the day of my court date but I don't know about the holy SH marijuana part tougher
7519,high_151,counsellor,yeah all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going the court chug yeah goals that you could get behind home come in
7520,high_151,client,I can try I guess to like think about it and try to get out. I know I'm going to stress out the day of my court date.
7521,high_151,counsellor,well it's gonna be hard to like not turn that day you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea this is really tough for you if the alcohol and the marijuana that are important to you yeah this hold this so do you I think it's really just encroached on somebody at going on that you enjoyed yeah so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does that change things
7522,high_151,client,I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it centered dealing with it. I mean if I like don't go to quarter into that's going to warrant out for me. I can't it can't wait this situation.
7523,high_151,counsellor,what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in the more marijuana period like it's either that you obey those rules or or jail now so they wouldn't get to that
7524,high_151,client,I know it possibly could it's probably well but i don't know i would think it all certainly would ya yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I was like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when i get home for the next day or the next day let's go back a couple of steps
7525,high_151,counsellor,how long have you been used in the alcohol marijuana
7526,high_151,client,for about like six years six years
7527,high_151,counsellor,have ever until now with the DUI have you ever envision stopping know what's your plan like pre do you i will is your plan in all this
7528,high_151,client,I just kinda like the drinking kind of has gotten worse wasn't always that bad if only g marijuana but the alcohol i guess i've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really expected my life too much but i guess the alcohol has been a little bit more
7529,high_151,counsellor,yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah weird years to come
7530,high_151,client,yeah I didn't really have any like I never liked thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or this home now yeah could this be in a strange way like an opportunity I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop
7531,high_151,counsellor,if you really wanted to stop could you stop
7532,high_151,client,I don't know magus. I could try but I don't have the one.
7533,high_151,counsellor,you could give a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it
7534,high_151,client,yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know it's just unknown yeah
7535,high_151,counsellor,yeah so what do you want to go from here you have this to you I I imagine a hearing some time coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you
7536,high_151,client,I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop trickier ease and ROK's. I mean that might be something that I have to do. Right now I don't really want to. Don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually.
7537,high_151,counsellor,you want to stop it be easier to actually do it then like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality
7538,high_151,client,yeah
7539,high_151,counsellor,okay do you want to work on that
7540,high_151,client,yeah I think that'd be good
7541,high_151,counsellor,alright so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up no they're not for like a few more weeks few more weeks hi so I'll see you again and I have the iop and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just slumming now okay thanks Mel B
7542,high_151,client,thank you
7543,high_152,client,sure
7544,high_152,counsellor,okay so we're working on point scale of one to ten one being not important can be very important one being not confident one being very confident so on a scale of one to ten which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the low-risk lifts
7545,high_152,client,i would say an eight
7546,high_152,counsellor,you'd say an eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels
7547,high_152,client,I would say a amount of four
7548,high_152,counsellor,okay and so let's look at those to hear you're thinking it's pretty important but your confidence is down here but a four but it's not a one what makes you confident that you can drink the low risk levels under you remember what those are
7549,high_152,client,I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family. I really don't want to go down that path. I'm confident that I can change that at this point.
7550,high_152,counsellor,okay so that gives you good reason not to drink okay anything else
7551,high_152,client,well I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with and I think what I hang out with them it's an issue so that also helps me
7552,high_152,counsellor,so you have a support group that gives you the ability to have funded still drink yeah below risk levels
7553,high_152,client,yep
7554,high_152,counsellor,okay anything else
7555,high_152,client,nope now
7556,high_152,counsellor,let's look at your self evaluation of your birth control of use so now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control so on the scale of one to how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant
7557,high_152,client,I would say an eight and eight
7558,high_152,counsellor,okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time to you that you can use detective birth control every time every time we is sick correctly as its prescribed
7559,high_152,client,probably a probably a
7560,high_152,counsellor,ok so you're pretty confident that you can do it and why are you s and not a or
7561,high_152,client,I'm a because I think if I drink less I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm I drank too much and I don't really care too much.
7562,high_152,counsellor,ok so it's kind of link to your drinking the fact that that you can if you can take care of that drinking you can take care of the earth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here yes very good so it looks like you're using a good method of birth control you're just not able to use it effectively and you've linked it back here to the drinking so would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use of this today before I leave
7563,high_152,client,yes ok
7564,high_152,counsellor,ok and if you need more information we can get that for you ok
7565,high_152,client,ok
7566,high_153,counsellor,you've been working real hard
7567,high_153,client,sometimes I can't come home for dinner so I'm having a lot of you a police or someone like that she seemed to have a problem or don't see the big deal
7568,high_153,counsellor,okay and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning to you right now and about that
7569,high_153,client,I've definitely done my work is really manual labor intensive so I'm usually working it out and in Ostend the gorge of the day so he was sweating out any like bad things up in my system
7570,high_153,counsellor,so okay have you noticed putting on any weight a little bit but nothing too blue okay okay and how about hope to see his doctor have you gone to visit a bit of dark driving last year for physical but being everything showed up to be following that you feel good you feel good okay that's what I hear is that you you feel like your wife might be overreacting to this
7571,high_153,client,well minato really over right no no no she was being a no-shoe
7572,high_153,counsellor,she wants for you to live a long time and be healthy but it's sometimes special you work hard
7573,high_153,client,on when I kind of going out to eat these places kind of in a little bit better better situations
7574,high_153,counsellor,Sure sure okay um and so one thing I just like to do is maybe give you some information on baby obesity or diabetes. That you're interested or open to that at your shirt.
7575,high_153,client,so I guess the issue is that you know my doctor seems to think that my blood pressure was a little high but I really don't think that there's a problem and you know I eat really well and you know she suggested that I watch my caffeine but really caffeine is not a problem for me
7576,high_153,counsellor,okay but we were talking a little bit earlier earlier in our conversation you had said that you didn't feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation so it's a little bit of
7577,high_153,client,I'm not sure
7578,high_153,counsellor,so where are we did did you do you feel like you do have some agitation on the coffee or is it just no problem at all
7579,high_153,client,well you know sometimes it makes me a little jittery and you don't have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers but and working in the hospital they don't really look so highly on a good bathroom frequently but you know it keeps me awake it keeps me aware it makes me more able to like you do my job better and so I really don't see that it's a real issue I mean maybe my blood pressure is a little high but yeah so let me see about half this
7580,high_153,counsellor,so you see you got some positives the awareness and if you feel kind of on your game and then there's some negatives with you know your coworkers that they don't you know that your boss may not want you you know check it out the hospital floor for yeah yeah and then the blood pressure thing is that sound about right
7581,high_153,client,yeah yeah well you know and sometimes like I said it does kind of make me a little jittery and I'm not not use relax but you know I really like it and like I said it makes me more aware what's going on and I feel like I'm much more observant
7582,high_153,counsellor,yeah how about frequency if you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking
7583,high_153,client,yeah about four cups a day
7584,high_153,counsellor,okay that feels about right to you
7585,high_153,client,yeah I mean I'd I mean the co-workers that work at night gosh they bring in a carafe
7586,high_153,counsellor,yeah what would happen if you if you looked at maybe reducing that with that habit would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic the number yeah yeah but you're training for a day you're probably have that morning cup
7587,high_153,client,I really you know I really like waking up and that whole ritual so I definitely don't want to get that up. I gotcha okay so that was important yeah and then of course you know working a -hour shift. I really think that you know the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is a really good idea too. I can probably give up the mid-morning.
7588,high_153,counsellor,that's great yeah yeah I think so so you've identified one of the four that might you might be willing to to try for a while to let go of what do you what do you think of that sounds alright so you're sick of this
7589,high_153,client,yeah I I can't shoplift anymore and I got I got cold again and you know I think I suspended got back to the school so I'm gonna mess up my whole life here unless I can stop this yeah it's bad my friends and I we just it's fun and so I don't know what to do but I gotta change my morning so it sounds like you're ready you're ready to give this up yeah but maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear right I don't know what I'm going to do I got some friends these guys are they're bad news but they're my friends and it's fun so you know nothing much else going on that's as fun as this doing we still we see these and was working at farm thanks for coming back in I know last time we talked about maybe going out and joining some activities in the community look I'm meeting some people
7590,high_153,counsellor,so then you could tell me about how that's going why didn't do anything yet
7591,high_153,client,I didn't go. I know I was going to go but I didn't. But I did look at there's the YMCA. They've got some classes that I think will be pretty cool to go to. And then there's a yoga class over the Women's Center. It's only like bucks so I could do that. But I can go to really afraid that like worth you know what human likes me more my friends.
7592,high_153,counsellor,yeah I know you've mentioned that in the past when we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities you really mentioned anxiety it's a big column
7593,high_153,client,yeah but I'm gonna do it anyway because this is what I need to do to make to make friends hook up to make a change they have one for sometime
7594,high_153,counsellor,pretty good it's been three months now since you used it's been three months
7595,high_153,client,and I've been doing pretty well and I met a couple new friends -
7596,high_153,counsellor,so how last time we talked to you you were kind of cutting the ex-boyfriend now this is dealer so how's that going
7597,high_153,client,all right it's been good I haven't answered the phone when he's called and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well and I haven't answered the phone so it's been good for me to just reach out like me a couple new people and neighborhoods I'm living in
7598,high_153,counsellor,so sounds like you made some good changes changing your environment and some your behaviors and these new friends
7599,high_153,client,yeah the new friends and I've been using the you know the breathing exercises you taught me when I get starting to feel a little stressed out I've been using those and it helps me I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises and it calms me down and kind of
7600,high_154,client,"Oh actually could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately? Well prior to that party, like as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents are like, they keep me very like, it kept down out of the lake so like social life and I. All about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework, am always studying, that to allow me to go to the party. And um, well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house. So I, that's when I started drinking. It was a unique experience as you could say, I guess you can say. And I don't know, it was fun at least in the moment, so I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my, begged my mom to let me go to another party. And she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to promise her no alcohol, no drugs. Men I'll pick you up by, and I was surprised. Twelve was told us basically when the party starts. But I told her whatever. I thought to myself that I'll come help figure out to delay her call me premium later, so later. So she promised, she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So we go, I have fun like I've been having, and I was drinking. And then the time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up. And as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car, she said you drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor. And I feel terrible because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol."
7601,high_154,counsellor,that's exactly what I did so here you are you're an honor student you're a star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month some time you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence
7602,high_154,client,right like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards school work I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends instead of studying I'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can I get alcohol based on their age
7603,high_154,counsellor,and stuff like that it's really changed your focus
7604,high_154,client,yeah
7605,high_154,counsellor,what do you like about drinking
7606,high_154,client,I don't know it it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part not well not when I'm doing sports but like in like a social environment I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious I would say and when I drink I feel I don't know like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily in our way just so helps you kind of produce to not feel more relaxed exactly
7607,high_154,counsellor,sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe China any other things just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people than hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now a little bit because not all of them are into that
7608,high_154,client,so like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person that's in another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before
7609,high_154,counsellor,okay as they are there for me well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom right where do you think you should kind of go from here
7610,high_154,client,oh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen
7611,high_154,counsellor,mm-hmm
7612,high_154,client,it's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little I guess may seem to other people I created
7613,high_154,counsellor,it it's a big thing your mom is really important to you of course and how she feels about you is important how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit a lot
7614,high_154,client,at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too I feel that there's a feature in that
7615,high_154,counsellor,how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit
7616,high_154,client,I'm pretty confident especially
7617,high_154,counsellor,on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all ten is completely what number
7618,high_154,client,probably like an and I can't be a ton just nothing's a in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to
7619,high_154,counsellor,why'd you say eight or nine rather than six or seven
7620,high_154,client,because I don't know I feel to turn to determine to to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betray my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience that it's not something that I wish to enjoy so I even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking
7621,high_154,counsellor,all right what do you think is a realistic goal for you then
7622,high_154,client,to make sure i have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if i have time i have read your time like oh i'll go party with my friends and just be as I party but that doesn't mean I have to drink and I do cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that
7623,high_154,counsellor,I prefer just make sure your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most. exactly just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though. yeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this. it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there is alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum.
7624,high_154,client,sounds like something that'll work for you and thank you for listening listening to me means a lot to me
7625,high_154,counsellor,yeah it's my pleasure as part of my job as part I like best so I better hurry up and get changed for practice
7626,high_155,client,not bad I guess thanks
7627,high_155,counsellor,Pretty good actually added well let me introduce myself properly. Mines colon I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center. I particularly work with clients or thinking about changing their behavior in some way. But I should address you Bob. What name would you prefer Mr. Jones?
7628,high_155,client,no no I'm I'm Nathan I mean Nate well Nate and my friends call me Nathan so much anything and it is um
7629,high_155,counsellor,so okay like see you're a coach or something like that or
7630,high_155,client,well you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that oh but sure thinking about as a coach bird would help
7631,high_155,counsellor,yeah so I wanted to get started if as a few things we just lay out before we get going yeah so my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and i do want to point out that anything that you say to rise will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly i do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that it sounds as though you rather pin yourself at risk imminent risk are putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that okay is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about
7632,high_155,client,no
7633,high_155,counsellor,I understand it sounds good. I mean I understand so yeah yeah. Well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone Boomer and doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan. But before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you like what brings you here well.
7634,high_155,client,um I've kind of been messing up the last little while and I've kind of got myself into some trouble because because of that to tell me more about well I'm sorry i've ever been nervous sir sure it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this yeah um okay well I've had some job interviews and I've kind of I've missed those and and you know I've really not been too happy with myself the last little while you know I'm kind of getting angry really quickly and and I mean people that I love and like people I normally don't get angry so you know it's it's kind of bothersome
7635,high_155,counsellor,well quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting irritable we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities so some work opportunities
7636,high_155,client,well yeah um yeah because I've been kind of partying hard and well honey my wife gets upset about that and Dicky
7637,high_155,counsellor,so could you tell me more you've been partying your wife's being an upset with you well going on
7638,high_155,client,well the thing is okay so I'm I don't have a job I'm unemployed and you know I've got some free time on my hands and I'll be honest with you I've been kind of a little bit down because that and I thought you know my friends been trying to get my spirits up and so you know we've been out partying and drinking and stuff like that but that's not been the only problem that's the thing well I mean you know drinking's been a problem I've been drinking too much
7639,high_155,counsellor,so you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much
7640,high_155,client,yeah but but that's not the only thing I mean I'll be honest with you i've been i've been doing cocaine as well and and then you know of course that leads to more drinking and and you know more cocaine so I'm I'm just trying to think of you know maybe I should cut back on the coke and kind back on the cold
7641,high_155,counsellor,well you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not a bit missing job opportunities you've talked about and be getting irritable and the noticing you had been different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more part in a bit more and also using some cocaine I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today athan what would be good for you to talk about now
7642,high_155,client,well I mean well yeah that's that's about it but I guess it'd be kind of like trying to get the the coke situation a bit under control and because it's getting out of control out of control yeah I know some people that are worse than me but thinking of it worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold hard things um I guess the worst thing is that you know I've been doing the coke in and
7643,high_155,counsellor,well okay
7644,high_155,client,I'll tell you about this one situation that it's kind of scared me a little bit is that you know I've done some coke and some booze and like lots of it and I remember this one time I was in the car in the back seat and the driver done kind of the same thing you made then some coke and some booze and and it was is is pretty scary and you know and I was really really high and he was really high and we were driving and it kind of just hit me and it was scary so so good sliding is very scary yeah well I mean I'll be honest with you there's there's been other times that you know I've kind of woken up the next day and I don't even know where I was I mean and I don't even remember so it's not remembering it I must be scary to it to not remember things yeah I guess not remembering is has been that's definitely scary and then you know being in situations where it's been really dangerous sometimes it gets foggy and you know yes this is going to sound kind of silly but you know sometimes the only way I can find out what I've actually done is by going to my facebook and then finding out because other people have been talking about it or I've seen pictures and stuff like that and that kind of jogs my memory and then when I start to see those things I kind of wish I hadn't done them
7645,high_155,counsellor,so so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested it from Europe for your copious so you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you
7646,high_155,client,yeah and you know I guess because I've been putting other people at risk too and I you know I love I love my wife and and and I love my family and I and my friends and I want to do something that's it's right you know that I'm really going to regret
7647,high_155,counsellor,your family your wife your friends are all really important to you
7648,high_155,client,very very important
7649,high_155,counsellor,thinking about importance Nathan how important it be for you to make changes to your core cues
7650,high_155,client,well I mean eight I don't know it you know eight out of ten if that's you know that makes a lot of sense
7651,high_155,counsellor,yeah it's good to use imaginary scales absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and deal with people yeah okay yeah so you're roughly eight
7652,high_155,client,yeah
7653,high_155,counsellor,I mean it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let see a four
7654,high_155,client,well I guess because it's been big causing me problems and you know I've missed some job interviews and and I don't even know you know kind of what I've done you know until the next day or you know You Know Who I am I you know I've kind of been been hurt you know by my friends and stuff like that and and you know in influence I guess in a bad way from from them and you know and then of course then you know I've been having problems you know sleeping and stuff like that and you know not getting sleep and sleeping properly and you know and then all of that kind of falls back and it's upsetting my family and
7655,high_155,counsellor,so sorry it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you to to think about changing
7656,high_155,client,yeah yeah I mean one of the reasons why I come here is I'm thinking because the cocaine in my mind the cocaine is the issue
7657,high_155,counsellor,mm-hmm
7658,high_155,client,and I'm because it's a vicious cycle with the cocaine and drinking and I'm hoping that maybe if I can somehow you'll resolve that then maybe maybe like I won't be drinking as much like I'm okay I'm not an alcoholic I mean and you know just it's it's a problem with the cocaine
7659,high_155,counsellor,so and certainly our labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what what what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work
7660,high_155,client,I'll be honest with you. I don't know much. I mean I've read a few minor things on the internet. But I mean I get confused about that.
7661,high_155,counsellor,and I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it Wow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that it's surprising well you know see the thing is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and wow what else do you make of it
7662,high_155,client,well I guess it means that I really need to stop one of them and ain't gonna be the beer
7663,high_155,counsellor,I guess so for you if you were to stop one it'd be the cocaine. It's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine makes like you say they doing and all that. So thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to? You told me earlier was very important to you.
7664,high_155,client,but I was
7665,high_155,counsellor,how confident you are and I may be again in an imaginary scale of to where is the most confident one is the least confident
7666,high_155,client,well I mean I'll be honest yeah I'm not that confident about it I'm I don't know on a scale of one to ten maybe maybe five four are like yeah for
7667,high_155,counsellor,so there's somewhat competent then I wonder whites for and let's see no a one
7668,high_155,client,I sure I could stop I mean it's just that you know there'd be a lot of temptations you know when I go with my friends I mean a lot of my friends use but I guess
7669,high_155,counsellor,so a lot of your your friends use and it could be quite tempt and you're sure you could stop
7670,high_155,client,well yeah I think so I mean I mean I could tell them
7671,high_155,counsellor,I suppose there are some things you could do to help yourself stop then
7672,high_155,client,yeah I guess so I mean I can avoid certain bars where I know it's easily available and
7673,high_155,counsellor,these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I Anna certainly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to stop I'm i did mention earlier that i had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us two million if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions how would that feel for you that work
7674,high_155,client,okay
7675,high_155,counsellor,yeah that's okay yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly become concerned about your recent years as you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some finished off at risks and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which i guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you
7676,low_001,counsellor,hi Laura so thanks for coming in I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about so basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester and we're gonna talk about you know whatever's kind of going on in your life I'll ask you some questions about you know your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know different behaviors and and stuff like that and so it's it's pretty casual pretty informal just sort of a chance for me to get to know you
7677,low_001,client,alright
7678,low_001,counsellor,okay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself
7679,low_001,client,okay um my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school
7680,low_001,counsellor,okay and what do you like to do for fun
7681,low_001,client,mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends things like that
7682,low_001,counsellor,and when you and your friends are hanging out and what do you do go to ball games go to party
7683,low_001,client,if it's school related maybe like a game or two or go to the mall like to shop or go to the movies or something and that night maybe like a party or something someone's throwing
7684,low_001,counsellor,okay and what kind of hobbies do you have
7685,low_001,client,um I like to be and I like to go outside and like take walks and like hike and stuff I'm very outdoorsy so oh cool
7686,low_001,counsellor,what are your plans for after high school
7687,low_001,client,well I plan to apply to college and maybe you know have a good career and something like that hopefully
7688,low_001,counsellor,that's great what do you think you'll study
7689,low_001,client,well I'm I'm looking at the journalism maybe pre-law
7690,low_001,counsellor,Oh neat
7691,low_001,client,which is a little different but
7692,low_001,counsellor,yeah that's great that's a really good goal
7693,low_001,client,yeah thanks
7694,low_001,counsellor,it's a hard work to get into law school are you doing school what kind of grades do you get
7695,low_001,client,I'm doing okay I'm getting mostly A's and B's so we're pretty good okay
7696,low_001,counsellor,okay what classes are you not getting A's and B's in
7697,low_001,client,um I think all my grades raisin B's
7698,low_001,counsellor,oh
7699,low_001,client,yeah
7700,low_001,counsellor,okay and do you know where you're going to apply to college
7701,low_001,client,I'm not sure yet but I'm looking into schools if like in the area so maybe I don't know maybe I only poem or something
7702,low_001,counsellor,okay cool and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism
7703,low_001,client,um well I'm definitely not a math or science person so I started off by there that I start looking at careers that maybe I would like so
7704,low_001,counsellor,okay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties so do you drink alcohol
7705,low_001,client,um not really maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most
7706,low_001,counsellor,okay and how often do you think you drink
7707,low_001,client,um maybe like once or twice a month at the most
7708,low_001,counsellor,mm-hmm so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol
7709,low_001,client,yeah
7710,low_001,counsellor,okay and so that's maybe like 20 times a year
7711,low_001,client,possibly yeah
7712,low_001,counsellor,so that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then
7713,low_001,client,yeah I guess you can say that
7714,low_001,counsellor,okay what do you think's the most you've ever had
7715,low_001,client,um just two drinks at a party at the most I don't I don't like to drink a lot I don't getting drunk is not something that appeals to me so I just have like a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking I just like to look like I'm actually doing something most a lot of time I don't even drink at all so
7716,low_001,counsellor,but you've been drunk before
7717,low_001,client,um no not really maybe tipsy but not like drunk
7718,low_001,counsellor,okay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day
7719,low_001,client,yeah
7720,low_001,counsellor,okay interesting so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol
7721,low_001,client,um yeah yeah
7722,low_001,counsellor,okay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing all right have you ever done that have you ever done
7723,low_001,client,never drunk driven and I've never got in the car with a drunk driver
7724,low_001,counsellor,okay how much do your friends drink
7725,low_001,client,um I mean I have some friends that drink someone others like my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that but I know that there are people that
7726,low_001,counsellor,okay
7727,low_001,client,drink a lot more
7728,low_001,counsellor,what about at these parties you're going to there are other kids there who are drinking a lot
7729,low_001,client,yeah there are kids that drink a lot more than I do definitely you
7730,low_001,counsellor,and do you hang out with them
7731,low_001,client,not really closely like I know who they are and I'll say hi but not they're not really that close friends of mine
7732,low_001,counsellor,mm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk did you know that
7733,low_001,client,um yeah that make sense
7734,low_001,counsellor,yeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accidents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted
7735,low_001,client,yeah
7736,low_001,counsellor,you know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about that
7737,low_001,client,yeah yeah I have that's one of the main reasons I don't like to drink that much so
7738,low_001,counsellor,and then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that
7739,low_001,client,yeah definitely
7740,low_001,counsellor,but you're still drinking
7741,low_001,client,yeah I mean I guess it's the thing to do at a party so
7742,low_001,counsellor,so I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney
7743,low_001,client,um definitely not that's why I don't try to drink that much just make it look like I kind of
7744,low_001,counsellor,okay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer
7745,low_001,client,okay
7746,low_001,counsellor,um obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that
7747,low_001,client,I definitely agree I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol other than the ones you mentioned like health-wise and things like that so I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing
7748,low_001,counsellor,so do you think you can quit
7749,low_001,client,um yeah I mean it's not like a really big part of my life so
7750,low_001,counsellor,okay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit
7751,low_001,client,okay
7752,low_001,counsellor,and that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision um so I guess can you quit this weekend then
7753,low_001,client,yeah yeah definitely I'll just not have a drink
7754,low_001,counsellor,okay and then what about your friends who are still drinking
7755,low_001,client,um I really can't control what they do but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will
7756,low_001,counsellor,okay and what if they won't
7757,low_001,client,well then I guess I'll just try to hang around unless or something or try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party anything
7758,low_001,counsellor,yeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should just find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence
7759,low_001,client,okay yeah
7760,low_001,counsellor,and then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol
7761,low_001,client,okay yeah definitely
7762,low_001,counsellor,okay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking
7763,low_001,client,they would be pretty upset yeah they don't really condone alcohol use oh
7764,low_001,counsellor,okay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then um okay yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here
7765,low_001,client,no I think I'm good

7920,low_010,client,okay sure should have some time
7921,low_010,counsellor,okay well this should only take a few minutes so before we get started I just want to make sure I still got all the correct information so you're still on Emma Street with the same phone number and everything right
7922,low_010,client,yep
7923,low_010,counsellor,okay so nothing's changed wonderful um now I was taking a look at your medication profile earlier and it looks like you're on two different strengths of lipitor so that obviously can't be right
7924,low_010,client,yeah I don't think no I don't think that's what I do
7925,low_010,counsellor,okay so do you remember which one you're taking
7926,low_010,client,I don't know
7927,low_010,counsellor,you don't know okay I think you're taking the 10 milligram tablets it's not right
7928,low_010,client,that sounds right and I remember the doctor was telling me that now that's that's what I'm doing now I'm pretty sure
7929,low_010,counsellor,okay okay so the doctor gave you this new prescription but there's new medication is that right
7930,low_010,client,I think so
7931,low_010,counsellor,okay okay so this medication is for your cholesterol
7932,low_010,client,okay
7933,low_010,counsellor,and you're going to take it once a day it's really important that you take it every day all right and you can take it with or without food it doesn't really matter yes once a day
7934,low_010,client,okay okay
7935,low_010,counsellor,okay and now the doctor did tell you this was your cholesterol right C yeah he said that's why I checked my blood last time that's why I was in for a visit right right exactly so that's why he wrote you this prescription so it's greater cholesterol you're just gonna take it once a day it's really easy C okay there are some side effects that go along with this medication but I wouldn't really worry about it because I mean you're young you're healthy it's not an issue so don't concern yourself with it okay all right so just to make sure that I didn't miss anything I'm just gonna repeat everything again to make sure you got it first time
7936,low_010,client,okay
7937,low_010,counsellor,all right so this medication is for your cholesterol you're gonna take it once a day you can take it with a lot of water and you want to make sure you don't miss any doses okay
7938,low_010,client,okay
7939,low_010,counsellor,okay what questions do you have any questions at all

7947,low_011,client,gonna get that again
7948,low_011,counsellor,coffee tea yeah you've heard this before I'm sure
7949,low_011,client,I do all of the above yeah
7950,low_011,counsellor,mm-hmm so you know the smoking is gonna be related not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically it affects dental caries dental cavities

7958,low_011,counsellor,yes and I really want to be helpful I really want to you know my commitment is to your oral health so there are lots of medications out there David that actually take away a lot of the cravings there they make quitting subtle things
7959,low_011,client,I did try it like I did try it I just did the pills and they didn't work
7960,low_011,counsellor,yeah
7961,low_011,client,it was a waste and it caused more side-effects
7962,low_011,counsellor,No it but David it's not a waste research shows that people take on average about 7 tries before they quit smoking so think of it as your one step closer to quitting
7963,low_011,client,or seven lectures along the road
7964,low_011,counsellor,well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture is really not what I meant
7965,low_011,client,I know I just feel that way. I get really I get very defensive about when they bring it because I get it from my family dog my cardiologist everybody. I'm just like I'm not a complete fool. I am for smoking.
7966,low_011,counsellor,well there's there's a reason that people are concerned
7967,low_011,client,But it's not easy to quit
7968,low_011,counsellor,no but as I said these medications so you've tried the medication you've been willing once
7969,low_011,client,Yea
7970,low_011,counsellor,then can I write you a prescription for the medication can we talk about how you could use it because this is something that that's very important not just for your overall physical health even your oral health
7971,low_011,client,yes I got I really want doing things I've tried usually cause me more problems and they helped
7972,low_011,counsellor,oh no the smoking is gonna cause you more problems than the than anything else I can promise you that David the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking
7973,low_011,client,hmm
7974,low_011,counsellor,like that's the I think thing to really consider
7975,low_011,client,okay well can I go now

8007,low_013,counsellor,all right then okay well let's let's just have a look shall we see what's going on you just fine open your mouth for me so ah
8008,low_013,client,ah
8009,low_013,counsellor,okay right see if your honesty I'm looking there it just looks like one of those viruses that going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats so I think that we should just go for a bit of paracetamol and some fluids and snail it nature sort it out
8010,low_013,client,I've been saying for half an hour do you not want to know a little bit more about to so I mean it's really painful I've barely been able to swallow today I'm still worried about passing things on to the kids
8011,low_013,counsellor,well I mean I'm sorry we're a bit late but you know that's general practice isn't it you know sometimes these things happen but there's also the fact that you do just have a virus and they are very common and the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids and the process will help with giving it to the kids I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that it's unlikely they'll get it but I'm going to it
8012,low_013,client,well I mean it's going to affect my job I talked on the phone quite a lot of work and I'm just I don't think at the moment I'm going to be able to go to work and can I at least get a sick note
8013,low_013,counsellor,all right well well not really you need to self-certifying you for seven days off six it's going to take some time off just take some paracetamol lots of fluids get a self-certified note and it in to your employer and put sauce right there
8014,low_013,client,"I don't think my employee are going to take that. I mean that they've given us so much. Has some things in the past. Anika, can I get a private? No, can I ask you to write me a letter at least?"
8015,low_013,counsellor,oh well obviously that's a non NHS thing so we have to charge you for that going rate that is 12 pounds
8016,low_013,client,it's just not good enough I just I'm sorry but you know if you have just got a sore throat and there's not much I can do about that it's just you know something that we all get from time to time perhaps what you really need to do is you know just take some paracetamol and get some fluids
8017,low_013,counsellor,how does the paracetamol do you understand how difficult this is going to be for me I mean I could lose my job or something okay
8018,low_013,client,that's pretty good like the software I think that's so yeah a little bit of grunt staging though I'm sorry I think I'm gonna say something that I don't I don't want to so much to go to go
8019,low_013,counsellor,okay
8020,low_013,client,thank you
8021,low_014,counsellor,why miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme doctor still hasn't told you about your drinking
8022,low_014,client,okay
8023,low_014,counsellor,he said that you filled out the form and that you came to him for some medication for your stress but they're really concerned about your alcohol consumption before I made you any made any prescriptions for you so let me see that form please
8024,low_014,client,okay
8025,low_014,counsellor,thanks yeah well it says here that you drink four more times a week and that you have for one or two drinks and that you go over that limit on a fairly regular basis that's too much that's too much I mean I imagine that he's already told you that he can't prescribe you anything unless you do something about his drinking
8026,low_014,client,okay I I'm really confused I he did want me to come and talk to you I'm just not real thrilled with the way this is going
8027,low_014,counsellor,well I'm sure you're not because anybody that the drinks of these levels isn't going to throw talking about her drinking with a professional like myself what we know is that if you if you continue to drink at this rate you're probably going to wind up drinking more and more and imagine as he's concerned as you can order to me now
8028,low_014,client,I think I was drinking that much I mean a you know one or two glasses of
8029,low_014,counsellor,happy this is a glass I mean this is a typical glass which is five ounces of wine but but what I know is that most people doing a lot more of that so
8030,low_014,client,what
8031,low_014,counsellor,I'm pretty sure that your glass is recent bigger than our wouldn't you say
8032,low_014,client,you don't Mir not in my household you don't know what idea it is about that size maybe maybe
8033,low_014,counsellor,I don't I've been in the house where they have these stem glasses that's only a restaurant most people have tumblers so imagine that's why I find about good your cupboards and well anyway so what he said was that you came to him for some kind of benzodiazepine something for anxiety and we can't prescribe anything like that much if you're drinking of these levels so we need you to stop or at least cut back to reasonable levels which for you would be number three drinks in one setting which you're drinking over that now or no more than seven drinks among which you are well over right now so if you can agree to that and then perhaps you can make that prescription for I can't promise that either but but that's certainly one thing the other thing you need to do is to read this take this pamphlet and read it and you'll see in there that it tells you about limits of alcohol I think you'll find that if you if you can stick to there you should be okay you may be able to prescribe the medication Empire not shortcut promise but if you do have problems and I'm suspect you may have problems coming back to those levels then we can make a referral for you to counselor to come and talk about your increased drinking so any questions for me and
8034,low_014,client,no no questions at all
8035,low_014,counsellor,all right well thanks and I'll talk dr. Zeile you came in and you were reasonably compliant and that you said you'd follow through

8138,low_017,counsellor,deal with it you pussy
8139,low_017,client,hmm
8140,low_017,counsellor,what am I supposed to do with this
8141,low_017,client,whatever your little heart desires
8142,low_017,counsellor,I've had enough you're sick take that friction I'm attending my money I don't even want it's the waste of my time there's something wrong with you you need serious help you need to go to a doctor you should not be treating other people
8143,low_017,client,come on come on run goodbye you want some cocaine I got some cocaine who wants him go here
8144,low_017,counsellor,you're sick man tall
8145,low_017,client,Amber hi this is Dr. Weiner calling confirming next week's appointment. I had a great session with you and I really hope to hear from you soon. Just give me a call back let me know what your schedule is like. Alright thank you very much goodbye.
8146,low_017,counsellor,holy crap
8147,low_018,counsellor,okay how can I help you see well I would just confirm for me your name again Oh like yes yes I brought you Reducto. Reducto actually is no longer recommended and for usin in we lost weight control. Have you been getting on with it?
8148,low_018,client,no not losing weight but I'm not putting it on and just give me another one there I'm not too fussy about which one it is
8149,low_018,counsellor,me you can buy em over the counter Laura doors lower doors tablets II don't need a prescription for them anymore
8150,low_018,client,no I'm sorry we can't prescribe orlistat
8151,low_018,counsellor,why
8152,low_018,client,and because it's over-the-counter medicines right so just give me the equivalent that you prescribe
8153,low_018,counsellor,we can't we can't prescribe anything reducta was the the one that was was prescription on the medicine and we can no longer prescribe that guidance recommends that we no longer prescribe that for people because it's actually shown to increase the cardiovascular risk actually I noticed from your last visit that your blood pressure was a little bit high I don't think you should be taking any medicines because the bottom line is actually from what you're telling me is it's not helping you to lose weight it's helping you to maintain your weight and maintaining your weight should be something that you do through diet and exercise anyway this is artificially maintaining your weight well it has actually been recent guidance over the last month or so 9 to 6 weeks tips sometimes tears I bet to filter through but we've been told unequivocally that we're not allowed to prescribe this anymore when you take your prescription to clap pharmacist they won't fill it you really do need to be joining Weight Watchers there's been an article there's been an article in the in the BMG just a couple of weeks ago that shows that actually joining and group a Weight Watchers group or the equivalent it's much more effective long term well I'm sorry there's no choice it's a much it's much more because it's less there's less and drug in it it's less effective but then consequently it's also less dangerous so you can buy them or less stop and or you can join wheight Watchers I know I know and I can appreciate that but it's your diet and exercise that's the important thing you need to get yourself softer down well I think you might find that you possibly are eating more than you think if you joined Weight Watchers or equivalent slimming world etc then you possibly would be encouraged to do a food diet you might find that you're eating more than you there's nothing more I can do for you we cannot prescribe Reducto anymore the recommendation is join a Weight Watchers group or Slimming World Group and just modify your diet and increase your exercise that is the only way that you are going to lose weight I'm really sorry that I'm unable to because there must be well that is the recommendation that's the guidelines if you're very welcome to go and make an appointment with another doctor but you will get the same message from them as you're getting from me I'm sorry if I appeared on some pathetic however the bottom line is diet and exercise is what you need to do in order to lose weight and to maintain your weight
8154,low_018,client,just know that I'm getting middle-aged and piling on the pounds so if you're
8155,low_018,counsellor,if you're doing what you've always done then you're always going to get what you get so if you already eat and you've all been back but the only reason that you're maintaining your weight is because of the deductr
8156,low_018,client,if you would let me finish I've only started to get fat so are you telling me that because I've had the menopause I'm not allowed to eat a normal amount of food
8157,low_018,counsellor,no I'm saying that you need to be looking at your whole lifestyle which is diet and exercise I'm really sorry that I'm unable to help you today please feel free to make an appointment with another GP
8158,low_018,client,i think i will i'm not satisfied
8159,low_019,counsellor,okay help you
8160,low_019,client,oh yeah I just got off work and apparently they're going smoke-free so I'm I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and they say they don't work very well I really want to quit smoking I just need somebody to get me through the day
8161,low_019,counsellor,so you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking maybe like that during the day nicotine replacement is that I mean
8162,low_019,client,do you all have anything like that
8163,low_019,counsellor,we don't really recommend that the ideas you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either
8164,low_019,client,well I don't really want to quit I mean I like smoking I'll go like after work to have a beer with my friends not smoke cigarettes I mean it's not really a big deal cigarettes aren't that bad I mean I know that the it's popular to say that smoking is bad for you but you know I like it so I'm gonna keep doing it okay
8165,low_019,counsellor,well smoking really is really bad for you you know it causes things like lung cancer emphysema heart disease
8166,low_019,client,yeah okay oh well what are my options you know I assuming that I'm right what are my options
8167,low_019,counsellor,well to be honest with you you mentioned the patch I can't recommend a patch to you if you're going to continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you in order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now
8168,low_019,client,I mean I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean I probably smoke about five or six years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes. But it's sort of hard to get through the day work.
8169,low_019,counsellor,okay well we actually considered 20 cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement
8170,low_019,client,sounds good to me the more nicotine and the better is there like gum or something I could chew it like while I'm in the office that sounds pretty great I mean do you have
8171,low_019,counsellor,there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings and probably the gum would be the best option for you it's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however the gum is something you use just when you have a craving
8172,low_019,client,oh okay well where's that
8173,low_019,counsellor,well we have that here but again the the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking
8174,low_019,client,well I'm probably not gonna buy anything today I just came by to see what my options are I think thanks for the input I mean do you have anything else any other advice for me
8175,low_019,counsellor,"Aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge. That would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd want to use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement. But again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke."
8176,low_019,client,oh okay well thanks I mean I guess that helps a little bit oh maybe I'll be back later thanks
8177,low_019,counsellor,okay
8178,low_020,counsellor,Hey okay
8179,low_020,client,knock knock

8285,low_021,client,I started fighting and I was in the room and I didn't know what to do so I wanted to leave to get the supervisor that who they both deal with but I couldn't leave them in the room are you in because I did know what what would happen so
8286,low_021,counsellor,so you just start doing what to say to them did you just say you've got to stop arguing why didn't you say just stop arguing

8296,low_021,counsellor,okay um which part
8297,low_021,client,well I don't think that that's right for me to get up and tell someone to stop it when are you feeling quite vulnerable and fragile in this situation and it was a very difficult situation
8298,low_021,counsellor,so telling me you would have got a going to get somebody else to come back
8299,low_021,client,well they were my clients and they asked me to sit in the room with them well until I came back so I was waiting for them to come back anyway but then they started hiding and I couldn't do anything about it so I was waiting for him
8300,low_021,counsellor,to be fired for tendance know about him
8301,low_021,client,but I didn't know that no one told me to thank it allows me to sit in the room

8305,low_021,client,all right
8306,low_021,counsellor,you know you thought about the process
8307,low_021,client,well I haven't thought about the process that's what I was wanting to bring it to supervision to talk to you about
8308,low_021,counsellor,okay
8309,low_021,client,to see what I could have done
8310,low_021,counsellor,yeah yeah well we kind of times up and I have got so much work to look can you help me this afternoon I've just got some case notes that I really need done I need only I've got a heap of families that they bring up I'm just not going to get to and I've been going to leave at 3:00 because I've got to go and see a friend who's in hospital so can you help me out with them
8311,low_021,client,well
8312,low_021,counsellor,oh come on you can do that
8313,low_021,client,I'm kind of in it's going to some meetings this afternoon
8314,low_021,counsellor,for what
8315,low_021,client,little meetings with some clients because they've finally given me a contact
8316,low_021,counsellor,say my name is Sally she'll do them you can come with makers I really like some help with some Agnew and hunger off you
8317,low_022,counsellor,"All right Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. And as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. And I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about a party this weekend. And from what I hear, you were there. And you know I can't confirm or deny anything, so I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how you know you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams."
8318,low_022,client,all right actually I do want to speak to you about something to happen during this past weekend usually as you know I'm I'm gonna honor student I usually I'm studying over the weekend my parents to let me go out to parties but I kind of used that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to and when I when I got there like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason because I was there in the moment I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else was doing so I wouldn't beat him I wouldn't be ostracized
8319,low_022,counsellor,yeah I get it like we've all been there okay you know I was in high school once - you know I drank - I get it there's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but you know promise we have these rules and you're on a team you have to stick by the rules
8320,low_022,client,um I know that it's bad for me it's bad for my body it's bad for for for for being on the team for being an athlete it hinders my performance just I don't know I feel like my friends pressure me I don't know if I should like go with different fine groups maybe I don't know
8321,low_022,counsellor,yeah Chris come on you're getting peer pressure
8322,low_022,client,I don't know like being in a sports team you feel very you have to like be unified with the group
8323,low_022,counsellor,yeah well you're one of the leaders
8324,low_022,client,right and as being one of the leaders but my fellow teammates expect me to be excited expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments and if that's social a social social custom in our society so
8325,low_022,counsellor,maybe Panther leading as a non-drinker then I could but that could also backfire on me I feel that I could be ridiculed for being I mean stake up my butt you know
8326,low_022,client,you're a star player who's gonna pick on you
8327,low_022,counsellor,I mean it's just one I'm just one person it's the
8328,low_022,client,all right well this is the mouth
8329,low_022,counsellor,yeah so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking I can't be hearing that you're at parties you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook you know there there are rules at this school and in my job I have to enforce them so you know like I said I get it you know I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun you're teenagers I get that but you know you are a star player we want to keep you on the team you know we got to figure out a way to get through this
8330,low_022,client,well I'll dedicate the time not to party and like no not-not-not party but you get involved with alcohol to that extent and like have it publicized on the Internet
8331,low_022,counsellor,what do you mean
8332,low_022,client,like on Facebook all the pictures that you saw him internet like I will avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so others can see even though
8333,low_022,counsellor,all right yeah I mean we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team okay
8334,low_022,client,right oh stop
8335,low_022,counsellor,all right you promise all right shake all right we'll see you later
8336,low_023,counsellor,come in
8337,low_023,client,hello how are you today
8338,low_023,counsellor,I'm very well thank you I just need money repeat prescription and whatsapp for the road doctor
8339,low_023,client,you're ductile
8340,low_023,counsellor,and that's
8341,low_023,client,all right know what when was the last time you got that prescription from us yes I'm surprised did you see the local GP hmm you shouldn't have been given the doctor why do you think you need that no no no you can't you you can't get that drug anymore I'm afraid no no you're not having that trap anymore and it's been proven that that drug is not good for you and so I'm very surprised that the look and gave it to you but we're not doing it anymore yes but it's not it's not fine it's not good for your heart it's causing heart problems and it's been proven that it's not the most effective way to lose weight and what what are you doing about your lifestyle what are you doing about losing weight other than depending on tablets really that's doing a bit more stairs well it's gonna take a bit more than that I think and have you thought about planning in advance if you work you know taking a packed lunch pre-planning your meals and turning to healthy options because really even diet cooks not good for you you should be replacing that with water yeah but I roll the other doctors over wait you know so clearly you could be improving your lifestyle you could take a rap and just have it you know you could make her rap a healthy rap and take it and just have it instead of reaching for a bar of chocolate because that'll also affect your blood pressure and your sugar levels so what I think he should maybe do is maybe just have a maybe do a diary of your lifestyle because well it's I know popping a pill seems like an easy option but really you're gonna have to do the hard work this is only going to come if you get in the right headspace and you start looking at your lifestyle looking at your exercise looking at your eating habits looking at the frequency and your might that you're eating because if you're running about as a doctor you shouldn't beginning we if you if you've got a busy lifestyle you should be losing weight naturally so you there must be something in your daily routine that's stopping you so you maybe need to look and see if you're a comfort eater or what what your triggers are for food and and get that sorted but you know I'm afraid drugs are no longer the answer no I know I you know we would all like a magic wand because it makes life easier but I can't do that it's not worth the risk to your heart I can't I can't do that you just need to take a long hard look at yourself and what you're doing and if you want help with that we do have pamphlets you know have you thought about and you know doing some exercise that would make you feel more energized
8342,low_023,counsellor,no lack of energy bear on your little day that's not a problem it's just really time to do something else it's just work asleep yeah
8343,low_023,client,so you need to put some thought into if you if that is your lifestyle you're going to have to put some thought into when you can devote some time to looking after yourself so are you putting on weight or have you been loosing the weight
8344,low_023,counsellor,let's think you can be steady
8345,low_023,client,so you've not you've not been losing weight with it
8346,low_023,counsellor,that's been okay
8347,low_023,client,so you can't you know it's it's good that you're standing still but it's not good that you're not losing weight especially if you're on the drugs so clearly the drug wasn't the answer for you and really the only answer for you as is lifestyle changes and you know look at your colleagues and are they what are they eating and adopt some of their policies in was their eating on the hoof they must there must be some of your colleagues that are eating healthy options that you could you could take a flask of soup you know soups salads wraps fruit and veg you know that's that's the only way it's the hard way but it's that's why I think you need to control of it yourself by planning and making sure that you have healthy options available because otherwise you're just going to stay in a vicious cycle and you know drugs we would all like a drug to me things easy for us but I'm afraid it's not the option it's going to be a hard slog but I think I think you'll find that once you start if you get yourself into the right headspace once you start then you will have a sense of achievement and the wheat will start loose you will start losing the weak because if you're that energetic in your job you're obviously doing enough activity so it has to be down to the diet well why don't you make a diary of everything that you eat because you might not realize I had you might be grazing and not realizing it so why don't you keep a food diary and come back and see me and two weeks time can you keep a diet have you got cake keep a diary for two weeks if you if you write down everything that you eat and any extra activity other than running a boat in your jobs that you do and we'll look at that and we're you know before you go and will we when you come back and then we'll see if you can start making a conscious effort and then we'll maybe sit you down with a dietician set you up with an appointment with the dietician to get some nutritional advice but I think you need to start preparing yourself mentally and to be in the right headspace to make this work for you because if you're not in the right frame of mind if you're doing it grudgingly then you're not going to lose weight okay thank you you you
8348,low_024,counsellor,okay finish the exam have some good news and they have some not-so-good news looks like you don't have any cavities so that's the good news
8349,low_024,client,that's great
8350,low_024,counsellor,however I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth actually if you look up here a roof of your mouth I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user so I'm just wondering what's going on
8351,low_024,client,I don't smoke cigarettes
8352,low_024,counsellor,okay well as I said there's a lot of irritation in particular like I was mentioning up here in the roof of your mouth it's turned really deathly white colored and there's little red spots and you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health it's called nicotinic stomatitis and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco so maybe you're not smoking cigarettes are you smoking a pipe or cigars or is there something else they will be contributing to this because I don't know what else might be causing it
8353,low_024,client,well the only thing I've never smoked cigarettes ever but when when I go out with my friends we like to go to you know we'd like to go out to lounges and and you know sometimes there are those those nice young men that gift you different sorts of things and we got some of those mini cigars that swisher Sweets they come on peach and and grape and and you know that's the only time that really you know I've ever really used anything that that's got to pack Oh in it
8354,low_024,counsellor,okay so I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruit flavored people think they're okay those are really bad for you did you know that
8355,low_024,client,I'm really bad but they're just little mini little cute little girly cigars
8356,low_024,counsellor,right there still cigars and there's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer oral cancer emphysema all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes
8357,low_024,client,boy only if it were just to relax I mean it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day I mean I only do it when we go out
8358,low_024,counsellor,uh-huh well that's I mean at least you're not doing that so that's good but it's still causing a lot of problems and as I said I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth you're causing some serious damage and this needs to stop have you thought about quitting
8359,low_024,client,well I didn't really know I'd started
8360,low_024,counsellor,what do you mean
8361,low_024,client,I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking. Just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.
8362,low_024,counsellor,so you're going to quit then
8363,low_024,client,oh maybe
8364,low_024,counsellor,what do you mean maybe I just told you how bad it is for you it's messing up your mouth you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases this is really important you need to quit
8365,low_024,client,well it's something that I'll have to think about
8366,low_024,counsellor,what's there to think about you said it's not that something you do all that often I'm there's all these negative side effects there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in
8367,low_024,client,well it's just something that I do to relax and I don't with that often and so I probably could cut back
8368,low_024,counsellor,okay well that's a good start but cutting back isn't going to do it if you actually quit the smoking you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth and you can stop yourself from from being at risk for these other diseases but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger
8369,low_024,client,well I don't believe that their cigars and what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right and it's something that I choose to do and so I will think about cutting back but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that and I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real
8370,low_024,counsellor,you're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually it can cause problems with your teeth too I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before that's another side effect there are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use whether it's cigarettes cigars dip to snuff snooze hukkah any of it this is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die
8371,low_024,client,well it's something that I'll think about
8372,low_024,counsellor,well I appreciate you thinking about I hope you'll think about it really hard you know this is something that I'm going to continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change
8373,low_025,counsellor,so Tommy I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know you're such a good kid like I don't know what you're doing drinking it's gonna ruin your life
8374,low_025,client,I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn't like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I ate all my friends were doing it and it was just it's it's not something that I like do it Kate on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes
8375,low_025,counsellor,"Tommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know. You're not even 21 yet. You could get arrested. You could, you know, have a drunk driving accident. You could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really, really concerns me."
8376,low_025,client,right I get what you're coming from but I I really did I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone I didn't want to be you know how do I put this like I wanted to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends were okay so I didn't let myself drink too much
8377,low_025,counsellor,there's really no such thing as not drinking too much I mean anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much you know like think about it think about all the things that can happen to you yeah I understand exactly what you're saying and
8378,low_025,client,how much are you drinking I don't think I'm drinking that much I mean it's it's mainly for social gatherings like it's nothing that I do like by myself or whatever it's just that either
8379,low_025,counsellor,like every weekend
8380,low_025,client,every other weekend I would say
8381,low_025,counsellor,Tommy I'm just so concerned you know can't you think of anything better to do
8382,low_025,client,I guess I can I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much I do get where you're coming from and is
8383,low_025,counsellor,are your friends the problem like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with
8384,low_025,client,yeah I guess I haven't really put it on myself I guess it's really been forced on their account and I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun and I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can
8385,low_025,counsellor,well there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice right that's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you and I just you know I really think you should think about making a big change here
8386,low_025,client,yeah I I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I it does make a lot of sense and I I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level drinking
8387,low_025,counsellor,I think you really need to quit
8388,low_025,client,yeah I mean alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life
8389,low_025,counsellor,I think you're wrong you know it really worries me anyway I wish you would quit if all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing you know I appreciate you talking to me about this but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it it's really important
8390,low_025,client,yeah I I just I don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but um do you want to wait for that to happen do you want to wait for a dramatic experience
8391,low_025,counsellor,yeah you're right I don't want I don't want to be too far gone before it's too late like I I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape and I I guess I've never really had any any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much so I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of but in reality I might not have as much control as I think
8392,low_025,client,all right well maybe it's something we can work on together and you know I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking
8393,low_025,counsellor,yeah I think that that would be a good step forward into an a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol
8394,low_025,client,okay sounds good
8395,low_026,client,and his wife has told him that if he doesn't quit drinking she's gonna leave and so he's totally the expert helping with this issue and so
8396,low_026,counsellor,supposedly is exactly the word supposedly is the key word yes okay
8397,low_026,client,so we're talking with maybe 5% or Oh net or gross five percent gross
8398,low_026,counsellor,let's see how much we make within the video let's leave let's leave let's see what you got we move on audition here we'll see really um really it comes down to how good you make me look
8399,low_026,client,okay
8400,low_026,counsellor,so
8401,low_026,client,alright
8402,low_026,counsellor,let's see about that there's a whole different motivation here a little bit my cessation here's what even agent yeah yeah I'm yeah maybe you guys can talk okay um I think I'm actually going to go ahead and just do it let's see okay so um and in his name
8403,low_026,client,um Dennis
8404,low_026,counsellor,Dennis okay alright and just so just substance abuse treatment counseling who knows exactly why he's here so
8405,low_026,client,yeah alright
8406,low_026,counsellor,so Dennis
8407,low_026,client,hey hey good good
8408,low_026,counsellor,alright well um so I got a little bit of information as to why you're here but but maybe you can go ahead and just tell me
8409,low_026,client,yeah well my wife basically just said if I don't get um final stop drinking then she's leaving
8410,low_026,counsellor,Wow okay so she's doing pretty tough stance on it
8411,low_026,client,yeah yeah she said you know she's told me for a long time that she doesn't like it and our kids have said they don't like it she's never she's kind of threatened it but I think she needs it this time I don't
8412,low_026,counsellor,okay all right so pretty important to you I mean she's taking the stance on it your kids have said similar things
8413,low_026,client,yeah
8414,low_026,counsellor,and now you're here I mean it's gotten point that you've you agreed to go ahead and go into treatment she's saying not just get treatment she's saying quit I mean Jesus she's being pretty
8415,low_026,client,yeah she just wants me to stop pretty
8416,low_026,counsellor,out of about it okay so what do you think
8417,low_026,client,well I'm thinking that I've worked hard my whole life and I should be able to to drink if I want but you know I don't you know I never been arrested you know I've got I've done really good with the money that we have you know we live a pretty good life she gets to do what you wanted I get to do what I want and this is just something that I want to do so you know I and it's been that that you know I've been drinking since I think we met
8418,low_026,counsellor,yeah
8419,low_026,client,we can vary it a long time
8420,low_026,counsellor,oh
8421,low_026,client,so I don't know what I I'm kind of like I know what the big deal is really and
8422,low_026,counsellor,all right
8423,low_026,client,I don't want to quit
8424,low_026,counsellor,what's always you feel you know I mean it's like you know you work you're responsible you do what you think is expected of you and so it kind of feels a little unfair to you know you're a man you're a head of the household you know you're doing your duty and it feels a little unfair to have people trying to dictate your behavior and telling if you've got to give this up
8425,low_026,client,yeah I don't like it people tell me what to do
8426,low_026,counsellor,yeah no no
8427,low_026,client,usually I just usually if someone tells me what to do like tell him to back off
8428,low_026,counsellor,wouldn't know what to do
8429,low_026,client,and so but she's serious it's time so I don't know what to do so
8430,low_026,counsellor,all right all right well so I guess that's kind of the that's the dilemma I guess you know on the one hand she's uh she's very out of it she's very concerned and is making her expectation very clear on the other hands you know you're being asked to give up something that you don't particularly want to give up um what do you think what do you think she's what you put why do you think she's so concerned
8431,low_026,client,well she says she's worried about my health you know cuz I have high blood pressure you know worried about because my dad died of a heart attack at a really early age so she's afraid I'm just gonna I'm just gonna drop dead you know I outlive my dad by so many years and I you know and again it's my life
8432,low_026,counsellor,yeah
8433,low_026,client,so
8434,low_026,counsellor,yeah yeah certainly it's you know people can tell you what they want
8435,low_026,client,right
8436,low_026,counsellor,you know and but all ultimately it's up to your choice what you're gonna do so you know she she can threaten you and she can she can tell you that you know if you don't do this she can you know she's gonna leave and she can leave you know it sounds like you really don't really don't want that but but you know everybody's got their choices to make in this situation okay so she's concerned about your health and has pointed out that you have a you know your father so he drank and that's but
8437,low_026,client,I was really little
8438,low_026,counsellor,okay
8439,low_026,client,when when he died
8440,low_026,counsellor,so I don't know so you're not sure if that
8441,low_026,client,we died of heart attack
8442,low_026,counsellor,okay
8443,low_026,client,you know
8444,low_026,counsellor,so you're not sure if that played a role in his heart attack or not
8445,low_026,client,I probably did probably crank song but
8446,low_026,counsellor,so you're not sure about how well you know he died did it earlier and she points that out as evidence that like you've got media genetic predisposition to having health related problems associated with drinking
8447,low_026,client,yeah the doctors have said I should quit drinking the doc or they know
8448,low_026,counsellor,okay
8449,low_026,client,you're not convinced but with the doc don't exactly that 20 years ago I need to quit drinking and
8450,low_026,counsellor,okay so it almost seems like evidence to the opposite they told you to quit drinking 20 years ago and here you are it's still alive then
8451,low_026,client,I pretty much do whatever I want when I
8452,low_026,counsellor,yeah
8453,low_026,client,you know
8454,low_026,counsellor,surely
8455,low_026,client,no life because the way it's been I've given everybody wrong
8456,low_026,counsellor,yeah
8457,low_026,client,of everybody
8458,low_026,counsellor,okay
8459,low_026,client,so else you can say the live
8460,low_026,counsellor,yeah
8461,low_026,client,you can say that
8462,low_026,counsellor,okay max
8463,low_026,client,I'll work my way up I'm working my way up and once really high up my confident for a retiree
8464,low_026,counsellor,okay huh
8465,low_026,client,you've always thought I would do it
8466,low_026,counsellor,so it's kind of you know the state you know you have this determination you're the kind of person that you know you you do what you trust your gut and you do what you think you should do and you know you work real really hard and you and you've had a lot of success in your life
8467,low_026,client,is right
8468,low_026,counsellor,it seems like in your in your job and and and with your family the fact that you're a married man with kids and you know you've raised them up and you know I think there's no denying that you had a lot of success in real life in it and and you know and you know better than anyone how hard you had to work could she be back so um and
8469,low_026,client,she doesn't get she doesn't she wasn't I don't think she recognized how hard I worked for it to have what we have
8470,low_026,counsellor,okay
8471,low_026,client,you know and I wish she just let me live the life I've always wanted to live you know and then part of its drinking I like drinking so
8472,low_026,counsellor,okay okay all right so she's got all these concerns about it how do you and you mentioned your kids have some concerns - they talk about it I mean what is your sense of and it sounds like so far you feel like well I've beaten the odds and I'm this kind of guy like I'm always a kind of guy that sort of pushes the envelope and you know has proven a lot of people wrong over the years and so you're very skeptical when anyone tells you that drinking is going to kill you like
8473,low_026,client,yeah is it
8474,low_026,counsellor,it's almost like if somebody tells you that you're gonna say you know you're not gonna believe that I mean you just don't believe that's the truth
8475,low_026,client,well I would yeah because it might kill other people but I'm not going to let kill me
8476,low_026,counsellor,okay okay all right so what so what if anything in what they're telling you do you believe it turns out like a possible negative effects that I may have obviously it has not killed you you're standing here right now
8477,low_026,client,yeah
8478,low_026,counsellor,okay so as it killed you but do you think but have you seen any do you think there's anything to anything any validity to what your wife is saying your kids and the doctors with regards to having a negative effect on your health or otherwise I mean just just very honestly if you sit there and you look back and kind of go well and is there anything that you think that is going on that that it's valid right now
8479,low_026,client,if I if I tell you what I'm really thinking are you tell my wife but
8480,low_026,counsellor,no no I mean confidentiality is such that no I want you to know I'd never feel comfortable talking
8481,low_026,client,I do not assess us but you know I think you you I think you kind of get me kind understanding so I really you know my um my son's in AAA
8482,low_026,counsellor,okay
8483,low_026,client,and and you know when he went into his treat treatment and he really was hard on me like he said that he blamed me for him you know get you know going down that path and and and I really felt like maybe I could have done more he and i were really close now we're not as close because he I can tell you this doesn't like to be around me as I drink and my daughter is she sent me a letter a while ago saying that she loved me and that she didn't want me to die and wanted my kids to be around her but her kids to be around me but she um she didn't want him around as much because cuz she didn't like it when I'm drinking so well so yeah I've had I've had those couple things that that maybe go maybe maybe that maybe I need to rethink this yeah and then I'm always one way and that's really like I still want to lose her I just don't
8484,low_026,counsellor,well you know gosh I really appreciate the Jew did you feel comfortable sharing with me to know who those things with me and and I can see that you know this has been very painful and I just I can't commend you enough for being willing to put yourself out there and come in and trust this process it's not easy to do so I really appreciate the fact that you've done that
8485,low_026,client,thank thanks for talking again together I'll be hopping your straight shooter I really appreciate that
8486,low_026,counsellor,alright okay thank you very much

8489,low_027,client,alright
8490,low_027,counsellor,okay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself

8500,low_027,counsellor,that's great what do you think you'll study
8501,low_027,client,well I'm I'm looking at the journalism maybe pre-law
8502,low_027,counsellor,Oh neat
8503,low_027,client,which is a little different but
8504,low_027,counsellor,yeah that's great that's a really good goal
8505,low_027,client,yeah thanks
8506,low_027,counsellor,it's a hard work to get into law school are you doing school what kind of grades do you get
8507,low_027,client,I'm doing okay I'm getting mostly A's and B's so we're pretty good okay
8508,low_027,counsellor,okay what classes are you not getting A's and B's in
8509,low_027,client,um I think all my grades raisin B's
8510,low_027,counsellor,oh
8511,low_027,client,yeah
8512,low_027,counsellor,okay and do you know where you're going to apply to college
8513,low_027,client,I'm not sure yet but I'm looking into schools if like in the area so maybe I don't know maybe I only poem or something
8514,low_027,counsellor,okay cool and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism
8515,low_027,client,um well I'm definitely not a math or science person so I started off by there that I start looking at careers that maybe I would like so
8516,low_027,counsellor,okay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties so do you drink alcohol
8517,low_027,client,um not really maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most
8518,low_027,counsellor,okay and how often do you think you drink
8519,low_027,client,um maybe like once or twice a month at the most
8520,low_027,counsellor,mm-hmm so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol
8521,low_027,client,yeah
8522,low_027,counsellor,okay and so that's maybe like 20 times a year
8523,low_027,client,possibly yeah
8524,low_027,counsellor,so that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then
8525,low_027,client,yeah I guess you can say that
8526,low_027,counsellor,okay what do you think's the most you've ever had
8527,low_027,client,um just two drinks at a party at the most I don't I don't like to drink a lot I don't getting drunk is not something that appeals to me so I just have like a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking I just like to look like I'm actually doing something most a lot of time I don't even drink at all so
8528,low_027,counsellor,but you've been drunk before
8529,low_027,client,um no not really maybe tipsy but not like drunk
8530,low_027,counsellor,okay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day
8531,low_027,client,yeah
8532,low_027,counsellor,okay interesting so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol
8533,low_027,client,um yeah yeah
8534,low_027,counsellor,okay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing all right have you ever done that have you ever done
8535,low_027,client,never drunk driven and I've never got in the car with a drunk driver
8536,low_027,counsellor,okay how much do your friends drink
8537,low_027,client,um I mean I have some friends that drink someone others like my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that but I know that there are people that
8538,low_027,counsellor,okay
8539,low_027,client,drink a lot more
8540,low_027,counsellor,what about at these parties you're going to there are other kids there who are drinking a lot
8541,low_027,client,yeah there are kids that drink a lot more than I do definitely you
8542,low_027,counsellor,and do you hang out with them
8543,low_027,client,not really closely like I know who they are and I'll say hi but not they're not really that close friends of mine
8544,low_027,counsellor,mm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk did you know that
8545,low_027,client,um yeah that make sense
8546,low_027,counsellor,yeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accidents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted
8547,low_027,client,yeah
8548,low_027,counsellor,you know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about that
8549,low_027,client,yeah yeah I have that's one of the main reasons I don't like to drink that much so
8550,low_027,counsellor,and then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that
8551,low_027,client,yeah definitely
8552,low_027,counsellor,but you're still drinking
8553,low_027,client,yeah I mean I guess it's the thing to do at a party so
8554,low_027,counsellor,so I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney
8555,low_027,client,um definitely not that's why I don't try to drink that much just make it look like I kind of
8556,low_027,counsellor,okay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer
8557,low_027,client,okay
8558,low_027,counsellor,um obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that
8559,low_027,client,"I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol other than the ones you mentioned, like health-wise and things like that. So I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing."
8560,low_027,counsellor,so do you think you can quit
8561,low_027,client,um yeah I mean it's not like a really big part of my life so
8562,low_027,counsellor,okay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit
8563,low_027,client,okay
8564,low_027,counsellor,and that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision um so I guess can you quit this weekend then
8565,low_027,client,yeah yeah definitely I'll just not have a drink
8566,low_027,counsellor,okay and then what about your friends who are still drinking
8567,low_027,client,um I really can't control what they do but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will
8568,low_027,counsellor,okay and what if they won't
8569,low_027,client,well then I guess I'll just try to hang around unless or something or try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party anything
8570,low_027,counsellor,yeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should just find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence
8571,low_027,client,okay yeah
8572,low_027,counsellor,and then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol
8573,low_027,client,okay yeah definitely
8574,low_027,counsellor,okay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking
8575,low_027,client,they would be pretty upset yeah they don't really condone alcohol use oh
8576,low_027,counsellor,okay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then um okay yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here
8577,low_027,client,no I think I'm good
8578,low_027,counsellor,okay um any questions or
8579,low_027,client,no no
8580,low_027,counsellor,okay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in

8596,low_028,counsellor,if you open them up and pay them it would help

8614,low_028,counsellor,I know I mean I know you've been in rehab several times. I was myself until it worked. But it worked eventually and I really really think the same can happen for you.

8640,low_029,counsellor,you need to have to spend your money wisely honestly you really do like why are you not spending on bills and right that's the most important
8641,low_029,client,I'm spending it on what I want I'm spending it on what makes me feel good
8642,low_029,counsellor,and what does make you feel good
8643,low_029,client,having fun makes me feel good and that's why I spend my money
8644,low_029,counsellor,not be prostituting yourself that is not fun something
8645,low_029,client,I need one money that I get from benefits. I can't go out and get a job because then I won't get my benefits. And I do you progressed so well to say that.
8646,low_029,counsellor,and then you just got down you I don't understand what
8647,low_029,client,I do what I know. I know how I feel when I'm selling myself and I get the money.
8648,low_029,counsellor,do you like to feel such views do you not do like to not know what's going on
8649,low_029,client,I feel confused when I'm clean I feel confused when I'm here listening to all your demands

8651,low_029,client,it makes me comfortable to get high my dope is my eye I feel good on drugs I know how to how to feel on drugs I don't know what to do with myself when I'm not
8652,low_029,counsellor,yeah but tell me laid honestly all you need to do is just go the right path to do better for yourself in the future you don't know what's going to happen and you really ought to be lead to better yourself
8653,low_029,client,I don't know how I can charge
8654,low_029,counsellor,spending start calculating how much money you spend and how much money there you go the whole system thinking
8655,low_029,client,I can't do these things
8656,low_029,counsellor,trust me
8657,low_029,client,I can't confused I think I do something
8658,low_029,counsellor,I'm personally been in your shoes I used to be a driver
8659,low_029,client,no
8660,low_029,counsellor,no you don't know this I'm telling you it's honestly I used to be drug drug addict myself and trust me it was the hardest point in my life right it is but
8661,low_029,client,I we're not the thing about I hope you counselors that used to help me and I've been in rehab so many times and every time come back out into the world hits the fan and everything's back together
8662,low_029,counsellor,no I'm not out there helping
8663,low_029,client,yeah I don't look comfortable when I'm high and I know how to get more money and I know prostitution isn't like the perfect thing society wants me is what I know and I don't fit in I want to come home I bore you to try being
8664,low_029,counsellor,exactly where you have been honestly I really have and I know exactly what you feel
8665,low_029,client,I can't do what you did I don't fit in
8666,low_029,counsellor,I can't be just mean you can I
8667,low_029,client,"I've helped many people before. I don't want I'm in into your life. I'm not going to stop there. I want to help you. I honestly do. You need to know you want to get you. That's not going to do anything. Trust is what makes us. Honestly, how many things understand money management? You cannot be in Siskiyou timing in right."
8668,low_029,counsellor,no
8669,low_029,client,and then if you think this is the world right I understand it and you cannot be there are people living around the world people living around money to me I think
8670,low_029,counsellor,I don't give a crap about other people
8671,low_029,client,you cannot be the center and other people's know you
8672,low_029,counsellor,never up crap about me
8673,low_029,client,who's gonna give a crap about a drug addict and prostitutes herself at all people are better themselves obviously that you cannot be judge of attention you need to talk
8674,low_029,counsellor,and it's too much and get too confused I can't do all these things you did my hands from me now you can turn it into this
8675,low_029,client,you can do it trust me you can do it
8676,low_030,counsellor,Good morning. It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking. What have you got in mind? What do you want from us?
8677,low_030,client,well I need some medication if you can offer me some
8678,low_030,counsellor,Absolutely when the right place for that.
8679,low_030,client,and whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free
8680,low_030,counsellor,okay what just remind me in why is you want to stop
8681,low_030,client,it's just these days I'm finding that I'm smoking 20 30 a day of getting sick of it in certain I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking
8682,low_030,counsellor,good and severe depression here
8683,low_030,client,especially the other night I was at the restaurant it's been embarrassing on the only walk walking out
8684,low_030,counsellor,so that can't feel like I'm comfortable being myself so that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's all getting smelly and it's getting see any other reasons um
8685,low_030,client,it's expensive these days it's actually cause to believe this about our buyer go through pack a day so it's almost seven pounds
8686,low_030,counsellor,seven pounds a week or
8687,low_030,client,seven pounds a day today
8688,low_030,counsellor,forty
8689,low_030,client,fifty
8690,low_030,counsellor,could really quit we even my math you see okay so we're talking about spec fifty couldn't we being one of the few left smoggy in your crowd and not liking the smell that sounds like three reasons do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes eight okay so have you got a date in mind when you like to stop smoking
8691,low_030,client,what you do what do you suggest
8692,low_030,counsellor,generally it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains one of the main reasons why you actually smoke what you enjoy most about
8693,low_030,client,it's just something when I bought it oh my god I smoke or something I go out as I said I'm the only one kind of outside thank you
8694,low_030,counsellor,do you think you'll be supposed about the sort of stresses
8695,low_030,client,just when I go down after a break at work I go down I just need break away from it all just a shelf so I really enjoyed that the cigarette just helps me calm down
8696,low_030,counsellor,does your favorite cigarette the day
8697,low_030,client,it's definitely the one at the end of evening
8698,low_030,counsellor,at the end of the day I think that helps you just online put an end to the work section and move into your own time
8699,low_030,client,yeah
8700,low_030,counsellor,okay so after you've had the quit date what do you think you might do when is the first day at work it's time if you're not gonna cigarette
8701,low_030,client,I guess I'll just I'll just have some fresh air as well but this time without a cigarette in my hand to try and give myself regular breaks one of those tough things
8702,low_030,counsellor,how do you manage to stop sneaking in the past
8703,low_030,client,I've managed for a couple of weeks and
8704,low_030,counsellor,what got you back it was
8705,low_030,client,to be honest is stress an argument with my partner
8706,low_030,counsellor,remember it says I make just how many I sort of took you back into right let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here you really want to sort of thinking with this we kind of the last guy in your group still smoking it costs a lot of money and you don't be like smell the main reason that you smoke is because at the end of the day gives you the kind of relaxation and there's quite a little stress is going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with what you like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible when do you think would be a good time for you to choose to being your quit date okay
8707,low_030,client,so the weekend I've got a party coming up so maybe Monday morning
8708,low_030,counsellor,Monday morning after party really good day that's next week okay now one of the things that we do the pharmacy is recommended medication to help you know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely come along a lot of people make using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches gum you probably seen people using any of these products and other options are tablets which you can get from the GP local champion again so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings
8709,low_030,client,I'm thinking one of these patches
8710,low_030,counsellor,okay so patches I think you've already seen them again I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like this course of medication lasts for ten to twelve weeks and we strongly recommend that we will stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success stopping smoking is not easy but it's and when the type of support we offer here in the pharmacy you absolutely make your chance of success for x greater than try on your own so that's why it's really good that you come to see me you said that you really want to do it and then next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party's opened up with you've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette so what I like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with often a person who smokes that's exactly what it feels like when they're craving for cigarette what does it feel like to you thing that you want one
8711,low_030,client,it's just like a irritable
8712,low_030,counsellor,okay and that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happen to you so I would strongly recommend that you have the patch talk about how to use it and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation coming out that typically in that first week so you're happy with the date for me okay would you like to come back and see me again other and what would you like me to do if you don't come back
8713,low_030,client,nice Frank
8714,low_031,counsellor,I you know you don't have to sign up if you don't want to but you know I'm kind of here to like fix things for you and just make sure everything goes no real smoothly with the different issues that you've been having and just kind of oh you know kind of manage things and just take care of stuff so you know it's again if you want the service you can have it but it's kind of up to you but I am here if you want me to be and you know I'll couldn't kind of teach you about things you might not know about or tell you some things about your house and you know just Marlys make sure everything goes okay so you know you think that might be something you'd be interested in wanting to be a part of because I'd you know really like to help you
8715,low_031,client,okay well sure when you put it that way sure
8716,low_031,counsellor,because it seems like I you know you've expressed some health issues lately and I know you've had a lot of problems with your weight so that's certainly something we can talk about and I know a lot about you know weight loss and have helped a lot of people with you know managing their weight and figuring out what they need to do so you know what are your main problems about your weight I mean why is it a problem for you
8717,low_031,client,um I eat too much you eat too much yeah
8718,low_031,counsellor,so why do you eat too much I mean how is that a problem
8719,low_031,client,because whenever I'm stressed out about anything it makes me feel relaxed and calm
8720,low_031,counsellor,so you like it you just like eating food so you just kind of eat more than you know you should be eating
8721,low_031,client,yes like do you know about portion control has anyone told you about like you know a card size for a piece of meat or some salad I mean have you has anyone showed you that cuz I can pull out our
8722,low_031,counsellor,yeah yeah
8723,low_031,client,samples and give you those that I could probably tell you about it
8724,low_031,counsellor,you could tell me about it I mean about what you should be eating for yeah meat size and like you know baseball size for fruit so it's not that you don't know about it you you you do know about poor lighting control
8725,low_031,client,yeah
8726,low_031,counsellor,so if you know how much you should be eating and then how is it a means you know how much you should be eating then how do you stop
8727,low_031,client,well I guess you told me that you know a lot and you can fix my problem so that that's interesting I'm that's one of the reasons why I decided to participate so I was wondering if you could tell me
8728,low_031,counsellor,well that's great I could do about this yeah because you know there's there's just so many different things when it comes to like weight loss you know and really being able to have some self-control I mean that's a really really important factor this is really being able to have some self-control and you know I found a lot of people just really need to increase their fruits and their vegetables and just not eat any processed foods and you know not eat any anything that might be kind of junk but then you know not not cheat either I mean you want to be able let yourself have some ice cream or some things that you might really like from time to time because you know you don't want to completely not let yourself have good stuff either so
8729,low_031,client,It sounds though that you're seeing some opposite things because when one moment you're saying not have any don't have any junk but then allow yourself ice cream once in a while. So that would make it really confusing for me.
8730,low_031,counsellor,oh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure I have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then I can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising that's certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising
8731,low_031,client,oh I haven't been exercising lately
8732,low_031,counsellor,oh so see that's really key right that's a really key portion to it so it sounds like when we talk next time if you kind of kind of give me an idea maybe keep a journal for a week and tell me what you've been eating and we can really look at you know what good things that I can tell you what things you shouldn't be eating out of that plan and then I really think it'd be important if you just start maybe even just start walking three times a week if you could just start that really slowly and then you Muenster now we can kind of see if that's helped some and we can talk about the items you've had on your journal and we can go from there and all kind of direct you from there what you shouldn't be eating how does that sound
8733,low_031,client,well what does walking three times a week like for how long really like you know
8734,low_031,counsellor,sure whatever whatever is comfortable for you so you know start out small so that you can feel really good about having some success and doing some exercise so you know if you feel tired at ten fifteen minutes really just kind of paste it along for yourself and feel what's right so that you can feel like you're getting out there and getting moving because it's all about taking a small step and you know at least getting active
8735,low_031,client,okay
8736,low_031,counsellor,and then I think the flute journal would be really important because then we'll really have a better idea what you what you truly are eating and how many calories and then we can go from there and deciding you know how many calories you really should be eating in your diet and that way you can do a better job of monitoring it
8737,low_031,client,okay
8738,low_031,counsellor,so how about we meet back and say three to four weeks and we can kind of see how that journal is going so
8739,low_031,client,that seems like a long time I mean I think in three to four weeks a lot of things can happen and I think these things
8740,low_031,counsellor,yeah if you have any problems along the way before then feel free to give me a call I'm always available so if there is something that you find that's just not working just give me a call we can kind of discuss it but then we can meet in person because we really should probably have about a month of your journal you know kind of down but if there's something that comes up I mean by all means just give me a call there's my extension so you'll call me if you you know
8741,low_031,client,my weights been coming up so I think things will come up in a month
8742,low_031,counsellor,yeah well I I would hope that with some you know with some exercise and with starting to be more aware by writing down what you eat you may find it as you have to write it down that you may find that you will avoid eating certain things because you don't want to you know as you write it down it may make you feel like well now I'm not so sure I should eat this like if you're gonna eat a whole container of ice cream you know you might not want to have to write that down so you may just limit yourself to a scoop or two of ice cream so there is some kind of pieces that help with having to write things down and I think we're just gonna take it step by step but again there's my phone and my extension so I'm here if you need me
8743,low_031,client,okay
8744,low_031,counsellor,so let's just continue on our conversation that's so Tonya I'm really glad you were able to kind of come in and just talk with me for a couple minutes as I explained kind of briefly on the phone as part of your insurance benefit I'm available for you as your own personal coach you know I am a nurse but I have a lot of background in wellness so I've been really here to help guide people and kind of as a case manager I'm able to help you there help empower you don't kind of work towards your goals of what you're trying to work on with your health and I know you would express on the phone a little bit but I would love it if you tell me some more about you know what is one of maybe the main things you've been thinking about in relation to your health right now
8745,low_031,client,okay well basically I feel like if I don't if I don't stay on certain habits and routines then everything just kind of goes kaput
8746,low_031,counsellor,so the structure is really important to you in your life in order to manage your house
8747,low_031,client,yeah I realize there's certain things I have to do in order to stay on on track yeah or else everything just kind of then I start noticing that I get into this whole this whole myriad of unhealthy unhealthy things I feel yucky basically
8748,low_031,counsellor,so it almost sounds like a house of cards if one kind of shifts away from from that
8749,low_031,client,hmm
8750,low_031,counsellor,they just kind of all fall down very quickly and then you start to not feel good about yourself or you don't start to feel good in general physically
8751,low_031,client,yeah I don't start field of it in general physically and then I you know I I yeah I can feel a change in my body and I just feel yucky because I'm then I end up not doing anything really
8752,low_031,counsellor,oh okay so because you start feeling poorly or you started feeling badly then you just kind of say well whatever or
8753,low_031,client,yeah yeah it's kind of I move on and good habit reinforces on the so they build upon each other and it's sort of like if I don't have that collection of good habits then yeah I start to feel it because I'm not exercising and then I start to feel you know the fat come on and yeah
8754,low_031,counsellor,for you it feels like this whole kind of circle of things almost the quickl you're not doing what you need to be doing then you start to feel a weight difference in your weight
8755,low_031,client,yeah
8756,low_031,counsellor,so it just kind of builds on itself
8757,low_031,client,yeah
8758,low_031,counsellor,so what do you see is the key goal that you're trying to focus on right now or maybe a group of goals what are what are your key things that you are wanting to have happen
8759,low_031,client,well I think just doing those things that do make me feel good you know tell me a little bit about those drinking water eating a certain amount of fruits and vegetables per day giving a certain amount of activity in per day and I was just thinking lately what's important to me is having one kind of thing that I do around physical activity that's social so I'm around other people and I realized that that makes a big difference to
8760,low_031,counsellor,Oh social physical activity
8761,low_031,client,yeah
8762,low_031,counsellor,that you get to be out and be with people like
8763,low_031,client,yeah j
8764,low_031,counsellor,Just doing on your own right like even going to a gym and just being around other people working out. We're going to some kind of exercise class just to be around other people who they're their general goal is to you know do physical activity and feel better through it.
8765,low_031,client,hmm so that you kind of feel like you're in a partnership together
8766,low_031,counsellor,yeah
8767,low_031,client,that's rather than just you're wrong
8768,low_031,counsellor,yeah
8769,low_031,client,yeah I'm working toward this together as a group
8770,low_031,counsellor,yeah
8771,low_031,client,so you've talked about several different kind of pieces that are important to you if we just took a look at that one activity because that sounds like a newer thing that you're really trying to push with where would you put yourself on how important this is to you want to say on a scale of one to ten just just on importance
8772,low_031,counsellor,yeah right now I realized that it would be this is just something I came to realization today so it would be about I think it's an eight
8773,low_031,client,Wow eight
8774,low_031,counsellor,yeah it's really really up there
8775,low_031,client,yeah
8776,low_031,counsellor,it's not a four or five right why would you say an eight not a four or five
8777,low_031,client,because I that it's a it is important for me to have social interaction and be around people who are doing like I guess you'd say like-minded like-minded things and then it becomes less just about me and more about you know just sharing
8778,low_031,counsellor,oh okay it's about sharing there's that yeah really that piece of connectedness that's really important for you
8779,low_031,client,yeah
8780,low_031,counsellor,so if we were to ask your second question and that's kind of where the rubber meets the road how confident are you that you could start finding a group activity let's say in the next two weeks
8781,low_031,client,oh
8782,low_031,counsellor,you could start one obviously you've got steps to find it
8783,low_031,client,right
8784,low_031,counsellor,involved but within two weeks you could find yourself in some type of a group activity
8785,low_031,client,two weeks seems reasonable I think I can do it within two weeks so I would give that a eight
8786,low_031,counsellor,so you would get that in ages yeah so it's something that's pretty important to you
8787,low_031,client,yeah
8788,low_031,counsellor,definitely more than a six or seven and also you're really confident that you can go out there and do that
8789,low_031,client,yeah
8790,low_031,counsellor,what do you see as some of the barriers that might get in your way
8791,low_031,client,um I guess just structuring my time better
8792,low_031,counsellor,structuring your day better
8793,low_031,client,yes yes so really not slacking off and really not saying okay well I'm tired you know now tonight I'll just wait till tomorrow basically that
8794,low_031,counsellor,so finding the time in your day
8795,low_031,client,yeah
8796,low_031,counsellor,able to do or not do this or not
8797,low_031,client,yeah
8798,low_031,counsellor,and how do you see that best in your day how do you see that working in like an evening kind of thing or
8799,low_031,client,the evening yeah yeah right now the way the way just my today is structured with what I need to do in terms of um work and other commitments
8800,low_031,counsellor,okay
8801,low_031,client,evening yeah
8802,low_031,counsellor,so one of the things I hear people frequently will be saying is that the evenings my time to unwind and then I don't have the energy or I don't feel like going out to do something that might be more rigorous how is that for you
8803,low_031,client,I think that would be that would be okay I could always have a cup of coffee beforehand
8804,low_031,counsellor,you can always have a cup of coffee
8805,low_031,client,yes yes
8806,low_031,counsellor,well it would be okay with you I would to touch base maybe after that class starts and just kind of see what you found how it's working and then we can go from there looking at any kind of barriers the one thing I think I would just encourage you with to normalize is to realize about doing things in small doable steps and not feeling like if you haven't done everything for the day that you're
8807,low_031,client,right
8808,low_031,counsellor,the day but but that anymore water you drink or vegetables you've added it's certainly a positive and looking at trend
8809,low_031,client,right
8810,low_031,counsellor,then to be hard on yourself right towards your you know movement toward wellness
8811,low_031,client,right
8812,low_031,counsellor,okay so if we could touch base maybe in three weeks
8813,low_031,client,sure
8814,low_031,counsellor,that would be super I'd really look forward to it I'm really glad you came in
8815,low_031,client,okay thank you
8816,low_032,counsellor,okay it's a good morning my name is Jane
8817,low_032,client,yeah I'm Michelle
8818,low_032,counsellor,okay so I'll be regional therapist today and the doctor recently told you the UH pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news so that I can better help you
8819,low_032,client,um well I mean I wasn't really expecting this it really caught me off guard and I know what I eat isn't always the healthiest you know but I didn't think things were this bad I mean my life is pretty hectic so I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself
8820,low_032,counsellor,yeah so you were pretty shocked and I'm sensing it might be quite scared too
8821,low_032,client,yeah I'm a little scared but more worried than anything I mean my career is really important to me and I don't really want my pre-diabetes to set me down and I don't really want to have to take medication I'm absolutely terrified of needles so I don't want to be picking myself all the time and then watching what I eat and counting carbohydrates and everything it just sounds like a whole lot of hassle that I don't have time for it you know
8822,low_032,counsellor,you feel like having diabetes will cause some unfortunate lifestyle changes what I'm hear you say is you don't want your bad health to affect the way to affect your career
8823,low_032,client,mm-hmm basically I guess that's what there's so much of mark that I've kind of forgotten to take care of myself and I guess I'm really she did myself in the foot because that's what's cosmic pre-diabetes you know so you feel like you're just not giving the attention your body really deserves
8824,low_032,counsellor,mm-hmm yeah and I obviously haven't been this way like when I took this job I guess that's when my health started spiraling downwards and I don't know I guess that's when I kind of noticed things were kind of off as far as my health goes so
8825,low_032,client,can you tell me a little bit more about what you do well I'm an ESL teacher so I teach English to foreign students and adults I work in a community center close by but I also spend a lot of my days traveling it's just part of the job so I eat out often and always on the go and it makes following a healthy diet and lifestyle pretty difficult and I mean I know exercise and diet I guess that honestly could work out at the gym at the hotels but they aren't always available you know okay
8826,low_032,counsellor,so you recognize the importance of exercise yeah I do but when I get that free time I just want to veg out you know you don't really want to have to come back and go to the gym you know so that's part of it too
8827,low_032,client,so yeah I think that you should make exercise a part of your life exercise is huge in managing your diabetes if you're overweight it can help you lose weight exercise can also help with your blood sugar and it can also reduce your stress levels
8828,low_032,counsellor,um well I guess I mean it could be a way for me to avoid getting diabetes and yes taking medication
8829,low_032,client,I think yeah I think exercise is the right step for you to stop the progression of your diabetes um so how many days a week do you think you can exercise
8830,low_032,counsellor,um I mean right now I just want to say one because you know when I travel I'm not really sure if there's ever going to be anything available and um I don't know I'd like I don't even like exercise so it would be a big step a big change for me
8831,low_032,client,can you make it a goal to exercise three to four times a week I need you to do it more than just one day
8832,low_032,counsellor,um I mean that might just be a little too much for me honestly I mean maybe when I'm stuck in a hotel and they have a gym I'm just unsure as whether I can commit to doing that much because I mean I don't want to buy a gym membership here because I'm not at home enough to use it and I feel like it would just be a waste of money
8833,low_032,client,and I really think that making exercise important part of your life is
8834,low_032,counsellor,yeah I mean I just I don't know it's it's just difficult for me you know like I said I don't enjoy it to begin with so it would be a really big step
8835,low_032,client,I'll tell you what you should do I'll give you the name of my trainer just come in mention my name and he'll take care of you his name is George this is this hot Italian guy he really makes working out a walk in the park so you'll go see him
8836,low_032,counsellor,I mean maybe that I still don't know
8837,low_032,client,this will be great for you I'm being physically active is an essential part in the treatment of diabetes it'll lower your blood sugar body fat your body fat will decrease and you'll really feel so much better
8838,low_032,counsellor,yeah I mean like I said we'll see
8839,low_032,client,well thanks for coming in today I feel very confident about this exercise thing that we'll be successful next time you come in we'll look at the progress you made and it kind of increased the number of times that you're exercising a day
8840,low_032,counsellor,I'll see you next time
8841,low_032,client,okay
8842,low_032,counsellor,bye thank you
8843,low_032,client,T
8844,low_032,counsellor,so good morning my name is Jane yeah I'll be your nutritional therapist today so the doctor had told you recently that you have pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news just so that I can better help you
8845,low_032,client,um Wow I mean I wasn't really expecting any of this at all you need to kind of caught me off guard and I'm still kind of in shock I mean I know what I eat is only the healthiest but I mean my life is pretty hectic so I mean I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself I just didn't think it was that bad you know I had pre-diabetes or anything
8846,low_032,counsellor,so see you were pretty shocked with this news and I'm sensing you might be quite scared too
8847,low_032,client,yeah I mean no worries me quite a bit my career is really important to me and I really don't want dive used to slow me down of course nobody wants to take medication and I am definitely afraid of needles so I mean I don't want to be picky myself all day and I'm an ESL teacher and basically I teach English to foreign students and adults and so I work at a community center close by but I also travel quite a bit which I mean I eat out often just because of that and I don't really get to exercise much because I mean a moment ago and some of these hotels don't really have any gyms or anything in the areas are places where you want to go and run and so I mean following a healthy diet is would be pretty hard and I mean I guess I could maybe work out that some of those gems but you know after a long day honestly all you really want to do is just veg out you know and not really have to go to the gym and you know sweat
8848,low_032,counsellor,yeah so you feel like travel at first the affects your health but you recognize the importance of exercise and diet
8849,low_032,client,yeah I mean I know it's good for you but I absolutely hate exercising I mean I think it's so boring and I just I don't know it's not comfortable and I just I don't like making the time for it you know what my life is so busy it's just the last thing on my list so
8850,low_032,counsellor,but your lack of exercise is a concern to you it sounds like yeah a little bit I mean it does bother me like when I was younger I was much thinner and I exercise all the time not do all these sports and everything so I mean it definitely does concern me a little bit you know that I've gotten so far from that you know
8851,low_032,client,so you mentioned that your bother by the way that you look and you also mention that your diet is less than helpful
8852,low_032,counsellor,yeah like I said I have to eat out often just because I travel a lot and also I am always on the go so I'd like driving somewhere like Panera I love Nara and I usually get like breakfast or lunch there sometimes both I think one of my favorite things is the super little bread bowl and I end up usually eating a majority of the bread ball which I know it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world and of course they give you those other options like the apples in the salad but I mean I like to stick with stuff that I like and I don't know like any of that and I mean I also don't eat too many sweets you know I mean so I think I'm okay you know sometimes I eat fine but when I travel I do like to try all the local restaurants and everything sometimes that is a bakery or - my absolute favorite thing in the world peanut butter and jelly donut I mean if you haven't tried them I'll bring one in for you to try because they're absolutely heaven and my dr. pepper honestly you can't live without my dr. pepper
8853,low_032,client,alright
8854,low_032,counsellor,what keeps me going so okay
8855,low_032,client,so you mentioned there are healthier options available in restaurants that you go
8856,low_032,counsellor,yeah
8857,low_032,client,and you said you don't eat sweets often but you also mention your dr. pepper and I can't help but recognize this huge
8858,low_032,counsellor,yeah
8859,low_032,client,that's on our desk
8860,low_032,counsellor,yeah
8861,low_032,client,I mean CERN is what keeps me going throughout the day I mean obviously the caffeine and then a little bit of sugar kick that it gives me it really helps me get through those really long days you know and I mean I've been drinking these things since I was a teenager so I mean just just second nature it's just habit you know
8862,low_032,counsellor,so soda is that energy boost to help you through the day
8863,low_032,client,mm-hmm and I mean I just stopped by the gas station on the way to work I mean like I don't know it's just stuff it make in the morning you know just have it like I stopping it guess I maybe make it another one you know that mean yeah it's just part of my life you know
8864,low_032,counsellor,okay so we could go in a number of directions here and I wonder which makes the most sense to you um you mentioned exercise possibly getting some healthier options when you go out and you also mention your soda consumption you may also have other things that we haven't mentioned today that you would like to discuss further so which would you like to discuss
8865,low_032,client,um I mean I guess I should really cut down and soda I mean I know it has a lot of sugar in it and maybe that'll help with the pre-diabetes a little bit I just get so tired throughout the day and like the caffeine obviously and a little bit of sugar kick really helps me keep going throughout the day you know so
8866,low_032,counsellor,so it sounds like your soda intake uh something that you know is that a control and you must not feel that energized if you have to keep drinking it throughout the day
8867,low_032,client,yeah I mean I do normally feel really a sluggish and fatigue all day long you know so it could be part of it
8868,low_032,counsellor,so your soda consumption's a habit you'd like to break
8869,low_032,client,yeah I mean really in lieu of the shocking news it might be time to change
8870,low_032,counsellor,so would you like to hear some ways that my other patients kind of get an energy boost that are not soda
8871,low_032,client,yeah I'm gonna say I would love any suggestions I mean my tolerance for caffeine has just increased so much that like some days let me drink two or three of these and I know that's not really recommended so yeah I would like to hear some alternatives
8872,low_032,counsellor,so my other diabetic patients that like caffeine and a little sweet they will either have one cup of coffee in the morning or they'll drink unsweetened tea and if you like something we don't really condone artificial sweeteners but you could add a packet of stevia Splenda to your tea that's not a problem so how does that sound
8873,low_032,client,um I mean I sound I think that sounds okay um I do you like sweet tea or sweetie sometimes unsweet tea so I think I'll be okay with making that switch to like an unsweetened stevia or something so I mean I could definitely make some switches you know
8874,low_032,counsellor,so you sound ready to make a change you sound ready to go um do you perceive any obstacles or challenges that you might foresee with changing your soda intake
8875,low_032,client,mm-hmm I definitely think I will crave the sugar I'm really afraid I won't make it throughout the day without caffeine you know so that I mean those are definitely things that I see as barriers you know to me making these changes you know
8876,low_032,counsellor,so that's definitely a legitimate worry I think the smart thing to do is to gradually wean you off sooner um I think you might be feeling a little lethargic and fatigued just because you're dehydrated so maybe swapping out some of the soda for water tea somedays will definitely help you out
8877,low_032,client,um I mean that it sound it definitely sounds fine I think I can definitely swap out some of the soda with tea or coffee I mean that'll help me with the caffeine withdrawal you know and maybe I could even increase my water intake I know I heard it also helps with fatigue you know so I mean it's definitely doable and I'm living it something I could do
8878,low_032,counsellor,great and next time we can even talk about your diet because I know fruit and vegetable intake can also give you a natural energy boost so
8879,low_032,client,yeah
8880,low_032,counsellor,okay so those ideas sound really great in our sessions coming to a close I just wanted to thank you for being so open today and next time you come in we can talk about your diet and your soda consumption if you ever have any questions we're right here just give us a call but again thanks for coming in
8881,low_032,client,yeah sure I'll see you next time

8900,low_033,client,golden retriever
8901,low_033,counsellor,oh nice
8902,low_033,client,Charlie
8903,low_033,counsellor,Charlie
8904,low_033,client,Yeah
8905,low_033,counsellor,have you had him a long time?
8906,low_033,client,yeah he's about eight years old now
8907,low_033,counsellor,oh gosh okay very cool. and what are your plans for after high school?
8908,low_033,client,uh well I'm planning on going to school I'd like to become a doctor one day
8909,low_033,counsellor,Wow
8910,low_033,client,I'm interested in psychology psychiatry something like that
8911,low_033,counsellor,you've got big dreams.
8912,low_033,client,yeah
8913,low_033,counsellor,Alright have you started thinking about schools or majors? I guess you're thinking about psychology
8914,low_033,client,I haven't really thought too much about which school I mean I everyone wants to shoot for the Ivy League
8915,low_033,counsellor,alright and how about your grades?
8916,low_033,client,they're pretty good you know high three point something
8917,low_033,counsellor,okay good very good. Alright well what are the kinds of things do you do for fun on weekends?
8918,low_033,client,oh I usually go out with my friends. we'll go to the movies or will most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house and just hang out of things
8919,low_033,counsellor,mhm... when you're hanging out is there ever alcohol sometimes?
8920,low_033,client,I'm gonna be Audie sometimes
8921,low_033,counsellor,so how often do you think you drink alcohol?
8922,low_033,client,um um...depending on how much schoolwork there is when there's not it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month
8923,low_033,counsellor,oh so you're drinking a lot. oh yeah okay and how much are you drinking on the days that you're... on the days that you drink?
8924,low_033,client,um I don't we don't get blackout drunk or anything it's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing I have gotten blackout drunk before but I kind of did that learned my lesson nothing like it
8925,low_033,counsellor,got it. so you've you've had some pretty heavy drinking. what do you thinks the most you've ever had? like how many drinks?
8926,low_033,client,yeah um it was a good amount it was the first time I ever drank and it was three or four cups but it was mixing different things
8927,low_033,counsellor,okay so you don't even know. okay so and then your friends drink too?
8928,low_033,client,yeah yes not all of them.. some of them
8929,low_033,counsellor,"okay, and how much do they typically drink?"
8930,low_033,client,more or less the same amount so right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup I don't do that one time but sometimes one or two but they can be kind of heavy
8931,low_033,counsellor,okay so it's one cup but let's imagine not what I drink a lot of alcohol in it okay. so gosh you're you're actually really drinking quite a lot you know your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group so is that surprising to you?
8932,low_033,client,a little bit yeah
8933,low_033,counsellor,so we caught high risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that so you know things like having car accidents or other accidents or getting in fights or you know sexual assault or health problems or developing alcoholism have you thought about those things?
8934,low_033,client,not too much to be honest I've always thought since it's you know within my small group of friends and we usually sleep over each other the house we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving and possibly sexual assaults and things like that but I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything
8935,low_033,counsellor,"Okay, so it's good because you are not drinking and driving but you're still really drinking a lot and yeah okay so let's let's talk a little bit about that how you might be able to make some changes cuz I think you really need to need to stop drinking like this"
8936,low_033,client,okay
8937,low_033,counsellor,so do you think you could quit drinking? or..
8938,low_033,client,yeah I think I could I don't need it for instance it it is used as a kind of like let's get the party going uh-huh we haven't always had it obviously so I think it would be possible to stop drinking
8939,low_033,counsellor,okay so does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?
8940,low_033,client,um I would probably start off by like because my friends are also involved so I feel like hey guys I don't think I'm gonna drink today and kind of see how that goes
8941,low_033,counsellor,okay cuz you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work
8942,low_033,client,yeah it's you know it's one thing to control my own drinking and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure I was thinking I think I look stupid okay
8943,low_033,counsellor,so how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid..
8944,low_033,client,yeah
8945,low_033,counsellor,okay so I mean do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?
8946,low_033,client,my close ones I know they wouldn't be you know have a problem with that but the ones that I'm not that close to its but I'll still like hang out with those are probably the ones that I think made ostracize nice or something
8947,low_033,counsellor,it sounds like you might be better off without them though there yeah maybe not very good friends probably
8948,low_033,client,might be too judgmental mm-hmm
8949,low_033,counsellor,so so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking and I think you should probably stop as soon as possible like this weekend okay so the way this normally works is you know we set your goal and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple weeks and make sure that you actually stopped and so what do you think about?
8950,low_033,client,that I think I think the possibility okay so make a good plan like I think I'd be able to follow
8951,low_033,counsellor,okay great so the plan is going to be that you're gonna quit and the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive you're just gonna not hang out with anymore yeah okay and then um you know like are your friends in band drinking?
8952,low_033,client,um not not really the ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends okay my friends we're focused on bands uh-huh can't relieve
8953,low_033,counsellor,okay so that might be good is really just to focus more on band um cuz you know the other big concern I have for you is if you want to go to medical school you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this yeah you know like college is gonna be really hard and especially without those pre-med classes you're not gonna be able handle it. Drinking this much you know have you thought about that?
8954,low_033,client,not too much to be honest yeah
8955,low_033,counsellor,okay so setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you and it sounds like it shouldn't be that tough really especially because you can just stop hanging out with the people who drink a lot since you have some other friends yeah so do you have any questions for me? or...
8956,low_033,client,what should I write yeah I do so what should I say like once let's say I hang out with my friends and I like they why aren't you why aren't you drinking
8957,low_033,counsellor,mm-hmm
8958,low_033,client,like how should I go about that situation
8959,low_033,counsellor,well you know one good option would be to just review with them all the bad things about alcohol you can say you know I thought about it and I realized it's gonna mess up my homework and you know it's really a lot of risk for my health I don't want to become an alcoholic you know I don't want to get liver disease I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents or getting in fights you know one thing you could bring up is I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid and then people post stuff on Instagram and you know that's it for their social life it's like over
8960,low_033,client,so and and you know like professional life as well I don't want that biting me yeah but
8961,low_033,counsellor,I think just tell your friends you know you realize there's all these bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore so you're just not going to okay and then you can tell them to stop - you know then that'd be really good good news
8962,low_033,client,you know as a group we but we all work together to become better yeah
8963,low_033,counsellor,yeah exactly all right any other questions or anything else I can help with?
8964,low_033,client,no I think I think I'm good okay so
8965,low_033,counsellor,like I said I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks and make sure that you actually quit drinking okay all
8966,low_033,client,right sounds good
8967,low_033,counsellor,great
8968,low_034,client,oh pretty good always busy this time of year but keeping up. How are you doing?
8969,low_034,counsellor,great... all right your blood pressure's over
8970,low_034,client,that's good right?
8971,low_034,counsellor,yes
8972,low_034,client,good I've always been really healthy
8973,low_034,counsellor,well not always it looks like you got a letter about your ac and you haven't been taking very good care of your diabetes
8974,low_034,client,my what?
8975,low_034,counsellor,your ac it measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months to determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar
8976,low_034,client,oh yeah I got that letter but I didn't really know what it meant and I never really pay attention to my diabetes because I feel fine. How bad is it?
8977,low_034,counsellor,it well let's see today it was eight point seven and three months ago it was so normal is less than six your way out of control
8978,low_034,client,well like I said I've been really busy this month
8979,low_034,counsellor,well your health is something you have to make time for. Have you at least been taking your diabetic medications?
8980,low_034,client,not really I'd rather use diet and exercise
8981,low_034,counsellor,well it looks like that's not really adequate so you need to be taking your medication. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough. your chart says that you've been prescribed metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think would be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?
8982,low_034,client,um yeah sometimes
8983,low_034,counsellor,okay how often?
8984,low_034,client,Oh once every few weeks but I feel fine so I don't think it's that bad
8985,low_034,counsellor,we'll remember your ac was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel so um it showed that you were out of control if you don't start making changes you could permanently damage your eyesight blood vessels even have to have a foot or leg amputated
8986,low_034,client,oh well I would definitely do something before it got that bad but I'm not interested in taking those medications I'll try to eat better or something
8987,low_034,counsellor,I don't think you realize how serious your diseases
8988,low_034,client,I don't see how I can be so sick if I feel fine I don't want to take medications
8989,low_034,counsellor,just because you feel fine doesn't mean you're healthy having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big old sore on their foot
8990,low_034,client,well I remember my doctor telling me something about the symptoms of high blood sugar like feeling shaky or tired but I never feel shaky and tired
8991,low_034,counsellor,well those are symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms that's the whole reason for doing an ac to determine if your blood Sugar's been out of control and your ac showed your blood sugar has them out of control
8992,low_034,client,"I get what you're saying but I feel fine and I don't want to take something that's not going to make me feel any better. I mean what if it makes me worse? When my grandfather was on heart medications, the levels got so high that he almost had a heart attack."
8993,low_034,counsellor,heart medications and diabetic medications are very different you can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication they're completely different. Will we at least try again taking your medications?
8994,low_034,client,I don't know I'll think about it alright
8995,low_034,counsellor,well we'll see you in a few months then
8996,low_035,client,okay
8997,low_035,counsellor,he said that you filled out the form and that you came to him for some medication for your stress but they're really concerned about your alcohol consumption. Before I made you any made any prescriptions for you so let me see that form please. okay thanks. yeah well it says here that you drink four more times a week and that you have for one or two drinks and that you go over that limit on a fairly regular basis that's too much that's too much I mean I imagine that he's already told you that he can't prescribe you anything unless you do something about his drinking
8998,low_035,client,okay I I'm really confused I he did want me to come and talk to you I'm just not real thrilled with the way this is going well
8999,low_035,counsellor,"I'm sure you're not because anybody that drinks at these levels isn't going to throw talking about her drinking with a professional like myself. What we know is that if you continue to drink at this rate, you're probably going to wind up drinking more and more. And imagine as he's concerned as you can order to me now."
9000,low_035,client,I think I was drinking that much I mean a you know one or two glasses of happy
9001,low_035,counsellor,this is a glass I mean this is a typical glass which is five ounces of wine but but what I know is that most people doing a lot more of that so what I'm pretty sure that your glass is recent bigger than that. What would you say?
9002,low_035,client,you don't... you are not in my household you don't know what idea it is about that size maybe maybe a little more
9003,low_035,counsellor,I don't I've been in the house where they have these stem glasses that's only a restaurant most people have tumblers so imagine that's why I find about good your cupboards and well anyway so what he said was that you came to him for some kind of benzodiazepine something for anxiety and we can't prescribe anything like that much if you're drinking of these levels so we need you to stop or at least cut back to reasonable levels which for you would be number three drinks in one setting which you're drinking over that now or no more than seven drinks among which you are well over right now so if you can agree to that and then perhaps you can make that prescription for I can't promise that either but but that's certainly one thing the other thing you need to do is to read this take this pamphlet and read it and you'll see in there that it tells you about limits of alcohol I think you'll find that if you if you can stick to there you should be okay you may be able to prescribe the medication at that point. I can't promise but if you do have problems and I'm suspect you may have problems coming back to those levels then we can make a referral for you to counselor to come and talk about your increased drinking. So any questions for me?
9004,low_035,client,and no no questions at all all right
9005,low_035,counsellor,well thanks I'll talk dr. Zeile you came in and you were reasonably compliant and that you said you'd follow through
9006,low_035,client,you tell me wherever you want
9007,low_035,counsellor,all right thanks
9008,low_036,counsellor,hi I'm Jacob
9009,low_036,client,hey I'm Dan Michi
9010,low_036,counsellor,I see been referred to me what brings you in today?
9011,low_036,client,yeah well just recently I've actually gained lots of weight and I'm trying to lose that weight I see I'm going into bariatric surgery soon so about pounds again that I'm just trying to find the best option that could work for me I've tried some commercial programs that didn't really work out for me I even had my own trainer and doing the exercise that I didn't really enjoy doing
9012,low_036,counsellor,do you understand all that?
9013,low_036,client,nothing helping me lose the weight and I think it's just got to be a way right
9014,low_036,counsellor,well you clearly have a lot of weight to lose cuz that feeling your main goal to lose weight
9015,low_036,client,yeah I need to lose the weight in order to get the surgery
9016,low_036,counsellor,have you tried any weight loss programs in the past? what kind of programs?
9017,low_036,client,um you know just some lifting the
9018,low_036,counsellor,Did you like those programs?
9019,low_036,client,well uh no I didn't either like it I had some pain especially my ankles so it wasn't really working out for me
9020,low_036,counsellor,what kind of activities do you like doing?
9021,low_036,client,I like to walk around outside I guess it with my dog
9022,low_036,counsellor,What kind of dog do you have?
9023,low_036,client,oh it's a golden retriever
9024,low_036,counsellor,yeah say like walking your dog
9025,low_036,client,yeah yeah it's only for a little bit before my ankles start hurting
9026,low_036,counsellor,how long do you walk?
9027,low_036,client,like three blocks I don't have too much dump for the day
9028,low_036,counsellor,all right well we'll have you do fire blocks done a couple of last couple blocks might hurt like something you have to push through and we'll have you do that six seven days a week don't you'll really get on and we'll see how that goes
9029,low_036,client,all right sounds good
9030,low_037,client,yeah I definitely don't want to come back here but the doc said Oscar my dog is connected to my asthma symptoms but the ridiculous part is I've had them for years before and now it's a problem
9031,low_037,counsellor,well you sound a bit surprise by that but I'm sure that you've see some of the material that that the clinic gave you about as with symptoms and managing your asthma and pets are a really big source of problems when that respect
9032,low_037,client,yeah let me just clarify I've seen the materials I have them I haven't read them all I've been doing is taking the medicine so I don't know that much about this
9033,low_037,counsellor,well wait a second Sal what do you mean you you have...? if you as an you know to be informed about I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby a new baby
9034,low_037,client,giancarlo yeah
9035,low_037,counsellor,and you are very concerned about your health you want to be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps you've almost quit smoking which is fantastic so the next step is to really deal with the dog deal with the pet I know it's it's gonna be hard to do that but there are always people who will adopt animals I'm sure that you have friends or family members
9036,low_037,client,ah this is a little too much weight now first of all giancarlo is taken care of that's fine he doesn't have no asthma from the dog it's just me I don't I knew that I'm worried about
9037,low_037,counsellor,Sal it's you that I'm worried about okay the symptoms are worse you've had two or three major asthma attacks and do you appreciate how this is a risk to your life that there are some some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms it truly is something to take very very seriously I can't emphasize that enough
9038,low_037,client,so Oscars gonna make me die? he hasn't made me die in years and the doctor saying oh I don't know if it's the stress the finance is the drinking so what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die I've had him for years
9039,low_037,counsellor,Sal what do you understand that what happened six years ago or ten years ago your asthma is progressively getting worse you know very well that the puffers the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone you know this
9040,low_037,client,well they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one I'll keep Oscar
9041,low_037,counsellor,so you're almost on the strongest one and if Oscar is that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your baby than your wife like that makes no sense to me do you understand how important this is?
9042,low_037,client,I understand that. I don't think you get my situation. I've had this dog for years so I'm not just gonna up and get him out of my house when I don't even know if that's the main thing. okay
9043,low_038,client,I did it it hey Doc I've been doing all right work was a little rough but uh I've been doing fine overall
9044,low_038,counsellor,okay I mean it's too bad to hear but you know what brings you in today?
9045,low_038,client,well I want to have bariatric surgery but my doctor says that I need to lose at least pounds in order to be eligible
9046,low_038,counsellor,okay sounds like you're concerned by your weight and you want to start to make positive changes so that's good to hear
9047,low_038,client,yeah you know I just really don't know where to start
9048,low_038,counsellor,hmm well I mean how confident would you say that you are right?
9049,low_038,client,I wouldn't say that I'm very confident I'm going to lose weight
9050,low_038,counsellor,okay well what have you tried doing to lose the weight?
9051,low_038,client,I've tried a few different diet programs and I've had decent success but I always seem to taper off and just lose like a game back away at last
9052,low_038,counsellor,okay what activities specifically we have you tried to learn?
9053,low_038,client,I enjoy weightlifting. I used to do that a lot with my friends. But I kind of stopped doing that. I didn't see any results as far as weight loss. And doing any kind of running always just seems to aggravate my ankle.
9054,low_038,counsellor,Oh didn't know you had an ankle pain but we can look at it later anyway um you know you're still going to need to do aerobic activities in order to lose the weight. it's proven to be the best way to
9055,low_038,client,okay what kind of aerobic activities do you want me to do?
9056,low_038,counsellor,well i'd say if your ankle pain doing brief walks every day maybe three or four and like take about minutes at a time that should help you
9057,low_038,client,all right back but what about my diet? program problems I just haven't even get anything to work
9058,low_038,counsellor,well you know you should eat more fruits and vegetables you know green anything green and stick with short walks and the resistance training like you said it's going to help you with the weight loss okay well do any other questions for me today?
9059,low_038,client,no I guess I'm good
9060,low_038,counsellor,all right well I'll see you to follow up in two weeks thanks
9061,low_039,counsellor,okay and is it for Molly?
9062,low_039,client,yeah okay
9063,low_039,counsellor,hi
9064,low_039,client,hi
9065,low_039,counsellor,how are you doing?
9066,low_039,client,good
9067,low_039,counsellor,well would you mind taking a seat I have a couple things I want to go over with you about this medication
9068,low_039,client,okay sure should have some time
9069,low_039,counsellor,okay well this should only take a few minutes. so before we get started I just want to make sure I still got all the correct information so you're still on Emma Street with the same phone number and everything right?
9070,low_039,client,yep
9071,low_039,counsellor,okay so nothing's changed wonderful. um now I was taking a look at your medication profile earlier and it looks like you're on two different strengths of lipitor so that obviously it can't be right
9072,low_039,client,yeah I don't think no I don't think that's what I do
9073,low_039,counsellor,Okay so do you remember which one you're taking?
9074,low_039,client,I don't know you don't know
9075,low_039,counsellor,okay I think you're taking the milligram tablets it's not right
9076,low_039,client,that sounds right and I remember the doctor was telling me that now that's that's what I'm doing now I'm pretty sure okay okay
9077,low_039,counsellor,"so the doctor gave you this new prescription but there's new medication, is that right?"
9078,low_039,client,I think so
9079,low_039,counsellor,okay okay so this medication is for your cholesterol
9080,low_039,client,okay
9081,low_039,counsellor,and you're going to take it once a day it's really important that you take it every day all right and you can take it with or without food it doesn't really matter okay and now the doctor did tell you this was your cholesterol right?
9082,low_039,client,yeah he said that's why I checked my blood last time that's why I was in for a visit

9104,low_040,client,thanks
9105,low_040,counsellor,it's a hard work to get into law school. How are you doing in school? what kind of grades do you get?
9106,low_040,client,I'm doing okay I'm getting mostly A's and B's
9107,low_040,counsellor,so we're pretty good okay okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?
9108,low_040,client,um I think all my grades raisin B's
9109,low_040,counsellor,oh yeah okay and do you know where you're going to apply to college?
9110,low_040,client,I'm not sure yet but I'm looking into schools if like in the area so maybe I don't know maybe I only poem or something
9111,low_040,counsellor,"okay cool, and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism?"
9112,low_040,client,um well I'm definitely not a math or science person so I started off by there that I start looking at careers that maybe I would like so
9113,low_040,counsellor,"okay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?"
9114,low_040,client,um not really maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most
9115,low_040,counsellor,okay and how often do you think you drink?
9116,low_040,client,um maybe like once or twice a month at the most
9117,low_040,counsellor,mm-hmm so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?
9118,low_040,client,yeah
9119,low_040,counsellor,okay and so that's maybe like times a year possibly yeah so that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then
9120,low_040,client,yeah I guess you can say that
9121,low_040,counsellor,okay what do you think the most you've ever had?
9122,low_040,client,um just two drinks at a party at the most I don't I don't like to drink a lot I don't getting drunk is not something that appeals to me so I just have like a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking I just like to look like I'm actually doing something most a lot of time I don't even drink at all
9123,low_040,counsellor,so but you've been drunk before?
9124,low_040,client,no not really maybe tipsy but not like drunk
9125,low_040,counsellor,okay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day. okay interesting. so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?
9126,low_040,client,um yeah
9127,low_040,counsellor,"yeah okay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing. all right, have you ever done that have you ever done ever drunk driven?"
9128,low_040,client,and I've never got in the car with a drunk driver
9129,low_040,counsellor,"okay, how much do your friends drink?"
9130,low_040,client,um I mean I have some friends that drink someone others like my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that but I know that there are people that okay drink a lot more
9131,low_040,counsellor,what about at these parties you're going to? there are other kids there who are drinking a lot?
9132,low_040,client,yeah there are kids that drink a lot more than I do definitely you
9133,low_040,counsellor,and do you hang out with them?
9134,low_040,client,not really closely like I know who they are and I'll say hi but not they're not really that close friends of mine
9135,low_040,counsellor,mm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?
9136,low_040,client,um yeah
9137,low_040,counsellor,that make sense. yeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted you know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about?
9138,low_040,client,"that yeah, I have that's one of the main reasons I don't like to drink that much"
9139,low_040,counsellor,so and then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that?
9140,low_040,client,yeah definitely
9141,low_040,counsellor,but you're still drinking
9142,low_040,client,yeah I mean I guess it's the thing to do at a party so
9143,low_040,counsellor,so I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney?
9144,low_040,client,um definitely not that's why I don't try to drink that much just make it look like I kind of
9145,low_040,counsellor,okay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer
9146,low_040,client,okay
9147,low_040,counsellor,um obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that?
9148,low_040,client,"I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol other than the ones you mentioned, like health-wise and things like that. So I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing."
9149,low_040,counsellor,so do you think you can quit?
9150,low_040,client,um yeah I mean it's not like a really big part of my life
9151,low_040,counsellor,so okay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit and that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision um so I guess can you quit this weekend?
9152,low_040,client,yeah yeah definitely I'll just not have a drink
9153,low_040,counsellor,okay and then what about your friends who are still drinking?
9154,low_040,client,um I really can't control what they do but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will
9155,low_040,counsellor,okay and what if they won't?
9156,low_040,client,well then I guess I'll just try to hang around unless or something or try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party anything
9157,low_040,counsellor,yeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should just find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence and then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol
9158,low_040,client,okay yeah definitely
9159,low_040,counsellor,okay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking they would be pretty upset
9160,low_040,client,yeah they don't really condone alcohol use
9161,low_040,counsellor,oh okay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then
9162,low_040,client,um okay
9163,low_040,counsellor,yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here no I think I'm good okay um any questions or no?
9164,low_040,client,no
9165,low_040,counsellor,okay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in
9166,low_041,client,actually I do want to speak to you about something to happen during this past weekend usually as you know I'm an honor student I usually am studying over the weekend my parents to let me go out to parties but I kind of used that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to and when I when I got there like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason because I was there in the moment I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing so I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized
9167,low_041,counsellor,yeah I get it like it we've all been there okay you know I was in high school once too you know I drank too I get it there's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but you know promise we have these rules and you're on a team you have to stick by the rules
9168,low_041,client,um I know that it's bad for me it's bad for my body it's bad for being on the team for being an athlete it hinders my performance just I don't know I feel that my friends pressure me I don't know if I should like go with different friend groups maybe I don't know
9169,low_041,counsellor,yeah Chris come on you're getting peer pressure I don't know like being in a sports team you feel very you have to like be unified with the group yeah well you're one of the leaders right and as being one of the leaders but my fellow teammates expect me to be except expect them to Li not only in the sports but also in social environments and if that's socialist social custom in our society so well maybe cancer leading as a non-drinker then I could but that could also backfire on me I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having a stick up my butt you know you're a star player who's gonna pick on you
9170,low_041,client,I mean it's just one I'm just one person
9171,low_041,counsellor,it's the all right well what's of the mob yeah so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on facebook you know they're there are rules at this school and in my job I have to enforce them so you know like I said I get it you know I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun your teenage years I get that but you know you are a star player we want to keep you on the team you know we got to figure out a way to get through this well I'll dedicate the time not to party and like no not-not-not party but you get involved with alcohol to that extent and like have it publicized on the Internet
9172,low_041,client,what do you mean like on facebook all the pictures that you saw on the internet like I avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so I'll just can see you're done
9173,low_041,counsellor,all right yeah I mean we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team okay right oh stop all right you promise all right shake all right. I'll see you later
9174,low_042,client,um I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn't like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I it all my friends were doing it and it was just it's it's not something that I like do it
9175,low_042,counsellor,Kate on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes. Otami there's so many consequences with drinking you know. You're not even yet you could get arrested. You could you know have a drunk driving accident. You could you know mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really really concerns me.
9176,low_042,client,right I get what you're coming from but I I really did I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone I didn't want to be in how do I put this like I wanted to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends were ok so I didn't let myself drink too much
9177,low_042,counsellor,there's really no such thing as not drinking too much I mean anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much you know like think about it think about all the things that can happen to you. yeah I understand exactly what you're saying and how much are you drinking?
9178,low_042,client,I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean it's it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do like by myself or whatever. It's just that. Is it like every weekend? Every other weekend I would say.
9179,low_042,counsellor,I'm just so concerned you know can't you think of anything better to do?
9180,low_042,client,um i guess i can i can probably be more productive in my school work and rather than going out to parties as much
9181,low_042,counsellor,and I do get where you're coming from and is are your friends the problem like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with
9182,low_042,client,yeah I guess I haven't really put it on myself I guess it's really been forced on their account and I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun and I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can
9183,low_042,counsellor,well there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice right that's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you and I just you know I really think you should think about making a big change here
9184,low_042,client,yeah I I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life too to a certain degree and it does make a lot of sense and I i guess i can put more effort into sort of lowering the level drinking
9185,low_042,counsellor,I think you really need to quit
9186,low_042,client,yeah I mean alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely i don't i don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life
9187,low_042,counsellor,I think you're wrong you know it really worries me anyway I wish you would quit if all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing you know I appreciate you talking to me about this but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it it's really important
9188,low_042,client,yeah i I just I don't see the problem in it right now maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but I'm
9189,low_042,counsellor,do you want to wait for that to happen do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?
9190,low_042,client,you're right I don't want I don't want to be too far gone before it's too late like I i can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape and I I guess I've never really had any any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much so I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of but in reality I might not have as much control as I think
9191,low_042,counsellor,all right well maybe it's something we can work on together and you know I think we should come up with a plan it's going to work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking
9192,low_042,client,yeah I think that that would be a good step forward into and a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol
9193,low_042,counsellor,okay sounds good by starting the
9194,low_043,client,yeah a depressions and
9195,low_043,counsellor,"I know you feel like depressed now but I felt depressed before and it will pass. You'll get over it. It's not that big a deal. And so this depression, why are you feeling depressed?"
9196,low_043,client,um
9197,low_043,counsellor,oh wait wait sorry I did another note something else I wanted to ask you before no why or is that depression what brought you in here?
9198,low_043,client,well I owed heed oh yeah because I was depressed as dad yeah
9199,low_043,counsellor,um okay so that overdose love to talk about um so then why are you feeling depressed?
9200,low_043,client,well um I was abused on I mean
9201,low_043,counsellor,you're like - I looked in your chart and your life doesn't seem all that bad so this depression I think you can get over it um yeah let me like my notes here no song oh hey yeah can I talk to you later I'm gonna finish on there okay um sorry I lost my train of thought my my notes here you got booze overdose um so can you talk about these thoughts? oh that like that what area do you want to do? um very still having those thoughts no no okay then great no that's because I know I mean if you're having them it's kind of like why I don't understand what people think of like it so it's really very weak them to do personally but any who is oh hold on a second hello no I'm at work right now yeah you know at Belmont yeah I want to talk with this patient here yeah I'll call you back okay okay all right yeah anyhoo so let me look at my notes but so you those thoughts were saying who are you saying about those? did you have that? I forget oh no no okay okay that's great I'm glad so are you feeling better than yeah so what do you think has worked in your therapy
9202,low_043,client,I'm talking to the therapist one-on-one
9203,low_043,counsellor,okay what do you want me to see if your doctors available? I can totally arrange that okay I'm going to go check that then
9204,low_043,client,right
9205,low_044,client,yeah my doctor thinks I'm too fat
9206,low_044,counsellor,could you explain thin detail? why you think so? so do you know the up as the risk of being being like overweight or obese?
9207,low_044,client,yeah probably just help you from you to lose weight you know like I don't think it's that big but I mean he was saying that like weight loss can just like prevent other diseases you know I have three kids I'm a single mom I want to be there for my kids
9208,low_044,counsellor,okay that's I mean I agree with you do you know what kind of risks or like the obesity will lead to?
9209,low_044,client,"No, like my doctor never told me"
9210,low_044,counsellor,"overall, obesity can lead to many chronic conditions. such as hypertension diabetes heart diseases, if you lose weight, it will lessen the risk of getting these diseases and a five to ten percent weight loss would really improve that. so what do you say?"
9211,low_044,client,I mean yeah that's the goal what tunnel is so
9212,low_044,counsellor,"so I just stated that unity you're willing to to set some goals, so what kinds of goals are you are you thinking of?"
9213,low_044,client,"you know, just to loose that five to ten percent weight"
9214,low_044,counsellor,yeah so let's start with this so what do you typically eat in the day?
9215,low_044,client,I normally skip breakfast. They are visiting. We came to school and then get to my job. And then at lunch salad. And then I don't really get home until late leeks eye with my other jobs. But then when I get home you know I'm so tired I don't really eat that much. I see whatever whatever is there.
9216,low_044,counsellor,okay so uh so what do you mean that was you don't eat that much or whatever's there?
9217,low_044,client,I mean you know like my mom watches the kids sometimes she's just like get something from like Japan like a restaurant you like McDonald's or Taco Bell. Manuel sometimes sure she'll save some stuff for me you know. I'll have like you know I had tacos or really considered looking more like to walk or something. Yeah I'm it's not it's not that much.
9218,low_044,counsellor,so wait so if you eat five tacos and some..?
9219,low_044,client,Oh no no sometimes above tacos and pizza taco bell
9220,low_044,counsellor,"Sorry, I just want to clarify. Okay and so so on a scale from one to ten how ready are you to make some changes in your eating habits or paths?"
9221,low_044,client,i'm probably five or six you know feel like it's hard
9222,low_044,counsellor,why do you think it's hard?
9223,low_044,client,because I mean like I feel like you're going to tell me that I can't anything I want to eat
9224,low_044,counsellor,no so you say that i'm not going to tell you so so you said that you on a scale of one to ten you're going the fastest it lets you choose five to six so you're you're ready for a change why do you choose five to six? why is it not a four or even
9225,low_044,client,i said i want to be there for my kids but you know I've done the south beach diet like the Atkins and all those eyes and I know what I have to do is sometimes hard to maintain that you know being a single mom and all yeah only want the south beach diet includes like cutting out anything that has spread in it or like and all you really is just like fruits and vegetables but and you can't eat like any fat or anything you know I thought you know some people move all the way but yeah
9226,low_044,counsellor,so you you want to lose right but you you just you just really like breads and carbohydrates and like you can't stay away from that?
9227,low_044,client,I just I need a yeah I mean I don't really have time to cook yeah well
9228,low_044,counsellor,so you've tried some diets before and they haven't worked out and since you're a single mom with kids is it's been hard for you to cook meals or do grocery shopping?

9260,low_045,counsellor,nice to meet you. tell me uh what brings you in today
9261,low_045,client,have a sore throat and a cough okay and I really wanted to get some antibiotics
9262,low_045,counsellor,okay so you have a sore throat and a cough
9263,low_045,client,yes okay
9264,low_045,counsellor,and when did this start?
9265,low_045,client,this morning this morning
9266,low_045,counsellor,yes so it just started today then
9267,low_045,client,yes I'm trying to cut it off at the past because if I just can't afford to be sick
9268,low_045,counsellor,okay so tell me a scale of zero to ten where zero is no pain at all on ten is like take me to the emergency room where would you say the pain is?
9269,low_045,client,uh I would say it's about a six so
9270,low_045,counsellor,it's any pain
9271,low_045,client,yeah yeah it's pretty painful
9272,low_045,counsellor,so you said you needed antibiotics
9273,low_045,client,yes yes there's a friend that I work with says that she tried antibiotics before it it stopped within the like two days so okay that's one that's what I want to do so you can just write me in prescription that'd be great
9274,low_045,counsellor,okay well I'll tell you what why don't I uh examine you first and let's see what that okay shows up and then we'll decide what we're going to do
9275,low_045,client,okay
9276,low_045,counsellor,All right so Sandy we did an exam and you do have some redness in the back of your throat but there's no pus or white stuff or anything back there. And your ears look okay and your eyes look okay. You don't have this to hurt just a little bit right? I understand and you have you don't have any swollen nodes or lymph nodes or glands in your neck or anything. And your lungs sound clear and your heart sounds great. Okay so this is probably a virus and for a virus you don't need antibiotics.
9277,low_045,client,oh so what are you trying to say you're not gonna give me antibiotics
9278,low_045,counsellor,uh no because you don't need them and now a friend where I work
9279,low_045,client,I work at CVS okay and she says that she took antibiotics when she had a sore throat and it was gone within like two days and so that that's why I'm here
9280,low_045,counsellor,okay so you work at CVS
9281,low_045,client,yes
9282,low_045,counsellor,in the pharmacy?
9283,low_045,client,uh no in the photo department
9284,low_045,counsellor,oh okay
9285,low_045,client,and my friend's a cashier okay but she knows you know we work at CVS
9286,low_045,counsellor,okay all right well I'll tell you with a virus a virus the antibiotics don't do any good so I just suggest you take some ibuprofen like milligrams every to hours for the pain and then gargle with some salt water and a tablespoon of honey and some hot tea will help but this will probably just go away in or days and you don't need any antibiotics
9287,low_045,client,so you're telling me you're not gonna give me antibiotics and I just paid a $ copay to come see you
9288,low_045,counsellor,well if you don't need them then you know part of my job is to tell you what's best for you so
9289,low_045,client,no you I'm not gonna read your prescription for any so then I'm just got to go see another doctor
9290,low_045,counsellor,well I'm sorry but that's you know that's your option I'll just send you the bill so sandy we did yours
9291,low_046,counsellor,well mr. I'd you know we've talked about it length at this visit we've talked about other visits as well you know I I just think you just need to make up your mind and just do it
9292,low_046,client,yeah but you know I'm trying to pass I just can't do it no matter what I do you know
9293,low_046,counsellor,I'm not really sure you tried that hard and last time remember last time you quit two days after your quit date you got laid off for several months I made it really difficult this time will be different and we have some new medication we can try and
9294,low_046,client,I've tried all those medications and I've tried all the patches and all that stuff and now that new medication I heard some crazy stuff about that
9295,low_046,counsellor,it's not as scary as what will happen to you to keep smoking besides I'll be monitoring your closely
9296,low_046,client,yeah it's just not a good time for me right now
9297,low_047,client,okay
9298,low_047,counsellor,good here take a look see what you think that feeling and the colors okay? you know there is quite a lot of stainings so I'm just wondering about um some concerns about smoking possibly gonna get that a coffee tea yeah have you heard this before yeah mm-hmm so you know the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically it infects dental caries dental cavities
9299,low_047,client,yeah
9300,low_047,counsellor,um healing yeah in your mouth okay
9301,low_047,client,sure so I heard it all I but I just want to get my teeth fixed
9302,low_047,counsellor,yes and I really want to be helpful I really want to you know my commitment is to your oral health so there are lots of medications out there David that actually take away a lot of the cravings there they make winning song to my old things
9303,low_047,client,I did try it so like I did try it I just did the pills and they didn't work yeah it was a waste and a cause more side effects
9304,low_047,counsellor,know it but David it's not a waste research hows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting
9305,low_047,client,or seven lectures along the road
9306,low_047,counsellor,well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture it's really not what I meant I know
9307,low_047,client,"I just feel that way. I get really, I get very defensive about when the brick because I get it from my family doc, my cardiologist. Everybody is like I'm not a complete fool. I am for smoking."
9308,low_047,counsellor,well there's there's a reason that other people are talking to quit no but as I said these medications so you've tried the medication you've been willing once then can I write you a prescription for the medication can we talk about how you could use it? because this is something that that's very important not just for your overall physical ha guess
9309,low_047,client,I got to really want to it Things I've tried usually caused me more problems than they helped
9310,low_047,counsellor,oh no the smoking is going to cause you more problems than the than anything else I can promise you that David the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking like that's the I think thing to really consider
9311,low_047,client,okay low can I go now?
9312,low_047,counsellor,I'm okay but you
9313,low_047,client,know i know it i know'd I know doc what you're trying to do with it I I just don't want to get into that right now
9314,low_047,counsellor,okay well thanks for listening and honestly I I am really worried about the smoking so okay
9315,low_047,client,I appreciate your care
9316,low_047,counsellor,I'm here to help
9317,low_047,client,okay okay
9318,low_048,client,I'm doing right how are you?
9319,low_048,counsellor,I'm good um Wow what's changed? what do we have here?
9320,low_048,client,oh I got my lip pierced
9321,low_048,counsellor,Emily why why did you get your lip pierced why? I don't wanted to change and you can kind of cool gorgeous your teeth are lovely you do not need a piercing
9322,low_048,client,I mean nobody needs up here saying I wanted one or
9323,low_048,counsellor,then do you know what those oral piercings can do to your teeth?
9324,low_048,client,I mean it's my lip that's pierced not my teeth
9325,low_048,counsellor,well yes except that you know what's going to happen see how do you feel how when you're moving your lips smile for me okay so do you see how when your muscles are moving that piercing is rubbing against your gums as well as your teeth? so we can see some recession that's going to start to happen yeah possibly affecting the tooth itself chipping the tooth etc so it's something that we definitely don't like to see
9326,low_048,client,I mean it's been okay so far it doesn't cause me any problems
9327,low_048,counsellor,well it's only been a month yeah okay orderly days yet and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing
9328,low_048,client,I mean I just chose it I'm not going to take it right out it's like you said I've only had it in for a month
9329,low_048,counsellor,I mean Emily I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you you know just mature etc and I hate I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this I really would
9330,low_048,client,well I mean if it starts to cause a problem then maybe talk about but at this point I mean all right
9331,low_048,counsellor,all right okay okay okay we'll continue the exam but you know where I stand on this okay all right all right
9332,low_049,client,yeah i got sentencing on friday and i had a chance to read my pretty sentence and i'm getting months so I'm kind of freaking out
9333,low_049,counsellor,freaking out about what?
9334,low_049,client,well I mean all kinds of stuff of me knew it what's going to happen I can truly get an months and I complied with all the conditions you ask what you're doing here I doesn't impact my sentence I've got it worried about my family what do I tell my job I'm just tempted to sit heck with it live it up what the heck
9335,low_049,counsellor,I'm sure you knew from the beginning you the options word you could go to jail we could be found not guilty but you elected to plead guilty so you knew the auction was it was very likely that you were going to go to jail
9336,low_049,client,well I mean I invited by all these conditions and it didn't do mean you get it exactly didn't do me a bit
9337,low_049,counsellor,you'll get an opportunity to walk in the court
9338,low_049,client,that's something versus coming in from the prison well the time did didn't count for towards my sentence
9339,low_049,counsellor,didn't know we explained that early on
9340,low_050,counsellor,okay well let me ask you a question and you can just explain it to the best of your ability but what do you think clogging is? how do you think it affects your teeth?
9341,low_050,client,well what clogging is it's a white substance that gets built up around your teeth and it can go to your gums and make your gums like red and inflamed
9342,low_050,counsellor,okay yes not only is the redness and the inflammation a problem but if you continue to let it get worse and worse you can actually deteriorate your bone routine now that you know more about black do you think stop flossing?
9343,low_050,client,no but it's just way too hard well
9344,low_050,counsellor,there's a lot of things in life that are hard but we all have to do them so I can give you some flossing it's that i recommend everything so basically just going to your lot more Walgreens or any and ask the person in the store to point you towards the right direction and basically you're looking for a class in hey and what you're going to do is we're going to take the floss and you're going to straight end and go in between your and then Glaus each individual tooth like that
9345,low_050,client,Wow but that still sounds like a lot of work
9346,low_050,counsellor,well you need to do it and you need at least try to do it because you don't your teeth when you could have just prevented it by doing it for a few much today
9347,low_050,client,okay I will
9348,low_050,counsellor,so I really want to see some improvement at our next appointment with the flossing technique that I have recommended for you and we'll see how you do next time
9349,low_050,client,okay
9350,low_051,client,yeah my asthma was just been out of control lately and my doctor says it might be connected to Oscar
9351,low_051,counsellor,hmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?
9352,low_051,client,"I've got allergy testing it's just the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing that's cut down and then they said the drinking might contribute to it too. So I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know the drinking, the smoking, and the dust that I got the scratch test for."
9353,low_051,counsellor,right
9354,low_051,client,and and that's what I know and that I take the medicine for it
9355,low_051,counsellor,okay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern?
9356,low_051,client,no I've had it for years and now it's a concern I don't understand hmm
9357,low_051,counsellor,yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free
9358,low_051,client,does that work what the boy said yeah
9359,low_051,counsellor,okay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards that
9360,low_051,client,mm-hmm I'm a little I'm a couple down I used to drink for a night now I'm down to three at least
9361,low_051,counsellor,okay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what
9362,low_051,client,what's next yeah yeah
9363,low_051,counsellor,okay so I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms?
9364,low_051,client,well we keep him clean like he's clean so all the dander doesn't really make sense but I have been noticing sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside I wheeze a little bit but I think it has to do with um the hair the in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking so I don't know if it's that that's where I'm confused I don't know how this could be happening
9365,low_051,counsellor,hmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution
9366,low_051,client,but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit
9367,low_051,counsellor,I guess I also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long mm-hmm mmm
9368,low_051,client,I just want some medicine I want to keep Oscar I want to feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life it honestly feels like my my nose is just above the water
9369,low_051,counsellor,mmm yeah and and in the end you know whatever you whatever you do about Oscar about your asthma about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda setting worksheet I mean you are in the driver's seat Sal it really is your choice
9370,low_051,client,hmm ya know that feels good that I you know ELISA it is my choice I just feel like just about I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up and I'm kind of sad about things and I don't know I don't know what to do
9371,low_051,counsellor,there's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife with the new baby and and now thinking about looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby you know
9372,low_051,client,I want Giancarlo to grow up with Oscar so he has his friend when he's young too and I just it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you got to think about and I'm not feeling good about it
9373,low_051,counsellor,mm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how would you know when you win or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not?
9374,low_051,client,yeah how would I know I don't know I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine if she gave me the strongest medicine and I wasn't working mm-hmm that would be the way right now cuz I can't see I don't know how I'm gonna give this dog
9375,low_051,counsellor,oh yeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry no no
9376,low_051,client,it's something I got to just sit there and kind of put the pros and the cons on the table about but something's going on
9377,low_052,counsellor,"Leann, I've noticed that it's been quite some time since your daughter's last dental checkup."
9378,low_052,client,I know I feel like I just can't find the time
9379,low_052,counsellor,I know that you know that dental health is really important especially for robbery and you've just got to try to make it a priority
9380,low_052,client,I understand it's a priority but I do also have to work to you know
9381,low_052,counsellor,I know and work can make a dental appointment difficult yeah
9382,low_052,client,it makes it very hard especially when I have to work days which
9383,low_052,counsellor,I see which makes a dental visit almost impossible it sure does could you talk to your boss about it?
9384,low_052,client,I don't think that's gonna work my boss is not very flexible
9385,low_052,counsellor,So what do you think will help
9386,low_052,client,I wish there was a dentist with evening hours
9387,low_052,counsellor,you know we do have some appointments that are later in the afternoon and we have appointments early in the morning or I could give you a referral
9388,low_052,client,okay but listen how often do you really have to come in there just baby teeth right that's right
9389,low_052,counsellor,but the baby teeth are really important for for eating and for speech development and to help ensure that the permanent teeth come in properly
9390,low_052,client,but the teeth aren't in bad shape
9391,low_052,counsellor,so tell me what you're thinking about the baby teeth
9392,low_052,client,well as long as she can eat fine and they look ok what does it matter they're just baby teeth the new teeth will come in eventually is there some other reason
9393,low_052,counsellor,you're right nutrition is important but the baby teeth are also important in speech and in space maintenance and just in helping the kids feel better about the way they look
9394,low_052,client,ok so it's to prevent problems later than
9395,low_052,counsellor,right it's all about prevention so what would you like to do now?
9396,low_052,client,well I think then maybe we could come in for an appointment before work what appointment times do you have you?
9397,low_053,client,I've been great thank you how about you?
9398,low_053,counsellor,good thanks for asking today we're going to start by just asking a few questions I was just wondering how your home care has been since the last time I saw you know? so what type of products are you using to clean your teeth and to help prevent the build-up of plaque and bacteria and stuff?
9399,low_053,client,well I've been using the manual toothbrush that you gave me in my last visit six months ago and then I've lost when I think about it probably only once a month and whatever I buy toothpaste I normally just get what's on sale to store
9400,low_053,counsellor,okay well that wasn't what I was expecting here and I'm pretty disappointed in your home care habits that's not the proper way to care for your teeth Oh as a professional and your hygienist I need you to buy an electric toothbrush because they remove way more than your manual one I also need you to brush twice a day and floss once a day and use some type of toothpaste of fluoride in it and lastly I really need you to use a mouthwash to prevent the build-up of bacteria and help print out everything out of your mouth after brushing and flossing
9401,low_053,client,wow that's kind of a lot for me to do all in one try I have a really hard time with mouthwash especially because it really burns my mouth and I end up having to spit it out really quickly because it just hurts me too bad and I have to drink a lot of water after to get the burning sensation in my mouth
9402,low_053,counsellor,well I know what I'm talking about i went to school for two years to get my degree and what I'm telling you is really important if you want to try to keep all of your teeth and not get gingivitis or periodontal disease do you not care about your health?
9403,low_053,client,I do but like I said it just burns my mouth so badly use mouthwash
9404,low_053,counsellor,you only have to swish for seconds and then go minutes without food or water if you can't handle that it's pretty embarrassing as an adult here's my favorite it's Listerine cool mint let me see you swish for seconds that way I know that you know what to do with the product when you get home and you can just keep that to spit out whenever I tell you that the time is up is it burning? mm-hmm keep going almost there okay you can go ahead and spit it out into the cup thank you so is it bad?
9405,low_053,client,yeah it really burned so can I have some water my mouth is really burning?
9406,low_053,counsellor,well you have to go minutes without it so it'll go by fast okay and then i'm going to give you this little mini bottle that you can take home with you until you go to the store to buy your own just make sure it's this one cuz that one's really going to clean your mouth the best even though it burns a little bit okay just remember it's the best for your help and if you don't want to lose your teeth then you're going to need to do that
9407,low_053,client,thanks
9408,low_054,client,okay well sure when you put it that way sure
9409,low_054,counsellor,because it seems like I you know you've expressed some health issues lately and I know you've had a lot of problems with your weight so that's certainly something we can talk about and I know a lot about you know weight loss and have helped a lot of people with you know managing their weight and figuring out what they need to do so you know what are your main problems about your weight I mean why is it a problem for you?
9410,low_054,client,um I eat too much you eat too much yeah
9411,low_054,counsellor,so why do you eat too much? I mean how is that a problem?
9412,low_054,client,because whenever I'm stressed out about anything it makes me feel relaxed and calm
9413,low_054,counsellor,so you like it you just like eating food so you just kind of eat eat more than you know you should be eating yes like do you know about portion control has anyone told you about like you know a card size for a piece of meat or some salad I mean have you has anyone showed you that? because I can pull out our yeah yeah samples and give you those that
9414,low_054,client,i could probably tell you about it
9415,low_054,counsellor,you could tell me about it? I mean about what you should be eating for ya meet size and like you know baseball size for food so it's not that you don't know about you you you you do know about poor iron control yeah so if you know how much you should be eating and then how is it let me know if you know how much you should be eating then how do you stop?
9416,low_054,client,well I guess you told me that you know a lot and you can fix my problem so that that's interesting i'm that's one of the reasons why i decided to participate so i was wondering if you could tell me
9417,low_054,counsellor,well that's great i could do about this yeah because you know there's there's just so many different things when it comes to like weight loss you know and really being able to have some self control i mean that's a really really important factor this is really being able to have some self control and you know i found a lot of people just really need to increase their fruits and their vegetables and just not eat any processed foods and you know not need any anything that might be kind of junk but then you know not not cheat either i mean you want to be able let yourself have some ice cream or some things that you might really like from time to time because you know you don't want to completely not let yourself have good stuff either so
9418,low_054,client,it sounds though that you're seeing some opposite things because when one moment you're saying not have any don't have any junk but then allow yourself ice cream once in a while so that would make it really confusing for me
9419,low_054,counsellor,oh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure I have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then I can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising it certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising?
9420,low_054,client,oh I haven't been exercising lately
9421,low_054,counsellor,oh so see that's really key right that's a really key portion to it so it sounds like when we talk next time if you kind of kind of give me an idea maybe keep a journal for a week and tell me what you've been eating and we can really look at you know what good things that I can tell you what things you shouldn't be eating out of that plan and then I really think it'd be important if you just start maybe even just start walking three times a week if you could just start that really slowly and then months from now we can kind of see if that's helped some and we can talk about the items you've had on your journal and we can go from there all kind of direct you from there what you shouldn't be eating how does that sound?
9422,low_054,client,well what does walking three times a week like for how long really like you know
9423,low_054,counsellor,sure what it was or whatever is comfortable for you so you know start out small so that you can feel really good about having some success in doing some exercise so you know if you feel tired at - minutes really just kind of pace it along for yourself and feel what's right so that you can feel like you're getting out there and getting moving because it's all about taking a small step and you know at least getting active okay and then I think the food journal would be really important because then we'll really have a better idea what you what you truly are eating and how many calories and then we can go from there I'm deciding you know how many calories you really should be eating in your diet and that way you can do a better job of monitoring it
9424,low_054,client,okay
9425,low_054,counsellor,so how about we meet back and say three to four weeks and we can kind of see how that journals going? well that seems like a long time I mean I think in three to four weeks a lot of things can happen and I think these things come on it yeah if you have any problems along the way before then feel free to give me a call i'm always available so if there is something that you find it's just not working just give me a call we can kind of discuss it but then we can meet in person because we really should probably have about a month of your journal you know kind of down but if there's something that comes up I mean by Allah me just give me a call there's my extension so you'll call me if you you know my weights been coming up so
9426,low_054,client,I think things will come up in a month yeah
9427,low_054,counsellor,well I I would hope that with some little you know with some exercise and with starting to be more aware by writing down what you eat you may find it as you have to write it down that you may find that you will avoid eating certain things because you don't want to you know as you write it down it may make you feel like well now I'm not so sure I should eat this like if you're going to eat them a whole container of ice cream you know you might not want to have to write that down so you may just limit yourself to scoop or two of ice cream so there is some kind of pieces that helps with having to write things down and I think we're just going to take it step by step but again there's my I'm phoning my extension so I'm here if you need me okay so let's just continue on our conversation that's so Tanya I'm really glad you're able to kind of come in and just talk with me for a couple minutes as i explained kind of briefly on the phone as part of your insurance benefit i'm available for you as your own personal coach you know i am a nurse but i have a lot of background in wellness so I've been really here to help guide people and kind of as a case manager I'm able to help you to help empower you don't kind of work towards your goals of what you're trying to work on with your health and I know you would expressed on the phone a little bit but I would love it if you tell me some more about you know what is one of maybe the main things you've been thinking about in relation to your health right now so the structure is really important to you in your life in order to manage your health?
9428,low_054,client,yeah I realize there's certain things I have to do in order to stay on track yeah or else everything just kind of then I start noticing that I get into this whole myriad of unhealthy things and I feel yucky basically
9429,low_054,counsellor,so it almost sounds like a house of cards if one kind of shifts away from from that hmm they just kind of all fall down very quickly and then you start to not feel good about yourself or you don't start to feel good in general physically?
9430,low_054,client,yeah I don't start feel good in general physically and then I you know I I yeah I can feel a change in my body and I just feel yucky because I'm then I end up not doing anything really
9431,low_054,counsellor,oh okay so because you start feeling poorly or you start feeling badly then you just kind of say well whatever or
9432,low_054,client,yeah yeah it's kind of a move one and good habit reinforces on the other so they build upon each other and it's sort of like if I don't have that collection of good habits then yeah I start to feel it because I'm not exercising and then I start to feel you know the fat come on and yeah
9433,low_054,counsellor,for you it feels like this whole kind of circle of things almost cyclical and the fact if you're not doing what you need to be doing then you start to feel a weight difference in your weight yeah so it just kind of builds on itself
9434,low_054,client,yeah
9435,low_054,counsellor,so what do you see is the key goal that you're trying to focus on right now or maybe a group of goals what are what are your key things that you are wanting to have happen?
9436,low_054,client,well I think just doing those things that do make me feel good you know
9437,low_054,counsellor,tell me a little bit about those
9438,low_054,client,drinking water eating a certain amount of fruits and vegetables per day getting a certain amount of activity in per day and I was just thinking lately what's important to me is having one kind of thing that I do around physical activity that's social so I'm around other people and I realized that that makes a big difference to
9439,low_054,counsellor,a social physical activity yeah that you get to be out and be with people like yeah just doing on your own
9440,low_054,client,right like even going to a gym and just being around other people working out we're going to some kind of exercise class just to be around other people who their their general goal is to you know do physical activity and feel better through it
9441,low_054,counsellor,so that you kind of feel like you're in a partnership together yeah that's rather than just your own yeah we aren't working toward this together as a group yeah so you've talked about several different kind of pieces that are important to you if we just took a look at that one activity because that sounds like a newer thing that you really need to push with where would you put yourself on how important this is to you want to say on a scale of one to ten? just just on importance
9442,low_054,client,yeah right now I realized that it would be this is just something I came to realization today so it would be about I think it's an eight T Wow on eight yeah no it's really really up there yeah it's not a four-fight right and why would you say it aint not a four or five? because I real i SAT tom it's a it is important for me to have a social interaction and be around people who are doing like I guess you could say like-minded like-minded things and then it becomes less just about me and more about you know just sharing
9443,low_054,counsellor,okay it's about sharing is that yeah really that piece of connectedness that's really important for you yeah so if we were to ask your second question and that's kind of where the rubber meets the road how confident are you that you could start finding a group activity let's say in the next two weeks? oh that you could start one obviously that steps to find it I involved but within two weeks you could find yourself in some type of a group activity
9444,low_054,client,two weeks seems reasonable I think I can do it within two weeks so I would give that a
9445,low_054,counsellor,so you would get that in aid as yeah so it's something that's pretty important to you yeah I'm definitely more than a and also you're really confident that you can go out there and do that yeah what do you see is some of the barriers that might get in your way? so finding the time in your day be able to do or not do this or not yeah and how do you see that best in your day how do you see that working in like an evening kind of thing around the evening?
9446,low_054,client,Yeah Yeah right now the way the way--just might today is structured with what I need to do in terms of them work and other commitments okay evening yeah
9447,low_054,counsellor,so one of the things I hear people frequently will be saying is that the evenings my time to unwind and then I don't have the energy or I don't feel like going out to do something that might be more rigorous how is that for you?
9448,low_054,client,"I think that would be okay. I could always have a cup of coffee beforehand. You can always have a cup of coffee at hand, yes."
9449,low_054,counsellor,well if it be okay with you I would love to touch base maybe after that class starts and just kind of see what you found how it's working and then we can go from there looking at any kind of barriers the one thing I think I would just encourage you with to normalize is to realize about doing things in small doable steps and not feeling like if you haven't done everything for the day that you are hailed the day but but that any more water you drink or vegetables you've added it's certainly a positive and look at my friend right then to be hard on yourself right towards your you know movement toward wellness right okay so if we could touch base maybe in three weeks sure that would be super I'd really look forward to it I'm really glad you came in okay thank you
9450,low_055,client,yeah I got a few moments
9451,low_055,counsellor,okay so I see that you're taking simvastatin amlodipine and sertraline I know this is kind of a lot of medications what patients have a lot issues taken all those medications dude do you ever miss a dose or how do you take them?
9452,low_055,client,I usually just take them right out of the bottle but yeah like you said it's kind of complicated so I missed doses here and there
9453,low_055,counsellor,what you missed doses?
9454,low_055,client,yeah yeah I mean it's complicated sorry
9455,low_055,counsellor,okay well a lot of a lot of people missed dose is what are you doing to kind of combat the missed doses?
9456,low_055,client,I usually don't worry about it little say any side effects from this feel any different if I suppose
9457,low_055,counsellor,well there's a lot of things we can do to kind of help you make sure you keep taking your doses it's a pretty important are you aware of like some of the benefits that always be on your dosage and taking them regularly has?
9458,low_055,client,I haven't seen anything I feeling different
9459,low_055,counsellor,yeah and make many faces sort of feel like that way but you really want to take care of your health and make sure that you're improving to the best of your ability in the long run so I can help you with some meds sync apps and that kind of stuff to help you walk through your medication to make sure you get the reminders that you need
9460,low_055,client,all right
9461,low_055,counsellor,yeah I need to respond to this real fast okay it's my girlfriend ok back to what I was saying is there anything else that I can help you with today? oh you you feel frustrated because it's so many medications it's hard that ok well we have a what's called a med box and a lot of patients like to use that so if you are Phil the communications that have been box I can help you with that and then all you have to do is no would you wants to take or what which time is there? already good that seemed like something you would want?
9462,low_055,client,oh yes yeah I think that'd make a nice today okay thank you very much yeah i would get that key to
9463,low_056,client,sure well
9464,low_056,counsellor,thank you so just briefly looking over this let me first verify what you're drinking? and how often? that sort of thing so we're on the same page what is it that you typically drink?
9465,low_056,client,just beer just beer no just regular beer
9466,low_056,counsellor,so I have a picture here this shows what a standard ounce beer looks like is that what she'd say you're drinking typically? okay so ounce beers how many days a week are you drinking?
9467,low_056,client,um most weekend I guess about three days a week on average
9468,low_056,counsellor,okay about three days a week and on each of those days how many beers are you drinking in a typical day?
9469,low_056,client,four or five sometimes a six-pack all right no more than that
9470,low_056,counsellor,so up to a six pack three days a week all right so based on that information that you've given me and then also looking at your questionnaire here I have some information that I can give you as just a way of giving you some feedback about your drinking is that okay sure with you okay well your score on this was so if you look right here on my card a score of places you in the high-risk room category yes sir so this means you are at higher risk for problems developing as a result of your drinking that could be accidents or Falls or even health problems like damage to your digestive system that sort of thing what do you think about that?
9471,low_056,client,well I sure wasn't aware that I like drinking with my friends and relaxing on the weekends at home watching TV some of my friends really do have drinking but I don't drink like that
9472,low_056,counsellor,so for you this information is not only new but it's really surprising yeah too and it could be that drinking at the level that you're drinking could be directly related to the stomach problems that you're talking about today what do you make about that information?
9473,low_056,client,well I don't know what to make of it it's surprising it's news to me
9474,low_056,counsellor,"I hear that. I can understand that. And like you said, for you, drinking with your friends is enjoyable and on the weekends at home helps you relax. I'm curious, what on the other hand would be some of the not so good things about drinking alcohol for you?"
9475,low_056,client,well okay thank you vineyard it hasn't caused any adverse effects that I'm aware of I'd never connect the stomach issue with drinking
9476,low_056,counsellor,so you see really no need to change your drinking? no not really okay well for a man your age in this high risk category it is recommended that you actually cut out drinking altogether to reduce that risk what do you think about that?
9477,low_056,client,well I'm not sure what to think about it I never considered not drinking I'd never thought that that what to me seems like a small insignificant amount of drinking is I never thought of that as being a problem
9478,low_056,counsellor,well it would definitely be my recommendation if you could even cut back you know half of what you're drinking then you'd cut that risk in half and again it's recommended that you quit all together and I would definitely suggest you work on that
9479,low_056,client,well I'll certainly think about it I appreciate the information okay well
9480,low_056,counsellor,thanks for listening thanks for discussing this with me
9481,low_056,client,sure thank you
9482,low_057,client,okay
9483,low_057,counsellor,I did notice that you filled out our alcohol questionnaire so we'll need to go over that before you leave. Let me just verify some information real quick. What is it that you typically drink?
9484,low_057,client,just beer regular beer just beer
9485,low_057,counsellor,so a standard ounces as standard can or bottle that's what you're drinking how many days a week are you drinking?
9486,low_057,client,I guess about three on average
9487,low_057,counsellor,about three days a week and how many beers on the days that you drink? usually four or five maybe a six pack okay so up to six drinks on the days that you're drinking about three days a week
9488,low_057,client,yeah
9489,low_057,counsellor,so based on that information that you've told me and then looking over your questionnaire here have to tell you for a man your age you're in a high-risk category really for Falls accidents other health problems that sort of thing developing in relation to your drinking what do you think about that?
9490,low_057,client,well I wasn't aware of that I don't drink that much I like drinking with my friends and on the weekends at home some of my friends really do have a problem with drinking but I don't think I do
9491,low_057,counsellor,well in my professional opinion you're really not too far behind your friends if you say that they're having some problems you've come in today complaining about the stomach problems and unless you're willing to quit or at least cut back those problems are bound to just get worse so what are your thoughts about that?
9492,low_057,client,I don't know what to think about that this is news to me I think I just need a pill for the indigestion could you just give me one of those purple pills
9493,low_057,counsellor,"Mr. Wilson, I could just give you a prescription and send you on your way. But again, unless you're willing to change your alcohol drinking, so quitting would be optimum. But at least cutting back the chances or you'll end up back here and we'll just be having the same conversation again."
9494,low_057,client,okay well just give me the prescription and I think I'll be fine
9495,low_058,client,okay
9496,low_058,counsellor,"I noticed that you filled out one of our drug questionnaires. May I take a look at it? Okay, so just to verify what you said on here, it looks like you do not drink alcohol and you do use drugs other than those required for medical reasons, just marijuana. marijuana and other drugs new street drugs?"
9497,low_058,client,no
9498,low_058,counsellor,what about medications for pain other than what or prescribed?
9499,low_058,client,no sedatives no stimulants now
9500,low_058,counsellor,okay how often you use marijuana?
9501,low_058,client,um about five times a week
9502,low_058,counsellor,five times a week yeah okay you know I wanted to show you on this chart here that using marijuana thought times a week the way you are and from what you said on our questionnaire put you in this category of being at risk
9503,low_058,client,oh really
9504,low_058,counsellor,yeah that needs to chew at risk for some health issues just like smoking cigarettes marijuana smoking can be harmful to your lungs and other parts of your body and I'd really recommend that you stop using marijuana okay you know that lack of energy that you talked about it could be that it's related to your use of marijuana and you are aware that marijuana is illegal
9505,low_058,client,yes
9506,low_058,counsellor,and you mentioned on your form that you feel guilty sometimes and I'm wondering if perhaps giving up that marijuana maybe that feeling of guilt would go away I know you you have a daughter
9507,low_058,client,and I'm not using around her and using something
9508,low_058,counsellor,that's illegal perhaps would make that guilt feeling go away
9509,low_058,client,"I really don't know what to think about this, thank you"
9510,low_059,client,after all that crying poor guy yeah well
9511,low_059,counsellor,the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia it's just an upper respiratory tract infection a cold so there's some things you can do to make to help him get better you can avoid excessive dust you can keep them hydrated avoid over-the-counter cold remedies keep them away from people who have flu or cold like symptoms and avoid smoke and the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy
9512,low_059,client,well you're right I did quit smoking when I was pregnant but actually a couple weeks ago I went out my mom was able to take Jake for the night and my friends they were having a birthday party and we had a couple glasses of wine and felt like old times so before I knew it I was out having a cigarette with them and since then I've been having couple cigarettes a day you know just at the end of the day after I put Jake to bed but that sounds like it has nothing to do with what you're talking about right?
9513,low_059,counsellor,no wait a minute that has everything to do with what we're talking about I can't believe at the end of this appointment you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again that's very very important information for me to know and I'd like to spend some time talking about it now
9514,low_059,client,well I had no idea that it was such a big deal I didn't think it would have anything to do with Jake getting sick or you know hurting him
9515,low_059,counsellor,come on Haley you're here because you thought he had pneumonia you're telling me that Jake can't breathe your concern about is breathing and then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risk that you're posing to yourself and your own health
9516,low_059,client,well you know I was doing perfectly well it was just when I went out with my friends and you know usually I'm fine with the cravings it's just when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day and if I have more than two or three I just get that craving for cigarette and five cigarettes in the house it just happens you know I'm doing pretty good
9517,low_059,counsellor,so it sounds like if you have alcohol then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do you need to go home and as your your son's doctor I need to tell you you need to go home and throw cigarettes you need to quit
9518,low_059,client,okay well yeah I guess I can throw the cigarettes and tomorrow night when I have my glass of wine we'll just try to avoid that craving
9519,low_059,counsellor,and let's talk some more about wine you keep throwing wine into the conversation it sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine how much are you drinking?
9520,low_059,client,only a couple of drinks a night you know it's pretty rare if I have anything more than that it's just my way of relaxing at the end of the day it's been so stressful since Jake came along it's just how I fall asleep at the end of the night
9521,low_059,counsellor,well no one says motherhood was going to be easy Harry so let's talk about these drinks are we talking about the low risk drinking guidelines one to two standard drinks a night? are we talking about a muggle margaritas?
9522,low_059,client,well
9523,low_059,counsellor,what are you drinking? what's the quantity that you're drinking?
9524,low_059,client,"I guess I have about a half a glass a night and maybe two. Very rarely I'll have more than that. You know, it just helps me kind of relax."
9525,low_059,counsellor,there's other ways to relax there's yoga there's deep breathing you need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid this is not okay you're not just worrying about Hailey anymore it's Hailey and Jake you're a mom now
9526,low_059,client,I didn't know it was such a big deal. I'd never thought it there would be any impact on Jake because of it.
9527,low_059,counsellor,"I'm trying not to be hard on you Hailey but I've got to tell you as a physician it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home, you're throwing out your cigarette, you're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol?"
9528,low_059,client,I guess we'll do the same thing I'll go home and throw out the bottles of wine and stop having a glass at the end of the day
9529,low_059,counsellor,sounds good and if you need to relax go for a walk join a moms group read a book how about you come back in a week when we have Jake six-month checkup and you can let me know how that quit plans going?
9530,low_059,client,okay I'll try my best
9531,low_059,counsellor,Thanks
9532,low_060,client,well I don't think I can quit right now because I'm too worried about the operation kind of stresses me out plus we've got family staying with us and everyone smokes in the house
9533,low_060,counsellor,I get that Noah but you're having surgery for cancer you got to do what's best for your health and you got to tell your family not to smoke around you then it might not be so hard to quit okay assume that means you agree? so I'm going to arrange for some nicotine replacement for you and I'd really like to see a quit within four weeks it's really the only option you've got to take responsibility for your own health okay we'll chat more next time I see you
9534,low_061,client,hello and you know um I'm just back again
9535,low_061,counsellor,yes yes yeah it's not that long since you were last here
9536,low_061,client,I know but I'm really not happy with these heavy
9537,low_061,counsellor,you're not happy

9551,low_061,counsellor,I have been listening to you for a period of six weeks and I I'm feeling

9562,low_062,counsellor,but you're working now is that right?
9563,low_062,client,i guess i'm working now mmhmm yeah
9564,low_062,counsellor,is ok?
9565,low_062,client,yeah ever since fine at work uh-huh yeah i know what's key i enjoy but obviously it's because i'm feeling a bit i feel as if things are getting on top of me at work a little bit but it's not really i know this noise just that we are feeling okay
9566,low_062,counsellor,you're sleeping well?
9567,low_062,client,I'll wake up harrell in the morning and I don't seem to be able to get back to sleep or go to sleep okay at night. But wake up hell in the morning edge or soon to be able to get back to sleep very quickly okay.
9568,low_062,counsellor,you eating fine concentrations good core memory is good?
9569,low_062,client,Constitution could be a bit better my memory getting older you know my memory to schools a little bit but other than that normal really just feeling just I'm worried about things I'm worried about my daughter she left home and you know worried about all of that and my husband's abroad and you know this online courses drive me and scene but I know that I know that when I'm on for him and when I'm not just feeling so overburdened I'm fine
9570,low_062,counsellor,is that why you're not looking after yourself as well at the moment?
9571,low_062,client,I am looking after myself. I'm eating quite healthily. I just struggle to get sleep. I guess I sleep okay and I wake up in the morning. My mind's going nuts.
9572,low_062,counsellor,and alcohol?
9573,low_062,client,I have a couple of glasses at Wayne at night just helps me get off to sleep
9574,low_062,counsellor,with glasses how much do you mean?
9575,low_062,client,and maybe about mils in a glass that reasonably smallish classes yeah
9576,low_062,counsellor,two of those? yeah okay and you wanting tablets?
9577,low_062,client,yes that helped me the last time and that's what I want
9578,low_062,counsellor,we've no Rini to follow guidelines and recommendations on how they've had just had recently updated guidelines we use things like nice guidelines and stuff and you're describing anxiety symptoms that seem to be related to specific issues and we don't think tablets are the best thing anymore we're there's much more recommendation to big you know talking with professionals having what we call CBT cognitive behavioral therapy working through these issues is probably a better long-term option and is what is firstly recommended and second recommendation we try and avoid especially those types of drugs you're talking about valium because we know they just make addicted to them
9579,low_062,client,ah so what about this did you see cognitive cbt cbt what does that mean
9580,low_062,counsellor,it's a psychologist to talk to you about you how things you do
9581,low_062,client,how long does it take well
9582,low_062,counsellor,it's usually our obsessions in a seminar if you're lucky once a week that week wicked
9583,low_062,client,I don't have time to do I wear long sessions once a week. I'm working full time and I'm doing an online course and I've still got a house to manage. I just would prefer the tablets work for me before. I would prefer that I got.
9584,low_062,counsellor,you don't have anyone any of them left yet still we finished all those you had? two years ago yes yep she took all than one then when I needed them yet and that was fine that was all I needed though you gave me I think tablets that was all I needed just to get me over the hump nope just about - weeks still think be worth having a more in-depth discussion about this to see what would be your best options because I other tablets as well that can be used again there again more preventative it's more to keep these things getting so it doesn't happen again and again and again right and also your ways of coping assume does it
9585,low_062,client,how long is it if you get referred for cbt how long does it take to be seen
9586,low_062,counsellor,it depends a bit on different areas where is it you live just locally here don't you yeah i would have to send a letter and we would get a reply to tell us how long you'd have to wait and i would hope it would be too long because this is one of our prioritized areas and it how long is too long what i should be within the month i would take a month yeah
9587,low_062,client,i could get tablets and be fixed in a month yeah so you're saying i can't get tablets
9588,low_062,counsellor,well i definitely when you give you that many and i really think you'll be worth looking at the other options how about i gave you just a few like a couple to see if that does you a little better than it
9589,low_062,client,and then i have to come back when I'm finished in and go through this whole conversation again
9590,low_062,counsellor,no I think no I think we should refer your straightaway
9591,low_062,client,right so no tablets you've gone from
9592,low_062,counsellor,I'll give you a few tablets. I'll give you a few tablet and we'll refer you because I need you don't have to come back here unless there is a problem.
9593,low_062,client,but you're seeing that a Pharaoh's going to take a month and you're going to give me a few tablets I can i'll be back here next week seen can have some more tablets then
9594,low_062,counsellor,do you think it's going to last that long?
9595,low_062,client,as if it's good like tell that's the last time and it took the tablets to help me get myself sorted out so yes i do i just think this is ridiculous changes are more for changes but it worked what if it works like like oh it's just we know the damage
9596,low_062,counsellor,i can do you affect your driving light over they dictate just as a short bar so it was won by suppose if that's your day I'm saying well I think you know that beam in between we can give you a couple of times now to try for the next few days I'll send a referral today and obviously if you feel so better you can come back but I would hope you wouldn't need to ask okay let just to do check here as well computers reminding me that you ever do you smear as well that we will as well yep you know we have targets we need to read targets yeah so worth getting them done
9597,low_062,client,but I you sure your records are right i'm pretty sure i had last me or less than a year ago
9598,low_062,counsellor,was that somewhere else then? because that might not be recorded here no is good something here
9599,low_062,client,this is my plant assistant single you can ask me about my blood pressure names don't you
9600,low_062,counsellor,that was done we need to do that every three or five years I've got that has been done that's okay and for the smear it's not being recorded here did you get a letter with the result? if you do member we could be good records that way no it's not going to do any harm getting an extra one so make the point with the nurse right the time the okay i'll just write the description
9601,low_062,client,okay thank you sir okay
9602,low_062,counsellor,thank you see you
9603,low_063,client,I'm very well thank you have you seen many repeat prescription and what's up for the real doctor Reducto and that's for my my class cuz I've done with it all of them
9604,low_063,counsellor,right no no no no what when was the last time you got that prescription from us?
9605,low_063,client,although you few miles back
9606,low_063,counsellor,yes I'm surprised did you see the local GP?
9607,low_063,client,yeah could be hmm
9608,low_063,counsellor,you shouldn't have been given a doctor why do you think you need that?
9609,low_063,client,I'm using it for a while this kind of referee well because I've been using rate and it well a little bit wait but it helps. I'm not so happy anymore and I kind of think it's a bit more and still lose weight.
9610,low_063,counsellor,no no no you can't you you can't get that drug anymore I'm afraid no no you're not having that drug anymore and it's been proven that that drug is not good for you and so I'm very surprised that the look and gave it to you but we're not doing it anymore yes but it's not it's not fine it's not good for your heart it's causing heart problems and it's been proven that it's not the most effective way to lose sweet and what what are you doing about your lifestyle? what are you doing about losing weight? other than depending on tablets?
9611,low_063,client,oh okay and change my cooter died kick both ways however Larry's I kind of working chichester really that's doing a bit more stairs and but doesn't much time for you
9612,low_063,counsellor,well it's going to take a bit more than that I think and have you thought about planning in advance? if you work you know taking a packed lunch pre planning your meals and turning to healthy options? because really even diet coke's not good for you you should be replacing that with water
9613,low_063,client,oh yeah we don't get meals we can't have to do it in between and Julie doctor at the hospital we have a good time and we need to kind of just bringing her face yeah lovely often you can to be kind you can't even get food is just like you chocolate or something
9614,low_063,counsellor,yeah but I roll the other doctors overweight no no so clearly you could be improving your lifestyle you could take a wrap and just have it you know you could make a wrap a healthy wrap and take it and just have it instead of reaching for a bar of chocolate because i'll also affect your blood pressure and your sugar levels so and what I think you should maybe do as maybe just have a maybe do a diet e of your lifestyle because well it's a no popping a pill seems like an easy option but really you're going to have to do the hard work this is only going to come if you get in the right headspace and you start looking at your lifestyle looking at your exercise looking at your eating habits looking at the frequency and your magnet you're eating because if you're running about as a doctor you shouldn't beginning we if you if you've got a busy lifestyle you should be losing weight naturally so you're there must be something in your daily routine that's stopping you so you maybe need to look and see if you're a comfort eater or what what your triggers are for food and and get that sorted but you know I'm afraid drugs are no longer the answer C I'll just get one half down to the last few months of my job and then no I know I you know we would all like a magic wand because it makes life easier but I can't do that it's not worth the risk to your heart I can't I can't do that you just need to take a long hard look at yourself and what you're doing and if you want help with that we do have pamphlets you know have you thought about and you know doing some exercise that you feel more energized
9615,low_063,client,oh I've not lack of energy around all day that's not a problem it's just really time I'm getting time to do something else moment it's just work asleep I'm afraid mm-hmm not much to be there it's just wreck yeah
9616,low_063,counsellor,so you need to put some thought into if you is that is your lifestyle you're going to have to put some thought into when you can devote some time to looking after yourself
9617,low_063,client,I think I'll be able to do as I finish this job but I just need something now mm-hmm because otherwise I can't really afford to buy new clothes and it was it was keeping me kid
9618,low_063,counsellor,so are you putting on weight or have you been losing the weight?
9619,low_063,client,let's think you can be steady and speak
9620,low_063,counsellor,so you've not you've not been losing weight with it? that's being okay yeah I probably should put on weight that's been using it yeah so you can't you know it's good that you're standing still but it's not good that you're not losing weight especially if you're on the drugs so clearly the drug wasn't the answer for you and really the only answer for you as its lifestyle changes and you know look at your colleagues and are they what are they eating and adopt some of their policy Asian was there eating on the hoof they must there must be some of your colleagues that are eating healthy options that you could you could take a flask of soup you know I'm soup salads wraps fruit and veg you know that's that's the only way is the hard way but it's the only way yeah
9621,low_063,client,I can't see me doing that that's a problem. It's sleeping where no time to give the shelves no time to do preparation. That this just like so happy equals there and if we get time to go to the cantinas you just okay. Just something don't seem to be very many healthy options and if they're either you be gone by the time we get there.
9622,low_063,counsellor,that's why I think you need to control of it yourself by planning and making sure that you have healthy options available because otherwise you're just going to stay in a vicious cycle and and you know drugs we would all like a drug to make things easy for us but I'm afraid easy it's not the option it's going to be a hard slog but I think I think you'll find that once you start if you get yourself into the right headspace once you start then you will have a sense of achievement and the weight will start to lose it you will start losing the weight because if you're that energetic in your job you're obviously doing enough activity so it has to be down to the diet
9623,low_063,client,is there nothing you can do to help
9624,low_063,counsellor,but why don't you make a diary of everything that you eat? because you might not realize I had you might be grazing and not realizing it so why don't you keep a food diary and come back and see me and two weeks time can you keep a diet have you got k cubed I you for two weeks?
9625,low_063,client,yeah I think I should give it yeah if you
9626,low_063,counsellor,if you write down everything that you eat and any extra activity other than running a boat in your jobs that you do and we'll look at that and where you now before you go and will we when you come back and then we'll see if you can start making a conscious effort and then we'll maybe set you down with a dietician set you up with an appointment with the dietitian to get some nutritional advice but I think you need to start preparing yourself mentally and to be in the right headspace to make this work for you because if you're not in the right frame of mind if you're doing it grudgingly then you're not going to lose weight
9627,low_063,client,okay thank you
9628,low_064,client,hello Doctor okay
9629,low_064,counsellor,how can I help you t well
9630,low_064,client,I would like a repeat prescription please for my diet drugs just confirm for me your name again Laura Smith up like yes yes I brought you
9631,low_064,counsellor,Reducto I think that's what it was colleges and reduct I'll actually is no longer recommended and for usin in we lost weight control have you been getting on with it?
9632,low_064,client,and I know they're not losing weight but I'm not putting it on and just give me another one then I'm not fussy which makers I am
9633,low_064,counsellor,you can buy em over the counter Laura doors lower doors tablets eat so you don't need a prescription for them anymore
9634,low_064,client,well I've know that my prescription cause my prescriptions fee and I think I've got a Rachel prescription and no
9635,low_064,counsellor,I'm sorry we can't prescribe orlistat
9636,low_064,client,why and
9637,low_064,counsellor,because it's over-the-counter medicines right
9638,low_064,client,so just give me the equivalent and counter is great
9639,low_064,counsellor,we can't we can't prescribe anything reductil was the one that was on I was prescription on the medicine and we can no longer prescribe that guidance recommends that we no longer prescribe that for people because it's actually shown to increase the cardiovascular risk and actually I noticed from your last visit that your blood pressure was a little bit high I don't think you should be taking any medicines because the bottom line is actually from what you're telling me is it's not helping you to lose weight it's helping you to maintain your read and maintaining your weight should be something that you do through diet and exercise anyway this is artificially maintaining your weight
9640,low_064,client,find that really hard just keep piling on the pounds until I started a dragon you know I really would like it are you sure that it's yet dangerous because yes not that long ago that happen well
9641,low_064,counsellor,it has actually been recent gaiden so in the last month or so after six weeks tips sometimes tease a bit to filter through but we've been told unequivocally that we're not allowed to prescribe this anymore your prescription to farm since they won't fill it and you really do need to be joining Weight Watchers there's been an article there's been an article in the in the BMG just a couple of weeks ago that shows are actually joining a group a Weight Watchers group or the equivalent is much more effective long-term well I'm sorry there's no choice yeah it's a much lower it's much more it because it's less there's less and drug in it it's less effective but then consequently it's also less dangerous so you can buy them orlistat and or you can join Weight Watchers you actually
9642,low_064,client,I don't think you're thinking about how stressed I am about my week I'm sorry it's not you I know I know and
9643,low_064,counsellor,I can appreciate that. What it's your diet and exercise that's the important thing. You need to get yourself sorted out. I don't eat them all well. I think you might find that you possibly are eating more than you think. And if you join Weight Watchers or equivalent slimming world etc then you possibly would be encouraged to do a food diet e. And you might find that you're eating more than you. There's nothing more I can do for you. We cannot prescribe reductil anymore. The recommendation is join a Weight Watchers group or Slimming World Group and just modify your diet and increase your exercise. That is the only way that you are going to lose weight.
9644,low_064,client,well I'm not really happy with that approach I'm really sorry that I was unable to help you because there must be somebody else in here that has got more and understanding approach to weight loss and telling me to join Weight Watchers
9645,low_064,counsellor,well that is the recommendation that's the guidelines if you're very welcome to go and make an appointment with another doctor but you will get the same message from them as you're getting from me and I'm uh sorry if I peered unsympathetic however the bottom line is diet and exercise is what you need to do in order to lose weight and to maintain your weight
9646,low_064,client,but I am eating what I've always it's just know that I'm getting little age and piling on pounds so
9647,low_064,counsellor,if you're on if you're on a stool that you've always done then you're always going to get what you get so if you already eat and you've already used to be fat but the only reason that you're maintaining your weight is because of the deductr
9648,low_064,client,if you would let me finish I've only started to get fat since I had the menopause so are you telling me that because I've had the menopause I'm not allowed to eat a normal amount of food
9649,low_064,counsellor,no I'm saying that you need to be looking at your whole lifestyle which is dying exercise I'm really sorry that I'm unable to help you today please feel free to make an appointment with another GP
9650,low_064,client,well i'll be taking this further because i'm not happy i'm not satisfied with this ok thank you
9651,low_064,counsellor,thank you
9652,low_065,counsellor,okay so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aidan that should help with the ear infection but in looking through this chart I mean it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so that's really a big problem
9653,low_065,client,yeah it's pretty stressful for both of us it gets really upset
9654,low_065,counsellor,well one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections and kids is actually smoke exposure are you smoking?
9655,low_065,client,yeah I yeah I do smoke but I don't smoke around him I try really hard not to smoke around him
9656,low_065,counsellor,well the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke and so what can you tell me about that?
9657,low_065,client,I I don't know I mean I try really hard not to smoke around him I don't smoke in the car when he's home I go outside to smoke I just I mean I know it's bad and I know it's bad for him so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard
9658,low_065,counsellor,"I really need you to quit smoking both for your health and for Aidan. Did you know smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections? It could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities like dental cavities, behavior problems, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. You want him to grow up to be a smoker?"
9659,low_065,client,no but I don't smoke I'm I I I've thought about quitting but it's just it's really hard so I just don't know how to do it
9660,low_065,counsellor,well now is the time to quit it's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking not only for him like I said but also for you you're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer for emphysema for oral cancers for heart disease for all kinds
9661,low_065,client,I know I know. I've heard people have told me before. I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's so hard.
9662,low_065,counsellor,well there's all kinds of things you can use now it's not as hard as it used to be you can use nicotine replacement there's patches there's lozenges there's gum there's the inhaler there's nasal spray we can talk about medications you can try chantix you can try zyban there's quit smoking groups you can go to there's hotlines you can talk
9663,low_065,client,don't have times
9664,low_065,counsellor,no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit this is really important
9665,low_065,client,"I understand that. I know it is. I mean everybody has problems right? It's just really, it's really really hard."
9666,low_065,counsellor,well what can be more important to you than the health of your child?
9667,low_065,client,I don't know
9668,low_065,counsellor,I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking this is really important
9669,low_065,client,oh I'll go look at all those things and I'll find I guess I'll try to find something and I'll talk to my doctor about it
9670,low_065,counsellor,okay well I think you really need to think about this seriously it like I said it's really putting yourself and your child in danger
9671,low_065,client,okay whatever
9672,low_065,counsellor,okay okay
9673,low_066,client,yeah um I'm Michelle
9674,low_066,counsellor,okay so i'll be your additional therapist today and the doctor recently told you the UH pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news so that I can better help
9675,low_066,client,um well I mean I wasn't really expecting this it really caught me off guard and I know what I eat isn't always the healthiest you know um but I didn't think things were this bad I mean my life is pretty hectic so I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself so yeah
9676,low_066,counsellor,so you were pretty shocked I'm sensing you might be quite scared too
9677,low_066,client,yeah I'm a little scared but more worried than anything I mean my career is really important to me and I don't really want my pre-diabetes tummy down and um I don't really want to have to take medication you know as who does I'm absolutely terrified of needles so I don't want to be pricking myself all the time and then watching what I eat and counting car I dress and everything it just sounds like a whole lot of hassle that I don't have time for it you know
9678,low_066,counsellor,you feel like having diabetes will cause some unfortunate lifestyle changes what I'm hearing says you don't want your bad health to affect the way to affect your career
9679,low_066,client,mm-hmm basically I guess FF is so much a mark that I've kind of gotten to take care of myself and um I guess I'm really shooting myself in the foot because that's what's cosmic pre-diabetes you know um
9680,low_066,counsellor,so you feel like you're just not giving the attention your body really deserves
9681,low_066,client,yeah and honestly haven't been this way like when I took this job I guess that's when my health started spiraling downwards and I don't know I guess that's when I kind of noticed things were kind of off as far as my health goes so
9682,low_066,counsellor,can you tell me a little bit more about what you do?
9683,low_066,client,um well I'm an ESL teacher so I teach English to foreign students and adults I work in a community center close by but I also spend a lot of my days traveling it's just part of the job so I eat out often and always on the go and it makes following a healthy diet and lifestyle pretty difficult and and I mean I know exercise and diet are important I guess I honestly could work out at the gym at the hotels but they aren't always available you know
9684,low_066,counsellor,okay so you recognize the importance of exercise
9685,low_066,client,yeah I do um but when i get that free time i just want to veg out you know you don't really want to have to come back and go to the gym you know so that's part of it too
9686,low_066,counsellor,so yeah I think that you should make exercise a part of your life um exercise is huge and managing your diabetes if you're overweight it can help you lose weight exercise can also help with your blood sugar and it can also reduce your stress levels
9687,low_066,client,um well I guess I mean it could be a way for me to avoid getting diabetes and yes taking medication
9688,low_066,counsellor,I think yeah I think exercise is the right step for you to stop the progression of your diabetes um so how many days a week do you think you can exercise?
9689,low_066,client,um I mean right now I just want to say one because you know when I travel I'm not really sure if there's ever going to be anything available and um I don't know I'd like I don't even like exercise in words so it would be a big step a big change for me
9690,low_066,counsellor,can you make it a goal to exercise three to four times a week? I need you to do it more than just one day
9691,low_066,client,um I mean that might just be a little too much for me honestly I mean maybe when I'm stuck in a hotel and they have a gym i'm just unsure as whether i can commit to doing that much because I mean I don't want to buy gym membership here because i'm not home enough to use it and I feel like it would just be a waste of money no
9692,low_066,counsellor,I really think that making exercise an important part of your life is crucial for you.
9693,low_066,client,yeah but I mean I just I don't know it's just difficult for me you know like I said I don't enjoy it to begin with so it would be a really big step
9694,low_066,counsellor,I'll tell you what you should do I'll give you the name of my trainer just come in mention my name and he'll take care of you um his name is George this is this hot Italian guy um he really makes working out a walk in the park so you'll go see him
9695,low_066,client,I mean maybe that might be something still don't know
9696,low_066,counsellor,this will be great for you I'm being physically active is an essential part in the treatment of diabetes it will lower your blood sugar um body fat your body fat will decrease and you'll really feel so much better
9697,low_066,client,yeah I mean like I said we'll see
9698,low_066,counsellor,well thanks for coming in today um I feel very confident about this exercise thing that will be successful next time you come in we'll look at the progress you made and it kind of increased the number of times that you're exercising a day
9699,low_066,client,yeah I'll see you next time
9700,low_066,counsellor,okay bye thank you
9701,low_067,client,yeah my doctor said he called something in okay
9702,low_067,counsellor,it looks like cholesterol Staten do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?
9703,low_067,client,no not really
9704,low_067,counsellor,well you just take it once a day did he tell you what side effects to expect?
9705,low_067,client,no well some of the
9706,low_067,counsellor,common ones are nausea vomiting headache there's some severe ones like dermatomyositis liver failure lupus rhabdomyolysis hemorrhagic cerebral infarction if you have any of those just call your doctor
9707,low_067,client,okay um why am I taking this medication?
9708,low_067,counsellor,it's for your disk lipid e mia oh yeah just one tablet a day do you have any questions for me?
9709,low_067,client,no I guess not
9710,low_067,counsellor,all right great have a good day hello kaleigh I'm Lori the pharmacist here at bulldog pharmacy I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol Staten called in by dr. Ferris today I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me? I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it and if you have any questions?
9711,low_067,client,sure I'm just getting a few groceries
9712,low_067,counsellor,okay what did the doctor tell you cholesterol sadness for?
9713,low_067,client,well he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol and that I should start taking this
9714,low_067,counsellor,he's right this medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke how did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?
9715,low_067,client,you didn't really tell me you just phoned it in
9716,low_067,counsellor,okay well you're going to take one tablet of cholesteryl sent in twenty one time a day by mouth and you can take that with or without food when do you normally take your medications?
9717,low_067,client,well I take all my other medications right before I go to bed so I guess I could take it then
9718,low_067,counsellor,okay that's perfect because cholesterol stenton works best if it's taken at night though you can take it anytime of the day and you should take it every single day it's important to keep that up where do you store your medications?
9719,low_067,client,"I store my medications in my nightstand right by my bed. All right, do you have any children in your home? No."
9720,low_067,counsellor,okay well then that sounds like a perfect location for you medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture what did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?
9721,low_067,client,he didn't mention anything about that
9722,low_067,counsellor,"All right, well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications and even over-the-counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with Cholesterol Stan. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication. Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?"
9723,low_067,client,sure I'm just going to take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications and I guess I'll switch to orange juice and if I notice any muscle pain that is severe I'll call dr. Ferris right away
9724,low_067,counsellor,great Kaylee I know we went over a lot today what other questions do you have for me
9725,low_067,client,I think you answered all my questions thank you fantastic
9726,low_067,counsellor,all right well here's your prescription I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every at the same time every month and if you have any other questions later our phone numbers right here on the bottle and you can call me at any time thanks so much have a great day
9727,low_068,client,hi um I guess I want to talk about the stress see us where we left off last time and how is this still building
9728,low_068,counsellor,still there
9729,low_068,client,it's still there I feel like I haven't I've been able to deal with it if no we've been able to identify I haven't been able to make any significant change
9730,low_068,counsellor,you've not be able to deal with it or make any significant change
9731,low_068,client,no I tried try different things I've flooded force myself to get around it by forcing myself into new work
9732,low_068,counsellor,mm-hmm
9733,low_068,client,but it doesn't seem to happen I've found myself sitting to the computer I've got my books I'm open I get Word document up I know I should be there but I have no motivation whatsoever to do it
9734,low_068,counsellor,now you you've been making efforts in to try and forcing yourself to do the work you set out the things needed to be done the computer the software and the box but then like you wait for something to happen
9735,low_068,client,hmm yeah like this you guys I sit there feeling frustrated as I'm at it yeah that I I can't get the work done and I know that if if it keeps going how it is at the moment I keep going how I am at the moment I'm not going I I'm not going to get my work and I'm not going to do work and that means failing University
9736,low_068,counsellor,you'll be fairly University
9737,low_068,client,which ends up let me give you having to give up and go home and I know that's not why one I definitely want to be here but I just can't seem to focus on my work
9738,low_068,counsellor,so you kind of want to be here because it's not going home where you don't want to return to and staying here has consequences in that you're required to work required to do specific tasks specific job specific projects I get that something gets in the way of you working
9739,low_068,client,yeah yeah this doesn't help well Holmes I'm still a myth missing lectures I'm sleeping in in the mornings again have no motivation to get up in the morning roll over just turn off my alarm clock just don't seem to be bothered about it
9740,low_068,counsellor,so it's not just not being able to do the work there's also something of not going in two lectures to university maybe not getting any more work
9741,low_068,client,yeah Hey hmm I can see it all building up and I know this is a deadline just coming and if I don't get the work done then don't think about that
9742,low_068,counsellor,there's a consequence of getting not getting the work done okay where I'm afraid that we're out of time for now so we need to stop
9743,low_069,client,I'm sorry but are you the pharmacist I just had a question about citalopram
9744,low_069,counsellor,yeah I'm the pharmacist on duty citalopram okay it's an antidepressant and it comes in and milligram strength it's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about hours for side effects there are sexual side effects heart side effects and stomachs side effects
9745,low_069,client,okay but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine
9746,low_069,counsellor,oh um yeah I think that should be fine
9747,low_069,client,okay thanks for that I have an appointment to run to
9748,low_069,counsellor,alright thanks call me anytime
9749,low_070,client,hi I need to get this new prescription filled
9750,low_070,counsellor,you've been here before?
9751,low_070,client,no I haven't
9752,low_070,counsellor,okay um so so this is a new prescription?
9753,low_070,client,yeah it's a new another blood pressure medication Marty and one I just went to see my doctor earlier I was hoping he told me I could stop it because I I cut my salt intake I started going to the gym regularly but no instead now he says I need a second one I'm not even sure if the first one worked
9754,low_070,counsellor,no problem I'm just going to ask you a few other questions before I fill this prescription okay do you have any allergies no any medical conditions?
9755,low_070,client,just acid reflux and high blood pressure and
9756,low_070,counsellor,any other medications you're taking?
9757,low_070,client,yeah well I i said i'm already on a blood pressure medication i take hydrochlorothiazide i'm already on milligrams in the morning and that's when I was hoping that I could stop but I have to keep taking that one and i'm also on pan to lock one taladon
9758,low_070,counsellor,okay well let me just counsel you on this medication
9759,low_071,counsellor,okay my name's Laura I'm the pharmacist here let me just look you up in the computer
9760,low_071,client,sure
9761,low_071,counsellor,your name?
9762,low_071,client,Jessica fields
9763,low_071,counsellor,and your date of birth?
9764,low_071,client,April twenty-eighth
9765,low_071,counsellor,okay a few right here it looks like you haven't had your insulin refilled in a couple of months have you been using it?
9766,low_071,client,oh um yes so I've been using it but it hurts when I inject it um so I haven't been using it every day I think I was supposed to use it every day but every two or three days I've been using
9767,low_071,counsellor,it it's really important that you use your insulin exactly as prescribed it's really dangerous to let your blood Sugar's run high. what have they been when you test them?
9768,low_071,client,um well anytime that I test it if it's about i use it i use Manson so usually don't let it get higher than that
9769,low_071,counsellor,is pretty high do you know what the risks are associated with letting your blood Sugar's run high like that?
9770,low_071,client,no
9771,low_071,counsellor,so they can be very serious that can even lead to things like blindness you can get a really bad infection in your foot and maybe have to lose it I don't want that to happen to you and I'm sure you don't either no it's really important that you take your infant exactly as prescribed I know it hurts but just do it for me do it for yourself
9772,low_072,client,"Actually he told me it might stop my son’s growth, my son really wants to be an athlete, so I’m just really concerned that it might affect his growth in some way."
9773,low_072,counsellor,"Okay so I wouldn’t worry about that. If you want him to be an athlete, it’s probably more important to worry about him breathing clearly than it is to worry about his height."
9774,low_073,client,Tylenol?
9775,low_073,counsellor,There are Tylenol in the Percocet and you can reach a limit that actually damage your liver so there's some concerns there. Also the opiates that you are taking are above what we call the watchful though so that can actually increase your risk of dying relating to take an opioid that much overtime.
9776,low_073,client,"But that’s all prescribed by my doctor, I’m sure he would know that. I’m above this watchful dose, I’m taking too much Tylenol. It should be fine. What’s the issue with having too much Opioid, I take what I need."
9777,low_073,counsellor,"well he should know, but he’s new, so maybe he doesn’t know. Anyways he send you to us and we are really the experts in the area, so we can make all these recommendations and he can work with you to carry this out. So first of all we are gonna take down your dose of Oxycodone. Second of all, we need to relook at the medications you are on firstly. All these different medications interrupt with each other."
9778,low_073,client,What do you mean sleep medication? I’m here just for the pain assessment.
9779,low_073,counsellor,"So it’s just all this medication tie together. You don’t have to worry about anything, we are gonna be making recommendations to take care of everything. But to be honest, I can even believe that you are still awake while you are here. Like this is probably snowing you while you don’t realize. Did you drive here?"
9780,low_073,client,I took the TTC but like I made it on to the TCC and I’m talking to you and I’m clearly not snowed. My sleeping medication is what I need to sleep. This is the pain assessment you are doing? I just don’t know why you are touching my sleeping meds. Those are fine.
9781,low_073,counsellor,"It’s really hard to explain, it’s really complex. But trust me, we are going to make the recommendation, and you just need to follow it step by step. Everything should be fine."
9782,low_074,client,hi
9783,low_074,counsellor,so yeah I was looking over your survey that you filled out for like that you're presently not using a kind of birth control particularly condoms
9784,low_074,client,yeah I'm gonna use those
9785,low_074,counsellor,okay so can you tell me tell me why you don't use condoms
9786,low_074,client,well I've heard from other people that they don't do much and I don't really want to go out and buy them when they're not going to be that important to me or really do anything for me
9787,low_074,counsellor,so Chris did you know that condoms are really kind of the best way for males to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections to prevent you know males from becoming teen fathers and also to prevent things like HIV did you know that those are some things that condoms do for you not specifically
9788,low_074,client,I mean I know that they're supposed to help avoiding those things by a little bit but okay I can avoid those on my own
9789,low_074,counsellor,oh okay um well you know the statistics of teen pregnancy are really high and a lot of the reason is because you know people like yourself aren't using condoms to protect themselves I also want to tell you that condoms are really easy to get you know you can get them at your health departments you can buy them at any pharmacy it's really easy to do you can carry them in your backpack you know they're small packages you can put them in your pocket you can keep them in your car so they're really really easy to use they're really really effective and you know there's really no reason why someone like yourself shouldn't be using condoms if you're going to choose to be sexually active are you yourself ready to be a teen father is that something that you're looking to do
9790,low_074,client,no
9791,low_074,counsellor,okay okay well I really need you to commit to using condoms because it sounds like you you know aren't ready to be a teen father I'm assuming you don't want any of these infections that are very prevalent so I really need you to tell me today that you're going to you know try this out and make a commitment to change and become a healthier person can you do that I mean I've got real items here reckon I can give you one to take with you is that that's what you want
9792,low_074,client,okay great okay thank you
9793,low_075,client,well it was raining I didn't wear my science fair project a get wet I knew my parents weren't
9794,low_075,counsellor,"Science fair project or not, don't you know what happens when someone drives under the influence of marijuana or alcohol? It's bad. They can wreck the car. You can lose your life. I thought you were smart. You're taking AP classes. You want to get into Ivy League school. This is not the way you do that."
9795,low_075,client,it really wasn't that big of a deal
9796,low_075,counsellor,it's a big deal you can't drink either you're the drinking age is I think you know that you could get into an auto crash I just want you to hear this I don't tolerate as a doctor drinking or driving with somebody who's under the influence and if you do it again I'm going to tell your parents
9797,low_076,client,k.
9798,low_076,counsellor,Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?
9799,low_076,client,"Not really, I haven’t been stressed, and I have a steady job. You know these days I’m really glad I have a job, I’m really happy that I’m working."
9800,low_076,counsellor,I would also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure. Do you smoke at all?
9801,low_076,client,"No I don’t smoke. I smoke as a young adult, quit year ago, I went cold turkey, proud of that, haven’t really thought about smoking."
9802,low_076,counsellor,Do you drink alcohol and including beer or wine?
9803,low_076,client,"I do drink beer, I drink  or  times on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe  or   Cancel me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure."
9804,low_076,counsellor,I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about to drinks per week. It’s definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure.
9805,low_076,client,"Well my pressure has been high for years,"
9806,low_076,counsellor,Well according to your chart your blood pressure has gone up since July and you said that you've been drinking more recently so do you see the connection there.
9807,low_076,client,Maybe a little bit
9808,low_076,counsellor,"Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So long with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver. Would you need to keep in mind? So your liver has several different roles in your body. For acid, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body and also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up. And overtime, your liver won't be able to work as well. How about the use of other drugs like cocaine, hyrewen, marijuana?"
9809,low_076,client,"I don’t use marijuana cocaine, and I’ve never thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school, years ago or so, I smoked weed, once I got out of school, I haven’t used that at all."
9810,low_076,counsellor,Have you ever used any prescription medications they weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?
9811,low_076,client,"No I don’t really like the idea of taking pills, as a matter of fact, a couple years ago, I had this jaw surgery, they give me the prescription of … I took one, maybe felt wired, they still sit in the medicine cabin."
9812,low_076,counsellor,"Ok, it sounds to me that the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health."
9813,low_076,client,I guess I’ll try.
9814,low_076,counsellor,And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now will recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this.
9815,low_077,client,no I would bum cigarettes in college but I was never a smoker
9816,low_077,counsellor,okay how about in the last year
9817,low_077,client,no not really anything
9818,low_077,counsellor,okay and how often do you have a drink containing alcohol
9819,low_077,client,a few times a week Wednesday's I'll go to a happy hour and have about two or three and then um Thursday's seven seven or eight Friday's probably just a couple glasses of wine with dinner but Saturday's are a bigger night and I would probably have a few drinks before I went to the bar and then have or at when when I was out so
9820,low_077,counsellor,okay so it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day so maybe around drinks a week
9821,low_077,client,I guess it sounds like a lot when you say look at but yeah
9822,low_077,counsellor,okay do you use any street drugs like any marijuana cocaine heroin
9823,low_077,client,no I I spoke weed in college but just a little bit I wasn't a regular smoker
9824,low_077,counsellor,do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you or ever use your own prescriptions in a way in which they were not prescribed okay so you know as we said before you're drinking it sounds like you're drinking about drinks a week over the course of a few days and I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day so you're doing more than that right now and when you drink more than this amount it puts you at risk for a number of things
9825,low_077,client,okay
9826,low_077,counsellor,things like greater risk of injury damage to different parts of your body just a bunch of different problems and so I'm going to recommend that you cut down to cut down that amount to the recommended limit again that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than in a given day do you think you could do that would that be a good goal for you
9827,low_077,client,that's a lot to change I don't know
9828,low_077,counsellor,yeah I know that making changes isn't always easy but when you more than what's recommended it creates problems you know you said you hurt your ankle and came out of the bar this time
9829,low_077,client,I mean the stairs were really steep so yeah
9830,low_077,counsellor,well it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol you know it can actually affect your balance and stability so really you know for where you are right now you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended and you know I want you to be healthy and I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else so I'm really going to recommend that you try to cut down to that amount so do you think you could do that cut down to no more than three drinks in a given day
9831,low_077,client,where are these limits from an older population because I drink just as much as my friends do I mean everybody drinks like I drank I'm not even the biggest drinker in my group so I'm pretty middle of the road
9832,low_077,counsellor,so it sounds like you know the amount you drink is pretty normal amongst the people you typically drink with but these limits are they're actually recommended for all adults and studies have shown that when you drink more than this it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about so you know why do you think you drink the amount you drink
9833,low_077,client,I don't know that's what we do this is how we have fun I guess it is fun
9834,low_077,counsellor,well I think it can still have fun with in these amounts so that's what I'm going to recommend I think this is a really good goal and hopefully we won't see any more injuries okay so why don't you try that
9835,low_077,client,okay
9836,low_077,counsellor,all right thank you so much
9837,low_078,counsellor,hi I'm horse Berger I work in the clinic I know you're here to pick up a prescription today I noticed that we noticed some your records that you've been coming in and getting Sarah's rescue rescue inhaler for her asthma quite frequently and you haven't got her chronic inhaler for quite some time now I also know she's been in the emergency room several times this year is can you tell me what's going on there
9838,low_078,client,well I did a research on the chronic inhaler and I saw that there were steroids in it and I do not want my daughter taking steroids I read about all the side effects of steroids and all the potential health problems I don't want her taking them and I just want to tell you right up front I do not want to hear anything about the fact that I do smoke I smoke outside I smoke away from her I do not ever do it around her so I do not want to hear about that
9839,low_078,counsellor,well III need to tell you that the the medicine that she's taking the chronic inhaler which is really essential to controlling her asthma does is not a steroid like you're thinking it's it's much safer it's very safe she and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control and I also want to tell you that your smoking does affect her asthma even if even if it's outside it gets on her clothes and to be honest I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway but if you want to keep her out of the emergency room she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day and you need to watch your smoking
9840,low_078,client,okay I am NOT going to allow her to take any kind of steroid I am NOT going to allow that to happen she's my daughter she's my responsibility and I'm not going to allow that to happen and I absolutely make sure that the smoking does not affect her
9841,low_078,counsellor,okay I you know I don't want to argue with you about this I I know that if you you died if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her to get her asthma under control and the smoke and your clothes and smoking flares her asthma so she really needs to use that chronic inhaler and you really need to think about quitting smoking fine
9842,low_078,client,I'm in a really big hurry I need to get those prescriptions filled as soon as possible please
9843,low_078,counsellor,okay well I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about it using that chronic hailer and i hope you consider quitting smoking
9844,low_078,client,fine I just need to get my prescriptions
9845,low_078,counsellor,good
9846,low_079,counsellor,"and you’ve been talking about that a lot lately, So I really feel like this is something you need to do soon, because a lot of time there’s just a lot of talk, but there’s no action. And if you really want to see results, I guess it’s something that needs to be done and stop being lazy about it and just do it."
9847,low_079,client,Well I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it I think it's just that I have a busy schedule yeah I just need to find the time to do it and yes I might be lacking a little bit of motivation but I think it's more time again trying to fit it in.
9848,low_079,counsellor,"and it sounds like a lot of excuses to me, and you have shared with me before that you do have a gym membership so that’s just something you need to fit in your schedule. So for you to see results you want, my guess is that you need to go about to times a week and really fit in that hour workout on a daily basis."
9849,low_079,client,But it is part of the problem is that I don't have to times a week to do it or an hour or even I mean hours the long time cuz if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there time there time back I mean it's not just an hour it's the two hours realistically and.
9850,low_079,counsellor,"and it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in and if it’s gonna take you two hours it’s gonna take you two hours. And again, if you want the results you need to start and you need to start now."
9851,low_079,client,"well, Okay.."
9852,low_079,counsellor,"I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow, and I'm hoping that you are going to be able to tell me that you went to the gym."
9853,low_080,client,uh yeah I just got off work and apparently they're going smoke-free so I'm I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and they say they don't work very well I don't really want to quit smoking I just need somebody to get me through the day
9854,low_080,counsellor,so you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking
9855,low_080,client,maybe like that during the day nicotine replacement is that I mean do y'all have anything like that
9856,low_080,counsellor,we don't really recommend that the ideas you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either
9857,low_080,client,well I don't really want to quit I mean I like smoking I'll go like after work they have a beer with my friends not smoke cigarettes I mean it's not really a big deal cigarettes aren't that bad I mean I know that the it's popular to say that smoking is bad for you but you know I like it so I'm gonna keep doing it
9858,low_080,counsellor,okay well smoking really is really bad for you you know it causes things like lung cancer emphysema heart disease
9859,low_080,client,yeah okay oh well what are my options you know I assuming that I'm right what are my options
9860,low_080,counsellor,well to be honest with you you mentioned the patch I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you in order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now
9861,low_080,client,I mean I spent barely a pack a day. I mean I probably smoked about five or six years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes. But it's sort of hard to get through the day work.
9862,low_080,counsellor,okay well we actually considered cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement
9863,low_080,client,sounds good to me the more nicotine the better is there like gum or something I could chew it like while I'm in the office that sounds pretty great
9864,low_080,counsellor,I mean do you have there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings and probably the gum would be the best option for you it's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however the gum is something you use just when you have a craving
9865,low_080,client,oh okay well where's that
9866,low_080,counsellor,well we have that here but again the the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking
9867,low_080,client,well I'm probably not gonna buy anything today I just came by to see what my options are I think thanks for the input I mean do you everything else do me other well advice for me
9868,low_080,counsellor,"Aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge. That would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd want to use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement. But again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke."
9869,low_080,client,oh okay well thanks i mean i guess that helps a little bit oh maybe i'll be back later Thanks okay
9870,low_081,client,yeah you again yeah so looking forward to this
9871,low_081,counsellor,so how you been doing
9872,low_081,client,yeah I've been living life now just don't stay why I do best
9873,low_081,counsellor,so any particular reason why you're here I had called you into several meetings haven't seen you
9874,low_081,client,I don't know you tell me
9875,low_081,counsellor,it wouldn't happen to be about the eviction notice
9876,low_081,client,nothing that concerned isn't concern you
9877,low_081,counsellor,it does concern me I want to help you our council told me that you're being evicted in three days
9878,low_081,client,yeah I am I'm gonna get out of our house okay I'm apartment just there's going to kick me out I have no one in society yeah been doing that
9879,low_081,counsellor,it would be possible to stay in your apartment if you paid your rent
9880,low_081,client,yeah well try my phone bills and everything else is piling up in my in the corridor I don't know what to do
9881,low_081,counsellor,if you open them up and pay them it would help
9882,low_081,client,yes yes I know but there's so many there's too many to do to do at the same time maybe just Weidman
9883,low_081,counsellor,I really tried to help you on this several times yeah
9884,low_081,client,alright aren't that many times before
9885,low_081,counsellor,what's happened I mean you were doing so great we got out of rehab you had everything under control you were showing up to the meetings I knew what was happening yeah well I don't know
9886,low_081,client,I've tried to do my best. I was I really am like living life the way I know how to live it and that's it. I mean like yeah I'm sorry that I like you know spending art spending it on the drugs and everything but you know.
9887,low_081,counsellor,you're spending it on drugs
9888,low_081,client,I mean I'm not spending on drugs I'm just saying an example you know like yeah
9889,low_081,counsellor,are you on drugs again
9890,low_081,client,no I don't know I'm just so confused right now
9891,low_081,counsellor,listen I really want to help you I want to help you I really try to help you I don't in your shoes once yeah I really want to help you
9892,low_081,client,sure for that
9893,low_081,counsellor,I don't want to see you on the streets. None of us want to see you on the streets prostituting yourself because you need dope. You were doing so well. Yeah well.
9894,low_081,client,something I can do a new society that will make me fit in
9895,low_081,counsellor,I really wish you had come to me sooner I really really want to help you on this yeah
9896,low_081,client,yeah I heard that million times for my a million different people
9897,low_081,counsellor,I know I mean I know you've been in rehab several times. I was myself until it worked. But it worked eventually. And I really really think the same can happen for you. Really yeah.
9898,low_081,client,so and what should I do now then see have any advice
9899,low_081,counsellor,I want to help you up it would be great if we could start off by actually seeing you at these meetings
9900,low_081,client,yeah well I just think it's so funny how society just wants to mold me and make me what they want to be like a little box and here's a little person in a box surrounded by people and different stakeholders never want to help me I've just I've had enough I want to live the way I want to live and not be mold molded to just fit in it's not fair
9901,low_081,counsellor,I really want to help you out on this
9902,low_081,client,yeah all right sure you
9903,low_082,counsellor,your alcohol level was clearly you had more than a few beers now how much do you really drink each day
9904,low_082,client,look I had a few beers with some friends of mine after work what's the big deal everybody does I mean I I I work hard and having a couple of beers helps me relax after after a hard day it's time I got a little careless it's all just so it's not make a big deal out of nothing just finish sewing me up so I can get out of here
9905,low_082,counsellor,look I'm an ER doc and I I think I know when somebody's an alcoholic and I think you have a serious drinking problem you better straighten it out now you can get out of here as soon as I stitch you up but in the future do not drink and drive have some sense I mean next time you might not be so lucky
9906,low_083,client,that's great
9907,low_083,counsellor,however I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth actually if you look up here a roof of your mouth I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user so I'm just wondering what's going on
9908,low_083,client,I don't smoke cigarettes
9909,low_083,counsellor,okay well as I said there's a lot of irritation in particular like I was mentioning up here in the roof of your mouth it's turned really deathly white colored and there's little red spots and you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health it's called nicotinic stomatitis and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco so maybe you're not smoking cigarettes are you smoking a pipe or cigars or is there something else they will be contributing to this because I don't know what else might be causing it
9910,low_083,client,well the only thing I've never smoked cigarettes ever but when when I go out with my friends we like to go to you know we'd like to go out to lounges and and you know sometimes there are those those nice young men that gift you different sorts of things and we got some of those mini cigars that swisher Sweets they come on peach and and grape and and you know that's the only time that really you know I've ever really used anything that that's got to pack Oh in it okay
9911,low_083,counsellor,so I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruit flavored people think they're okay those are really bad for you did you know that
9912,low_083,client,really bad but they're just little mini little cute little girly cigars
9913,low_083,counsellor,right there still cigars and there's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer oral cancer emphysema all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes
9914,low_083,client,boy only if it were just to relax I mean it's not like it's something that I would smoke or cigarettes a day I mean I only do it when we go out uh-huh
9915,low_083,counsellor,well that's I mean at least you're not doing that so that's good but it's still causing a lot of problems and as I said I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth you're causing some serious damage and this needs to stop have you thought about quitting
9916,low_083,client,well I didn't really know I'd started
9917,low_083,counsellor,what do you mean
9918,low_083,client,I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking. Just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.
9919,low_083,counsellor,so you're going to quit then oh
9920,low_083,client,maybe
9921,low_083,counsellor,what do you mean maybe I just told you how bad it is for you it's messing up your mouth you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases this is really important you need to quit
9922,low_083,client,well it's something that I'll have to think about
9923,low_083,counsellor,what's there to think about you said it's not that something you do all that often I'm there's all these negative side effects there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in
9924,low_083,client,well it's just something that I do to relax and I don't with that often and so I probably could cut back
9925,low_083,counsellor,okay well that's a good start but cutting back isn't going to do it if you actually quit the smoking you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth and you can stop yourself from from being at risk for these other diseases but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger
9926,low_083,client,well I don't believe that their cigars and what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right and it's something that I choose to do and so I will think about cutting back but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that and I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real
9927,low_083,counsellor,you're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually it can cause problems with your teeth too I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before that's another side effect there are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use whether it's cigarettes cigars dip to snuff snooze who got any of it this is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die
9928,low_083,client,well it's something that I'll think about
9929,low_083,counsellor,well I appreciate you thinking about I hope you'll think about it really hard you know this is something that I'm going to continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change
9930,low_084,client,no that's all of it
9931,low_084,counsellor,great what I'd like to do just before you go is your recall in your reception the receptionist gave you a questionnaire to fill in
9932,low_084,client,yeah
9933,low_084,counsellor,I just like to talk to you about their she enters it in the computer and I see from the way you filled it in we at the moment from a perspective of your health will classify your physical activity is inactive
9934,low_084,client,what
9935,low_084,counsellor,inactive so at the moment I'm like we're going to
9936,low_084,client,have a very busy life
9937,low_084,counsellor,perhaps what I could tell you is looked at the moment the current recommendation for health is that everybody should do minutes of moderate exercise at least five days that the week that's to benefit their head I fleets you mean now everybody
9938,low_084,client,why why would I want to do that much
9939,low_084,counsellor,what's really important is particularly as somebody your age is you're really entering that age where we really need to think about heart disease diabetes
9940,low_084,client,it's nothing wrong with my health and
9941,low_084,counsellor,that's that's how we'd like to keep it of course and if you were to exercise at that level what we know is you half your risk of getting heart disease having high blood pressure getting diabetes gaining weight etc and of course my concern is that you're healthy at the moment we keep you there
9942,low_084,client,so what are you telling me but
9943,low_084,counsellor,what we really need to discuss is how we can get you to be a bit more physically active start moving this along a little bit
9944,low_084,client,I have a very busy life
9945,low_084,counsellor,so you do a lot of things but from where you feel this in you really don't do enough physical activity to benefit your help or
9946,low_084,client,Give me for disagreeing with you but when you run a business but I do I mean I've got I got people in my company. What you're saying it do you think it's easy running a company? Is it buddy chica thing you got telling me I'll growth when am I supposed to take time to get that don't want to go the gym edge? Imagine how running your cum I'm not aware the factory all day long you think that's not exercise? I'm not sitting at a desk like you. I'm sure you're all I Gobert all right I just like night.
9947,low_084,counsellor,I understand that you're on the go all the time but what's really important is no more that you protect your health now. Imagine running your business if you're held in the dark deteriorate.
9948,low_084,client,there's nothing wrong with my health
9949,low_084,counsellor,and that's the way we'd like to keep it of course and what I'm really concerned about is all men of your age of my age is our health now is at a point where it starts to you know we have to think about heart disease and things like diabetes and one really good way of protecting ourselves this is to be physically active well we'll go around in circles it because i would say i am particularly active well
9950,low_084,client,what are you telling me i should do that i don't do
9951,low_084,counsellor,well if you think about that recommendation that any equivalent if you like of walk in two to three miles an hour a day at a fairly fast pace there are things equivalent to that not just being on the go that's you know marching rather than strolling mm-hmm
9952,low_084,client,and when would you like me to do this i mean i'm at work six thirty in the morning often don't go home till eight o'clock at night
9953,low_084,counsellor,well ideally this is something to do every day this is kind of a minimum amount of physical activity
9954,low_084,client,there can't be done
9955,low_084,counsellor,well one of the things i should tell you about is that not doing this so not doing much physical activity does really increase this one of the most important risk factors for heart disease for some cancers colon cancer that affects many men and for elevated blood pressure all the things that we see are getting common in men as they get older start to become more risky if we avoid physical activity
9956,low_084,client,yeah are you just trying to scare me now aren't you I'm not equate I don't need I don't need all this
9957,low_084,counsellor,so it's a genuine concern and obviously part of my job is to let you know about my concern and make sure you've got the right information to make decisions about your health and this is one of the important things you can't
9958,low_084,client,okay well I've got time to go walking every day so what's the next best thing I can do
9959,low_084,counsellor,well the good news is you don't have to do it all in one go you can do 10 minutes in the morning 10 minutes at lunch time and ten minutes of an evening that would still lead to important health benefits I see anything in the bigger scheme of things is 30 minutes investment in your health worth it
9960,low_084,client,well people don't like that well of course is I don't to get sick but I die I just don't think it's necessary but I'm perfectly healthy so what why do you think it's so important
9961,low_084,counsellor,oh because the evidence tells us it really is an important risk factor similar in the way that smoking is we know now obviously everyone takes it as a bit of given that smoking's not really a good thing to do for their health and we're realizing that physical activity is the same avoiding physical activity is as much of a risk to your health as smoking is well well what else could I do well I'd like you to really give some thought to doing a good brisk walk in the mornings every day and again in the evenings and you turn me walking around the factory is not enough well I suspect I don't know of course but I suspect it's not really the equivalent of a good March for ten continuum minutes
9962,low_084,client,can I ask you a personal question well you say you know we're men of a simulator much exercise do you get
9963,low_084,counsellor,well I try like you I've got a busy job and we're always on call etc but i do really try and fit in a good strong walk every day does that mean you do it every day most days most days I do
9964,low_084,client,well if you could do I suppose I could do it
9965,low_084,counsellor,I think I do really think it's very important for you
9966,low_084,client,you think it would make a big difference
9967,low_084,counsellor,I think you'd be surprised how much difference it made and indeed when you're at work I suspect you know it'll help with the energy you have for that busy job. In the long term it yeah one way to think about it it's a real investment in the future.
9968,low_084,client,I'm not convinced
9969,low_084,counsellor,Jeff family Jeff
9970,low_084,client,yes I have family
9971,low_084,counsellor,so you can imagine at some point in the future you know you don't want to be in a situation where you you know want to play with the grandchildren for example and you can't because you simply unfit
9972,low_084,client,yeah well my grandchildren live overseas and actually so I don't get to see the left mmm
9973,low_084,counsellor,but you see my point
9974,low_084,client,goodbye I'm not stupid
9975,low_084,counsellor,you don't want your lack of fitness no I mean how you behind on you know of course that I supply golf but I doubt the time these days mm-hmm take you have been fitter
9976,low_084,client,what I was younger yeah yeah
9977,low_084,counsellor,so you think that's something you could do again
9978,low_084,client,no yeah because you know it says it is a popular pastime and it of course unless rubbish at it and I've got walking is a different matter I want what more bye dad is he really true walking did make a difference
9979,low_084,counsellor,yes if you do it briskly mm-hmm this is
9980,low_084,client,I do everything bristly
9981,low_084,counsellor,yeah well walk walking briskly does lead to very substantial health benefits yeah and
9982,low_084,client,well I'll try it I'm going to
9983,low_084,counsellor,when do you think you will do something
9984,low_084,client,when I because these things you can imagine you're easy to agree to and then we meet again in a few weeks time and i'll tell you what i'll do then ok you've been straight with me I'll be straight with you instead of driving to work i'll walk to work that will take me minutes that'd be fantastic that's right well I'll get my chauffeur to take me home
9985,low_084,counsellor,ok so deal then mm-hmm when we should start doing that geez
9986,low_084,client,I could do it tomorrow ok so deal with
9987,low_084,counsellor,then you're going to do minutes of brisk walking today give it a try
9988,low_084,client,yeah if it does it up and I'm feeling different after a month I won't bother anymore because it be frank it's an inconvenience but I'll do it for you
9989,low_084,counsellor,why don't you and I meet again in a month mmm take stop and you can tell me what you found out yeah and then we'll have another chat about it then ok all right we'll do that ok alright fair enough thanks Jeff see you again in a month

10023,low_086,counsellor,it sounds like you're keen to get healthy I like your practical attitude the new filling will fix this hole but it won't stop new holes from occurring as I said I really would like to try to help you so we can avoid you having to get any fillings in the future on that note would be really great to try to get to know what you've been eating and drinking

10029,low_086,counsellor,the bacteria actually use the sugar that's in your mouth to create acids and it's these acids that eat through the tooth surfaces to cause holes so you could say the more the teeth are coated in sugar the more likely it is that you're going to get holes if we're able to chat a little bit more about your diet I might be able to help you so that we can reduce the risk of you needing fillings in the future
10030,low_086,client,or anyone I chat about my diet right now can we just get this feeling done

10194,low_092,counsellor,"Yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like."
10195,low_092,client,"This is insane, alright. I think you're the one who needs therapy. I'm-I'm leaving."
10196,low_092,counsellor,"Okay, um, so, um, off-topic, would you ever want to get together sometime? We can drink red wine, listen to the Smiths..."
10197,low_092,client,"Nope, I'm done."
10198,low_092,counsellor,Okay. Okay. Mmm... So handsome... mmm.
10199,low_093,client,I'm okay.
10200,low_093,counsellor,Good. Here take a look. See what you think. Isn't that feeling
10201,low_093,client,Yep
10202,low_093,counsellor,And the colors okay?
10203,low_093,client,Yep
10204,low_093,counsellor,You know there is quite a lot of staining. So umm I'm just wondering about umm some concerns about smoking possibly.
10205,low_093,client,Eh... I'm going to get that again.
10206,low_093,counsellor,"coffee, tea yeah, and you've heard this before I'm sure."
10207,low_093,client,I do all of the above
10208,low_093,counsellor,"So you know the smoking is going be related to not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically. It it effects dental carries, dental cavities."
10209,low_093,client,Yeah
10210,low_093,counsellor,Umm healing.
10211,low_093,client,Yeah ok
10212,low_093,counsellor,in your mouth. Soo
10213,low_093,client,I've heard it all but I just want to get my teeth fixed.
10214,low_093,counsellor,"Yes and I really want to be helpful. I really want you to know my commitment is to your oral health so umm there are lots of medications out there, David, that actually take away a lot of the cravings. They make things so much easier."
10215,low_093,client,I did a pill thing so I did try it. I did try it. I did the pill thing and they didn't work.
10216,low_093,counsellor,mmm
10217,low_093,client,It was a waste and it uh caused more side effects.
10218,low_093,counsellor,No it but David. David it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting.
10219,low_093,client,Or seven lectures along the road.
10220,low_093,counsellor,Ah well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture.
10221,low_093,client,Well
10222,low_093,counsellor,That's certainly not what I meant.
10223,low_093,client,"Naw I just feel that way. I get really, I get very defensive about when I get it from my family doc my cardiologist, everybody. Like I'm not a complete fool. I am for smoking."
10224,low_093,counsellor,Well there there's a reason that.
10225,low_093,client,It's not easy to quit.
10226,low_093,counsellor,people are concerned. No but as I said these medications So you've tried the medication you've been willing once
10227,low_093,client,Yep
10228,low_093,counsellor,Then can I write you a prescription for the medication and can we talk about how you could use it because this is something that that it's very important. Not just for your overall physical health
10229,low_093,client,"I guess I gotta really want to. Things I've tried, they usually cause me more problems than they helped."
10230,low_093,counsellor,"Oh no, the smoking will cause you more problems than the than anything else. I can promise you that. David, the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking."
10231,low_093,client,mmm
10232,low_093,counsellor,Like that's the thing to really consider.
10233,low_093,client,"Okay well, can I go now? I know what, I know Doc what you're trying to, I I just don't want to get into that right now."
10234,low_093,counsellor,"Okay. Well thanks for listening and honestly I, I am really worried about the smoking so"
10235,low_093,client,Okay
10236,low_093,counsellor,I uh
10237,low_093,client,I appreciate your care.
10238,low_093,counsellor,I'm here to help. Okay?
10239,low_093,client,Okay.
10240,low_094,client,"Mm-hmm, yeah, I, I definitely don't want to come back here but, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms but the..."
10241,low_094,counsellor,Yeah.
10242,low_094,client,... ridiculous part is I've had him for twelve years before and now it's a problem.
10243,low_094,counsellor,"Well you sound a bit surprised by that but I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma. Pets are a really big source of problems, in that respect."
10244,low_094,client,"Yeah bu-, I, um, let me just clarify. I've seen the materials, I have them..."
10245,low_094,counsellor,Mm-hmm.
10246,low_094,client,I haven't read them. All I've been doing is taking the medicine so I don't know that much about this.
10247,low_094,counsellor,"Well, w-, wait a second, Sal. What do you mean yo-, yo-, ha-, if you, as an, you know, to be informed about I'm just re-, really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby?"
10248,low_094,client,Yeah.
10249,low_094,counsellor,A new baby?
10250,low_094,client,"Gian-Carlo, yeah."
10251,low_094,counsellor,"And you are very concerned about your health. You want to be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps you've, you've almost quit smoking..."
10252,low_094,client,Mm-hmm.
10253,low_094,counsellor,"...which is fantastic. So the next step is to really d-, deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it's, it's going to be hard to do that but there are always people who will adopt animals. I'm sure that you have friends or family members."
10254,low_094,client,"Uh...this is a little too much right now. First of all Gian-Carlo is taken care of, that's fine. He doesn't have no asthma from the dog. It's just me, I don't have..."
10255,low_094,counsellor,"It's you that I'm worried about, Sal."
10256,low_094,client,Ah
10257,low_094,counsellor,"It's you that I'm worried about. OK. Th-, the symptoms are worse. You've had two or three major asthma attacks and I, do you appreciate how this is a-, a-, a risk to your life that there are some some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms. It, it truly is something to take very very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough."
10258,low_094,client,"So Oscar's going to make me die. He hasn't made me die in twelve years and the doctor saying, ""oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking,"" so what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die? I've had him for twelve years."
10259,low_094,counsellor,"Sal, wh-, ah, do, you understand that what happened six years ago or ten years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse. You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone. You know this."
10260,low_094,client,Well they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one and I'll keep Oscar.
10261,low_094,counsellor,"Sal, you're almost on the strongest one. And if Oscar's that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your baby? Than your wife? Like, ah, that makes no sense to me. Do you understand how important this is?"
10262,low_094,client,I understand that I don't think you get my situation. I've had this dog for twelve years so I'm not just going to up and get him out of my house when I don't even know if that's the main thing.
10263,low_094,counsellor,[Sighs]
10264,low_094,client,Ho-...
10265,low_094,counsellor,OK.
10266,low_095,client,Yeah.
10267,low_095,counsellor,"Great, how are you doing today?"
10268,low_095,client,"Oh, pretty good, always busy this time of year but keeping up. How are you?"
10269,low_095,counsellor,"Doing great. Alright, your blood pressure is over"
10270,low_095,client,That's good right?
10271,low_095,counsellor,Yes.
10272,low_095,client,"Good, I've always been healthy"
10273,low_095,counsellor,"Well, not always. It looks like you got a letter about your AC and you haven't been taking very good care of your diabetes."
10274,low_095,client,My what?
10275,low_095,counsellor,Your AC. It measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months to determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar.
10276,low_095,client,"Oh yeah, I got that letter but I didn't really know what it meant and I never really paid attention to my diabetes because I feel fine how bad is it?"
10277,low_095,counsellor,"Well let's see. today it was . and three months ago, it was . So normal is less than , you're way out of control."
10278,low_095,client,"Well, like I've said, I've been way busy this month."
10279,low_095,counsellor,Well your health is something you have to make time for. Have you at least been taking your diabetic medications?
10280,low_095,client,"Not really, I rather use diet and exercise."
10281,low_095,counsellor,"Well it looks like that's not really adequate, so you need to be taking your medications. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough. Your chart says that you've been prescribed Metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think it will be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?"
10282,low_095,client,"Um, Yeah sometimes."
10283,low_095,counsellor,"Ok, how often?"
10284,low_095,client,"Oh, once every few weeks but I feel fine so I don't think it's that bad."
10285,low_095,counsellor,"Well remember, your AC was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel. So um, it showed that you were out of control. If you don't start making changes, you can permanently damage your eyesight, blood vessels, even have to have a front leg amputated."
10286,low_095,client,"Oh, well I'll definitely do something before it got that bad, but I'm not interested in taking those medications. I'll try to eat better or do something"
10287,low_095,counsellor,I don't think you realize how serious your disease is.
10288,low_095,client,I don't see how I can be sick if I feel fine. I don't want to take medications.
10289,low_095,counsellor,*Sigh* Just because you feel fine doesn't mean that you're healthy. Having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big ulcer on their foot.
10290,low_095,client,"Well, I remember my doctor telling me something about the symptoms of high blood sugar like feeling shaky or tired, but I never felt shaky or tired."
10291,low_095,counsellor,"Well, those are some symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms. That's the whole reason for doing an AC, to determine if your blood sugar is out of control, and your AC showed that your blood sugar has been out of control."
10292,low_095,client,"I get what you're saying, but I feel fine and I don't want to take something that's not going to make me feel any better. I mean, what if it makes me worse? When my grandfather was on heart medications, the levels got so high that he almost got a heart attack."
10293,low_095,counsellor,"Heart medications and diabetic medications are very different. You can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication, they're completely different. Will you at least try taking your medications?"
10294,low_095,client,"I don't know, I will think about it."
10295,low_095,counsellor,"Alright, well we'll see you in a few months then."
10296,low_096,client,It calms my nerves. It makes me feel good.
10297,low_096,counsellor,It calms your nerves and makes you feel good.
10298,low_096,client,I can't go without it.
10299,low_096,counsellor,"OK Ms. Fisher listen to this, by continuing to smoke you are putting your body in a great amount of harm. COPD, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, all these other type of bad things. You know so why haven't you quit yet?"
10300,low_096,client,Because it's hard and I like it.
10301,low_096,counsellor,I don't understand. What's so tough about it? Can't you understand that you are putting your body at great harm by continuing to smoke?
10302,low_096,client,I mean I guess so.
10303,low_096,counsellor,You guess so. OK so good. So that means you want to quit now right?
10304,low_096,client,Yeah
10305,low_096,counsellor,"OK, good, good I'm glad to hear you say that. So this is what were gonna do. First, were gonna set a quit date. Next, I want you to go home and remove all the cigarettes in your surroundings. Like, as soon as you leave here. And then finally, I'm gonna give you this prescription for Chantix which you can take every day, and also these nicotine patches. Ok."
10306,low_096,client,Yeah
10307,low_096,counsellor,"Ok, alright good. We'll set an appointment for you to come see me in another month. When we see you in another month you need to have quit smoking cigarettes because you know how bad it is for you. Alright? Alright, you can pick up the prescription from my nurse on your way out and then call me at the clinic if you have any questions. OK. Thank you so much it was good seeing you again. OK, Alright. Take care. Bye"
10308,low_097,client,That's great.
10309,low_097,counsellor,"However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here... the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so..."
10310,low_097,client,I don't...
10311,low_097,counsellor,I'm just wondering what's going on.
10312,low_097,client,I don't smoke cigarettes.
10313,low_097,counsellor,"OK. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation. In particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really deathly white colored, and there's little red spots, and you probably didn't notice cause we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth. But you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called, Nicotinex Domotitus, and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes. Are you smoking a pipe? Or cigars? Or, is there something else that.."
10314,low_097,client,Well...
10315,low_097,counsellor,"Could be contributing to this, because I don't know what else might be causing it."
10316,low_097,client,"Well, no. Only thing... I've never smoked cigarettes, ever."
10317,low_097,counsellor,Mmm hmm.
10318,low_097,client,"Um, but, um, when um, when I got with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges..."
10319,low_097,counsellor,Mmm hmm.
10320,low_097,client,"And, um, you know, sometimes there are those... those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things, and we got some of those many, uh, cigars, that Swisher Sweets..."
10321,low_097,counsellor,Uh huh.
10322,low_097,client,"They come in peach, and grape, and... and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that, that's got tobacco in it."
10323,low_097,counsellor,"OK. So, I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit flavored, people think they're OK. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?"
10324,low_097,client,"Really bad, but they're just little, mini little, cute little, girly cigars."
10325,low_097,counsellor,"Right. They're still cigars. And they're still tobacco. And so, they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema. All those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes."
10326,low_097,client,"Well, I only use 'em..."
10327,low_097,counsellor,This is really important.
10328,low_097,client,"Just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke twenty or thirty cigarettes a day. I mean, I only do it when we go out."
10329,low_097,counsellor,"Uh huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that. So, that's good. But it's still causing a lot of problems, and as I said, I can see the... the evidence in the roof of your mouth. You're causing some serious damage. And this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?"
10330,low_097,client,"Well, I didn't really know I'd started."
10331,low_097,counsellor,What do you mean?
10332,low_097,client,I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking. Just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.
10333,low_097,counsellor,"So, you're gonna quit then?"
10334,low_097,client,"Uhh, maybe."
10335,low_097,counsellor,"What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth. You're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit."
10336,low_097,client,"Well, it's something that I'll have to think about."
10337,low_097,counsellor,"What's there to think about? You said it's not, that... something you do all that often. Um, there's all these negative side effects. There's all these risks that you're putting yourself in."
10338,low_097,client,"Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so, I probably could cut back."
10339,low_097,counsellor,"OK, well that's a good start, but cutting back isn't gonna do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from... from being at risk for these other diseases. But, but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars, you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger."
10340,low_097,client,"Well, I don't believe that they're cigars, and... what I do believe is that, it's a choice. And it's my right. And it's something that I choose to do. And so, I will think about cutting back. But I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that, and I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real."
10341,low_097,counsellor,"You're choosing to really damage your mouth, and actually it can cause problems with your teeth, too. I don't know if you've noticed your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use. Whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chews, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making, and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick, and potentially die."
10342,low_097,client,"Well, it's something that I'll think about."
10343,low_097,counsellor,"Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about, because it's something that really needs to change."
10344,low_098,client,"Uh yea, I just got off work and apparently they're going smoke free so I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and they say they work very well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day."
10345,low_098,counsellor,So you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking?
10346,low_098,client,"Maybe like, during the day nicotine replacement. Is that, I mean do you have anything like that?"
10347,low_098,counsellor,"Yea, we don't really recommend that. The idea is that you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either."
10348,low_098,client,"Well I don't really want to quit, I mean I like smoking, I like going after work to have a beer with my friends, not smoke cigarettes. I mean, I know it's not really a big deal, cigarettes aren't that bad. I mean I know it's popular to say smoking is bad for you but ya know, I like it so I'm going to keep doing it."
10349,low_098,counsellor,"Okay well smoking really is really bad for you, you know it causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease."
10350,low_098,client,Yeah. Okay.
10351,low_098,counsellor,Oral disease.
10352,low_098,client,"Oh well what are my options now? Assuming that I am right, what are my options?"
10353,low_098,counsellor,"Well to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch, I can't recommend a patch to you if you're going to continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now."
10354,low_098,client,I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean I probably smoked about or years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes but it's sorta hard to get through the day at work.
10355,low_098,counsellor,Okay well we actually consider cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.
10356,low_098,client,Sounds good to me. The more nicotine the better. Is there like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. Do you have?
10357,low_098,counsellor,"Well there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, then probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something that you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however but gum is something you use just when you have a craving."
10358,low_098,client,Oh. Okay. Well where is that?
10359,low_098,counsellor,"Well, we have that here but again but the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking."
10360,low_098,client,"Well, I'm probably not going to buy anything today. I mean I just came by to see what my options are. Thanks for the input. Do you have anything else? Do you have any other?"
10361,low_098,counsellor,Well.
10362,low_098,client,Advice for me?
10363,low_098,counsellor,"Aside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you, again that's not something you wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement but again that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke."
10364,low_098,client,"Oh well. Okay, well, thanks, I mean I guess that helps a little bit. Maybe I'll be back later. Thanks."
10365,low_099,client,Yeah.
10366,low_099,counsellor,That's really a problem.
10367,low_099,client,"Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really upset."
10368,low_099,counsellor,"Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?"
10369,low_099,client,"Yeah, I ... Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him."
10370,low_099,counsellor,"Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections, is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke. And so, what can you tell me about that?"
10371,low_099,client,"I ... I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car, um, when he's home, I go outside to smoke. I just ... I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around it, so I try really hard."
10372,low_099,counsellor,"I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Do you know, smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where he'll have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also things like vitamins C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In additions to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?"
10373,low_099,client,"No. But I don't smoke ... I ... I ... I've thought about quitting, but it's just, it's really hard. So, I just don't know how to do it."
10374,low_099,counsellor,"Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for Emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease. For all kinds of things."
10375,low_099,client,"I know, I know. I've heard people tell me before. I've heard all that. I just ... don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's so hard."
10376,low_099,counsellor,"Well, there's all kinds of things you can use know. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum. There's the inhaler. There's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban. There's quit smoking groups you can go to. There's hotlines you can call ..."
10377,low_099,client,I just don't have time for any of that ...
10378,low_099,counsellor,There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit. This is really important.
10379,low_099,client,"I understand that. I know it is ... I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really, it's really really hard."
10380,low_099,counsellor,"Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?"
10381,low_099,client,I don't know.
10382,low_099,counsellor,I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.
10383,low_099,client,"I'll, I'll, I'll go look at all those things and I'll find ... I guess I'll try to find something, and I'll talk to my doctor about it."
10384,low_099,counsellor,"OK, well I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger."
10385,low_099,client,OK. Whatever. OK.
10386,low_099,counsellor,OK
10387,low_100,client,No. It's Alexis miss.
10388,low_100,counsellor,"Ah Alexis. And... Yes, of Course. Yes. Yes. What can I do for you?"
10389,low_100,client,"Uh, I'd just like to speak to you about some personal problems."
10390,low_100,counsellor,"Ah, personal problems? Oh is this going to be about something serious? Come sit. Come. Come. There we go. That's it. That's it. Alright. Umm...I'm going to sit here. Yes. What's your problem?"
10391,low_100,client,"Well Miss, Um I don't know how to say this. Miss, I think I might be pregnant."
10392,low_100,counsellor,"Pr...whooo You said you might be pregnant? Uh my goodness alive. Okay. Alright. No, We can deal... Now we...alright, now we can deal with this. Umm...okay, just back up. Tell me, tell me, tell me how it happened."
10393,low_100,client,"Well, Miss, it's my family Miss. My mom and my dad aren't in a very good relationship mostly. Then, like and then like I met my boyfriend and then and then like I also am not on the pill, Miss and then like you know stuff happens. And now I think I might be pregnant."
10394,low_100,counsellor,Now are you on the pill?
10395,low_100,client,No Miss. Like I just said I'm not on the pill.
10396,low_100,counsellor,"You're not on the... You're not on the pill? What are you thinking? What? Is your, is your head not attached to your body or something? Eh?"
10397,low_100,client,Ahhh.
10398,low_100,counsellor,The nerve. Going all willy nilly with some guy and you're not even on the pill. What do you? What do you even? Uh these children now-a-days. It's so ....
10399,low_100,client,"I know Miss. It's just that, like my family, you know Miss. It will kill them."
10400,low_100,counsellor,"Okay. So just hold on, hold on. Ya. Lulu, I just got Alexis here. She thinks she's pregnant. I'm going to need about ten minutes. Okay? Ten minutes. Alright. Great. Yes. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Yes."
10401,low_100,client,"Well Miss, like I know I know I was stupid ma'am. It's just like"
10402,low_100,counsellor,"Stupid? You're stupid? Sheesh. I don't know. I just don't know. You know you would swing the, the... You don't even know how, how difficult life could be, yeah? Life, my girl, life is tough. I mean, you just saw, I've got meetings to go to. I've got things to do in the evenings. Life is difficult my girl. You've got to take... You've got to learn to take responsibility. My life. If you knew how difficult my life can be, yeah."
10403,low_100,client,I know life is hard. I love him Miss. He's the only thing I've got and I don't want to lose him because of this whole thing.
10404,low_100,counsellor,"Oh please. You think you...you think you have him? You don't have him. Let me tell you a thing girl. You don't have that guy. Uh, huh. I know his type. He's out there. He's out there with the other girls and he's probably impregnated about three by now. Huh? You're just one of the lot. Don't think you've got him. You don't have him."
10405,low_100,client,"Miss, don't tell me that. I don't want to tell anyone this because I haven't told him."
10406,low_100,counsellor,"Okay, just hold on, hold on."
10407,low_100,client,I haven't told him.
10408,low_100,counsellor,"Okay. Sht. Wants to save him. Um. Okay, Alright. I know what. I know what to do. You just leave everything to me. You don't worry. Alright. Look. Look. Don't, you don't worry about your family. You don't, you don't, don't tell your family. No. That's, that's what you must do. You don't tell your fam...what I'll do, here we go. Here's a name of a person and a telephone number. You phone them. Phone them. That's it. That's it. You keep that number. Don't worry about your family okay."
10409,low_100,client,"Well Miss, I don't understand. In class you said that when something important happens then you must tell your family. You know how bad this is."
10410,low_100,counsellor,"What, what are you saying? Are you trying to say that I'm wrong? Uh, heh, don't, don't do that. Don't do that. I'm not wrong gir. I know what I'm doing. You just, you find that number and, and, and they will, they will help you. Don't you question what I'm doing. Alright. Okay. You find that number."
10411,low_100,client,Of course I'm not.
10412,low_100,counsellor,All the best. All the best. Okay. That's it. That's it. There you go.
10413,low_101,client,"No, not really."
10414,low_101,counsellor,"Why, what happened?"
10415,low_101,client,"Well, since I had a relapse back in the spring, I've noticed I've had a lot more trouble with my walking, and a lot of problems with my memory. And I'm just tired all the time."
10416,low_101,counsellor,Well how long ago did this all begin?
10417,low_101,client,After that relapse about two or three months ago.
10418,low_101,counsellor,Well have you been taking your Rubiff reguarly?
10419,low_101,client,"No, not really. I don't feel like it's helping much."
10420,low_101,counsellor,Well when did you stop taking it?
10421,low_101,client,"Well, first I started by just stretching it out. I was only taking it every three to four days, and then I totally stopped at about a month ago."
10422,low_101,counsellor,So your symptoms may be because you stopped your drug?
10423,low_101,client,"I don't think so. I didn't stop taking it until after my walking started to go. After that I did everything you told me to do. I took my shots religiously, a lot of help it's been."
10424,low_101,counsellor,I think you should go back on the drug. We know from clinical trial that it helps to slow progression. Going off it is only going to make things worse.
10425,low_101,client,"I don't know if I believe that. I mean if it does, it hasn't helped me."
10426,low_101,counsellor,"Well, the data's clear! I think the first thing we need to do is get you back on the drug. We also need to change the way you're thinking about your MS and the drug. Drug's not a cure. It's only gonna slow progression. You know if you weren't on this drug, your symptoms would've come back sooner. And you need to think of the last two years that you've had without major symptoms as a success."
10427,low_101,client,"Well, that's hard to do when you feel like I do."
10428,low_101,counsellor,"I know, I see this all the time with my patients."
10429,low_101,client,So is this normal?
10430,low_101,counsellor,"I wouldn't say ""normal"". MS is different for everyone."
10431,low_101,client,So what about me?
10432,low_101,counsellor,Well that's hard to say. So I'll see you in three months and you can start going back on the drug. Any questions?
10433,low_101,client,No
10434,low_102,counsellor,"Good afternoon, this is April from the pharmacy, could I speak to Faith please?"
10435,low_102,client,This is faith.
10436,low_102,counsellor,I see you haven't picked up your prescription this month. Are you having some problems with it?
10437,low_102,client,Are you talking about my Avenex?
10438,low_102,counsellor,Yeah.
10439,low_102,client,"Well, I haven't been taking it for the last couple of weeks. To be honest, I took it for a year because my neurologist told me I should, but lately I haven't seen any reason to continue doing it because I don't feel better and I don't think I'm doing that badly."
10440,low_102,counsellor,Who' your doctor?
10441,low_102,client,"Dr. Livingston. He's my neurologist. I think I remember him saying something about it slowly the progression, but frankly April, I don't know what that means. He doesn't explain things very well, and if I ask him, he doesn't take the time to answer my questions."
10442,low_102,counsellor,Have you had any symptoms lately?
10443,low_102,client,"No, not really."
10444,low_102,counsellor,Do you have any problems taking the drug?
10445,low_102,client,"I'm not crazy about taking the shots, but that's not the issue."
10446,low_102,counsellor,Are you having problems paying for it because we can help you with that.
10447,low_102,client,"No, my HMO covers it."
10448,low_102,counsellor,I'm not sure I understand what the problem is.
10449,low_102,client,"Well, like I said, I don't see the point of taking this drug. What's it doing for me?"
10450,low_102,counsellor,"As it says in the patient education kit you received, it reduces the risk of a second attack by over forty percent. The clinical data is very strong."
10451,low_102,client,"Well, now you're sounding just like my neurologist. I still don't understand what that means."
10452,low_102,counsellor,"Well, Avonex provides a thirty seven percent reduction in risk of progression to sustain disability in two years and a forty-four reduction in risk of developing a second relapse in up-to three years."
10453,low_102,client,Okay?
10454,low_102,counsellor,Are you interested in reordering your prescription?
10455,low_102,client,"No, not really, I, I think I want to think about this for a while."
10456,low_102,counsellor,It's important that you stay on it. There aren't really many options for MS.
10457,low_102,client,"Well, maybe we have to wait until something better comes along."
10458,low_102,counsellor,My expert opinion is that you stay on the medication until it does. Until newer drugs are developed this is the best we have.
10459,low_102,client,Well that's depressing.
10460,low_102,counsellor,"Well, only if you think about it that way."
10461,low_102,client,"Yeah, okay. So are we done?"
10462,low_102,counsellor,Unless there's anything else I can do to help.
10463,low_102,client,"No, thank, bye."
10464,low_102,counsellor,"Okay, bye bye."
10465,low_103,client,Right.
10466,low_103,counsellor,And now she's coughing. Um.
10467,low_103,client,Yes
10468,low_103,counsellor,Sounds like post-nasal drip. I think it's probably just a virus.
10469,low_103,client,Okay.
10470,low_103,counsellor,"Um, and I don't think she needs antibiotics, it's not going to do anything."
10471,low_103,client,"Good, okay."
10472,low_103,counsellor,"But uh, and she'll probably be better by the weekend."
10473,low_103,client,Good.
10474,low_103,counsellor,"Um, before we finish up today I think we really need to talk about Ganesa weight."
10475,low_103,client,Okay.
10476,low_103,counsellor,"Um, according to the chart she is has a BMI of which is at the percentile, which is considerably overweight and we need to think about getting her weight down. Um, does she eat healthy does she, is she pretty active?"
10477,low_103,client,"Okay, well, I don't know anything about this, um, BMI or percentile, but I mean, she's a big boned girl. All of the girls in our family are. I mean she's active, she's growing. She looks healthy to me."
10478,low_103,counsellor,"Well, I think we need to check her cholesterol and her triglycerides. Cus, um, at this BMI, they, um, there might be some problems already, some serious problems, and if we look at these labs now, you know maybe you'll start to see that this is a serious problem."
10479,low_103,client,"Okay, I don't know about all that, but I just brought her in here for a cough. Plus, you know, Ganesa hates needles and she was proud that there was no needles today."
10480,low_103,counsellor,"Well, I guess the blood work can wait, but we're going to have to get it done within the next year. Let's talk about her exercise, does she get enough aerobic exercise?"
10481,low_103,client,"Well, yeah, at school and on weekends, she sometimes plays with her friends, but she's very active, she, she's strong."
10482,low_103,counsellor,"Okay, okay, well what about her diet. Does she eat a lot of junk food or drink soda?"
10483,low_103,client,"Well, we eat together a lot. And I mean, we only go to the fast food restaurant a few times a week. And she always drinks lemonade, never soda."
10484,low_103,counsellor,"Okay, well, um, you're going to have to cut the fast food down to no more than once a week. And lemonade, it's as bad as soda, it's full of sugar, so you're going to have to get her to drink more water."
10485,low_103,client,"Well, with the, the stress on my job, and, and, working long hours, I mean, sometimes we only get to eat fast food. And, and, she won't drink water."
10486,low_103,counsellor,"Oh, Okay, well, do what you can. And tell me about her T.V. Does she watch a lot of T.V.?"
10487,low_103,client,"Well I mean a few hours after school. I mean, more than what I would like. I mean, I try, but no kids don't listen."
10488,low_103,counsellor,"Okay, well, the American Academy Pediatrics recommends no more than two hours a day, so I think we're going to have to get that down to below two hours."
10489,low_103,client,"Well, that's going to be very difficult because, I, I need that time so that I can catch up on."
10490,low_103,counsellor,"Okay,"
10491,low_103,client,Um
10492,low_103,counsellor,"well, listen um, we're going to need to finish up here. I'd really like to see Ganesa lose three to five pounds before we see her again. So, let me just kinda go over what we talked about. More water, less junk food, less fast food and uh, cut down on the TV. Does that sound okay?"
10493,low_103,client,Okay.
10494,low_103,counsellor,"Okay, Thanks for coming in."
10495,low_103,client,Thanks
10496,low_104,client,Hi.
10497,low_104,counsellor,How are you?
10498,low_104,client,"Yeah, I've been sitting here saying that word."
10499,low_104,counsellor,"Well, I don't know last time I called you and then the phone is not ringing and I'm not sure.  I'm glad you called."
10500,low_104,client,Yup.
10501,low_104,counsellor,And set up an appointment with me.
10502,low_104,client,"Yup, for the last three days, we've had storms and it's been cloudy and I have not had no signal on this phone until today."
10503,low_104,counsellor,Wow.
10504,low_104,client,Because I had four or five people have called me.
10505,low_104,counsellor,Really?
10506,low_104,client,"Yeah, and I just didn't get it."
10507,low_104,counsellor,"Well, before we begin I just want to remind you that all calls at Aetna is subject to be monitored and recorded for the quality assurance, okay."
10508,low_104,client,"Yup, yes ma'am."
10509,low_104,counsellor,"And then also about genetic information non discrimination act just a reminder too that because of legislation prohibits gathering genetic information so when you answer my question you don't have to include any family medical history or any information related to genetics, okay?"
10510,low_104,client,Uh-huh.
10511,low_104,counsellor,So how you been since I spoke to you last time?
10512,low_104,client,"Oh, I've been fine.  I've been to the doctor; I went for my six months checkup."
10513,low_104,counsellor,"Okay, when was that?"
10514,low_104,client,rd of June.
10515,low_104,counsellor,"Okay, what the doctor say?"
10516,low_104,client,"That everything looked good, they took my blood and I haven't heard a thing from them.  Most times they usually send me something if something is wrong."
10517,low_104,counsellor,"Usually, yeah, if you don't hear from the doctor that means good news isn't it?"
10518,low_104,client,"Yeah, yeah."
10519,low_104,counsellor,Because if something's wrong most definitely they will call you.
10520,low_104,client,"Uh-huh, yup, my six month checkup."
10521,low_104,counsellor,So you do all the cholesterol check and everything?
10522,low_104,client,I don't do nothing.
10523,low_104,counsellor,I mean the doctor draws your blood work.
10524,low_104,client,"Yeah, yeah, they drew all the blood, I think they draw two vials of blood.  He said that they would notify me within about three or four days, but I never have, they usually send a piece of paper stating that everything was okay, but I didn't get nothing this time, figured it was okay."
10525,low_104,counsellor,"Well, I just want to ask you a question this time.  I want to ask you about the tobacco that you've been using, so what kind of tobacco product you use?"
10526,low_104,client,This is a loose leaf.
10527,low_104,counsellor,"Okay, like a chewing tobacco?"
10528,low_104,client,"Yes, ma'am."
10529,low_104,counsellor,So you used the last four weeks?
10530,low_104,client,I what?
10531,low_104,counsellor,You have been using the last four weeks?
10532,low_104,client,"Yeah, I've been using tobacco for the last four weeks.  Sixty years I've been doing that."
10533,low_104,counsellor,"Sixty years, have you been to the dentist to have them check your mouth?"
10534,low_104,client,I've got dentures.  I've had dentures ever since I was about  years old.
10535,low_104,counsellor,Do you see a dentist?
10536,low_104,client,"No, I don't go to a dentist."
10537,low_104,counsellor,So you have not seen a dentist for how many years?
10538,low_104,client,"Oh, shucks, I ain't seen a dentist since I had my teeth pulled out, I reckon.  That's probably - years ago."
10539,low_104,counsellor,"You're kidding me, really,  to  years ago, oh my gosh.  You're probably the only person I know that don't see the dentist."
10540,low_104,client,"If you've got dentures, what's the use of going to the dentist if you've got dentures?"
10541,low_104,counsellor,"Well, usually dentists will check your mouth.  Sometimes if you chew tobacco you have a chance that there might have some growth or something abnormal in your mouth and you don't know, you see."
10542,low_104,client,"Well, most of the time if I do, I usually tell, I can tell if something's maybe wrong with my mouth.  I usually take my dentures out and let them soak; I'll wash them up with warm salt water and stuff like that before I go to bed."
10543,low_104,counsellor,So you kind of take care of your mouth?
10544,low_104,client,Well sorta.  I think I've done pretty good.
10545,low_104,counsellor,But you only use the leaf tobacco; you're not smoking or anything.
10546,low_104,client,"No, I don't smoke; I never did take up the habit of smoking."
10547,low_104,counsellor,"But, how often do you chew tobacco a day?"
10548,low_104,client,All the time.
10549,low_104,counsellor,All day long?
10550,low_104,client,"All the time, all day long, all day long, from the time I get up, time I go to bed."
10551,low_104,counsellor,So how much does that cost you?
10552,low_104,client,"Um, this tobacco it probably cost me maybe $. a day."
10553,low_104,counsellor,"So basically, you're not planning on cutting down; you are just going to do the same thing?"
10554,low_104,client,"___________if it starts to gets to bothering me, I'd probably cut down."
10555,low_104,counsellor,Okay.
10556,low_104,client,"So far I have no problem.  I use to chew ______________ tobacco, back when they use to have ___________ tobacco, years ago, I use to, when I first started chewing I was chewing _____________."
10557,low_104,counsellor,Have you ever used any type of medication or any nicotine to try to stop chewing tobacco?
10558,low_104,client,"No, ma'am."
10559,low_104,counsellor,"No, okay."
10560,low_104,client,"No, ma'am.  I haven't found no reason to."
10561,low_104,counsellor,And your doctor knows about it that you chew tobacco?
10562,low_104,client,"Yes, yes, he does."
10563,low_104,counsellor,And you have not been checked with ultrasound or anything like that?  Have you ever had an abdominal aortic aneurysm test?  Probably not.
10564,low_104,client,"No, I don't think so."
10565,low_104,counsellor,"If you not see a dentist, I bet you."
10566,low_104,client,"No, I hardly ever been to a doctor.  I don't go to no dentist.  I don't go unless something bothers me.  If I get sick or something, I'll go to a doctor, as long as I stay healthy and able to work and get out here and go, I don't go see a doctor.  My wife, I tell you she goes sometimes two or three times a month."
10567,low_104,counsellor,Did your wife use any tobacco products?
10568,low_104,client,She smokes.
10569,low_104,counsellor,"She use to smoke, okay."
10570,low_104,client,"She smokes, smokes like a freight train."
10571,low_104,counsellor,"Well, you know, a lot of time just like, what's his name Georg Burns, I think he smoke or something all his life right, and, but even though she smoked you didn't want to smoke you just only want to chew?"
10572,low_104,client,"Well, yes.  I worked in the cigarette factory for  years?"
10573,low_104,counsellor,"Oh, you did."
10574,low_104,client,"Yeah, making cigarettes and I never did really take up the habit of smoking.  Yeah, all I done was chew tobacco."
10575,low_104,counsellor,"For  years, okay."
10576,low_104,client,"Yeah, well  years."
10577,low_104,counsellor,years.
10578,low_104,client,"The Reynolds Tobacco Company and I really didn't want to go to work then, but my wife made me."
10579,low_104,counsellor,"Well, your wife make you, how did she make you?"
10580,low_104,client,"Well, see I was working for myself and I was , about  years old when I work to work and I was doing some work for a guy and he was one of the big wheels at and he just asked me one day if I wanted to work and I told him no.  I was an outside person, I didn't want to work in a factory and I told my wife, and she said your crazy, she said you better go to work and get them benefits and insurance and all that, so I waited about two months and I went down and they hired me before I went out the door."
10581,low_104,counsellor,"Well, it is my job that I have to inform you about the risk of smoking or not smoking but chew tobacco the risk is to get a sore or ulcer in your mouth you may not know because sometimes it might start in some area that you cannot feel, okay.  So, but when in doubt you do see the doctor you can always go to that doctor that check your lab and have them see just to be sure whenever something happen, okay."
10582,low_104,client,"Yeah, whenever something happens I'll go."
10583,low_104,counsellor,"Yeah, and just to make sure that because you know why if early early detection is much better then when you do them late."
10584,low_104,client,I understand that.
10585,low_104,counsellor,"Because when I use to work at cancer hospital and I know that have a cancer in the mouth it just not a pleasant thing.  It affects a lot of eating and things like that, you know, and if probably you have cancer in the lungs, right, you can eat, but cancer in the mouth, it's just very difficult."
10586,low_104,client,Yup.
10587,low_104,counsellor,"I just want to let you know that at least check your mouth, if you don't want doctor check you can check it and then you can examine yourself, you know, do your, do your gargle and things like that to kind of keep, you know, keep, because I'm a nurse and I've seen it and I just think like oh, my gosh, you know, if you have something wrong in the mouth, it's probably the most devastating because we have to eat food and when you cannot food it makes it so difficult."
10588,low_104,client,"Well, if I didn't have to eat I wouldn't have to try to lose weight."
10589,low_104,counsellor,You have a problem with weight gain?
10590,low_104,client,"Not really, I usually stay about the same weight about all the time.  I'm somewhere around  to , somewhere along in there.  I gain more weight in the wintertime because I don't work as much.  I'm always sitting around and stuff like that, but in the summertime, I get out and work and sweat it all off and all that.  Most of the time, I usually lose a little bit of weight in the summertime."
10591,low_104,counsellor,"Yeah, and you play golf."
10592,low_104,client,"Yes, I play golf, but I haven't had much of a golf season this year.  I've been a working too hard."
10593,low_104,counsellor,"Well, and another thing, you know, you can think about because right now you use them all the time, you know, sometime even though you quit just a little bit or something like that it could help too.  So think about that okay and then I sure appreciate you calling I always enjoy talking to you.  You always have something to tell me like, you know, how, a lot of times people don't think about taking something to kind of help with your acid and stuff like that, you have a lot of knowledge in some way, the old fashion way."
10594,low_104,client,"Well, I guess that just comes from my family."
10595,low_104,counsellor,"From your family, did your family smoke?"
10596,low_104,client,"My family history and stuff like that, I don't know, I think my family was __________ like that.  They never did really get much sickness and stuff like that."
10597,low_104,counsellor,They work hard.
10598,low_104,client,"Yeah and always worked hard and stuff.  I can usually tell when I feel bad, if I feel bad, I usually try to work on myself for a few days and if I don't get better I go to the doctor."
10599,low_104,counsellor,"Yeah, in a lot of old days that's how people do it."
10600,low_104,client,Yeah.
10601,low_104,counsellor,"You know, you not depend on with a lot of medication like what we do now."
10602,low_104,client,"Yeah, I know it.  Back in the early 's people didn't go to the doctor hardley they used they're own remedies and stuff like that."
10603,low_104,counsellor,"A lot of old remedies back then, you know, that people do and people use."
10604,low_104,client,"Yeah, and I still use some of that.  I still drink my vinegar."
10605,low_104,counsellor,Your garlic and all that stuff.
10606,low_104,client,Yeah.
10607,low_104,counsellor,And you take niacin.
10608,low_104,client,That keeps me from going to a doctor.
10609,low_104,counsellor,"Yeah, and I think, you know, just have to kind of make some sense about this okay and then I will call you next time.  I'd like to ask you a question about your diabetes."
10610,low_104,client,"Diabetes, as far as I know, I reckon my diabetes is good.  I don't check it or nothing."
10611,low_104,counsellor,"Okay.  I have spoke to many people that they don't check too, it doesn't surprise me now when you say that.  But anyway, let me go ahead; look to see what day I can call you okay?"
10612,low_104,client,"Have you got the phone number to the house, the house phone?"
10613,low_104,counsellor,"Let me take a look to see what we have.  Well, the number I dial now what is this number?"

10622,low_104,client,"All right, more likely you'll probably catch me on that.  So if you're having bad weather you won't catch me on the cell phone."
