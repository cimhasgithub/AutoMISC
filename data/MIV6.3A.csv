1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,16,Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,17,I'm doing good and you?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,18,"I'm doing well, thank you! I appreciate you asking. So, what brought you in today?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,19,Concerning my smoking habit
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,20,Thank you for sharing that with me. What’s going on with your smoking habit that you’d like to explore today?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,21,I've been trying to quit
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,22,It sounds like quitting smoking is something that's important to you. What's been motivating that desire to quit?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,23,I don't want to get sick. Because of my health
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,24,Your health is really important to you. It's understandable that you want to protect it. What are some other things that are pushing you towards quitting?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,25,My wife
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,26,"Your wife plays an important role in your life, and it seems that her feelings or thoughts may be influencing your decision. How does she feel about your smoking, and how does that affect you?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,27,She's not feeling too good about it
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,28,I can see how that could be challenging. It seems like her feelings about your smoking might be adding to your motivation to quit. Can you share more about how that impacts your relationship with her?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,29,I love her so much and I don't want to do anything to hurt her
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,30,"It shows a lot about how much you care for her, and it's clear that her well-being is a priority for you. In thinking about quitting, you're considering not only your own health but also the impact on her. Are there specific ways in which quitting might improve things for both of you?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,31,Not really. Any ideas
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,32,"I’m happy to explore that with you if you’d like. Before I do, could you share any thoughts or ideas you have about what life might look like for you and your wife if you were to quit smoking?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,33,Quite boring but better
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,34,"It sounds like you see a picture of improvement in your lives, yet there's a concern about life becoming duller without smoking. Can you tell me more about what you mean by ""boring,"" and what ""better"" could look like for you both?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,35,"I love smoking, and I've been smoking since I was young, so its fun. But I'm going to live a better life. Good health"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,36,"You've got a lot of history with smoking, and it brings some enjoyment to your life. At the same time, you've got a vision of living a healthier, better life without it. Balancing those feelings must be tough. What do you imagine might replace that fun if you were to quit smoking?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,37,My wife attention
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,38,It sounds like gaining your wife's attention and enjoying a deeper connection with her is something meaningful for you. That could be a powerful source of motivation and fulfillment if you were to quit smoking. How do you think your relationship might change if you succeeded in quitting?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,39,It will be good one
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,40,"You envision a positive change in your relationship, making things even better between you two. That seems like a hopeful and motivating prospect. Knowing that possibility, what do you think your next steps might be?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,41,Give me some ideas
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,42,"Before we explore some ideas, is there anything else you'd like to discuss? We can also recap what we've talked about so far. Would you like a summary before we move forward?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,43,No
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,44,"All right. With your interest in improving your health and relationship, there are a few options to consider as steps forward. Would you like some suggestions on different approaches to quitting that others have found helpful?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,45,yes
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,46,Great! One approach could be setting a quit date as a commitment to yourself and your goals. Another option is looking into support groups or counseling to connect with others on a similar journey. There are also nicotine replacement therapies or medications available that might help ease the transition. How do any of these ideas resonate with you?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,47,A great one
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,48,That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like one or more of these options might be a good fit for you. Is there a particular approach you'd like to explore further or try first?
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,49,none
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,50,"That's completely okay. You know yourself best, and this is your journey. Whenever you're ready or if you have any questions later on, I'm here to support you. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,51,No
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,counsellor,52,"Thank you for our conversation today. To summarize, we talked about your desire to quit smoking for health reasons and the importance of your wife's feelings, which adds motivation to your journey. Although you've enjoyed the fun aspects of smoking from a young age, you envision a healthier, better life with a deeper connection with your wife. We explored some potential approaches, like setting a quit date, support groups, and treatments, though you're not ready to choose one yet. I'm here to support you whenever you're ready to explore these options further or talk about anything else.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
1,671fff4fced93c3e5a17f230,client,53,No
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,54,Hello! It’s great to have you here today. How has your day been so far?
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,55,Not bad. I just got up about an hour ago.
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,56,I hope you managed to get some good rest. Mornings can really set the tone for the day. How are you feeling about being here today?
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,57,"I'm actually feeling a bit hungry, and I might go make breakfast soon. Anyway, I feel good."
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,58,"I'm glad to hear you feel good about being here. And breakfast is always a great idea! Before you head to the kitchen, is there anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about today?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,59,"Nothing in particular, how about you?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,60,"I’m honestly here to listen to what’s on your mind. Sometimes talking about things can bring a lot of clarity, even if nothing specific is pressing. Do you feel like there are any habits or routines in your life that you're curious to explore during our time together?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,61,give me some ideas...
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,62,"Sure, we can delve into various aspects of life like your daily routines, any goals or changes you've been considering, or even habits like smoking that you might have mixed feelings about. Is there anything among these that catches your interest?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,63,"Well I would like to quit smoking, and have tried in the past, but obviously my success rate after 3+ attempts is low."
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,64,"Quitting smoking can be a challenging journey, especially after putting in so much effort. You’ve shown a lot of determination by trying multiple times, which is really commendable. What do you think kept you going even after facing those challenges?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,65,"What do you mean, why did I start again?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,66,I meant to reflect on the motivation behind your desire to quit and what gave you the push to try multiple times. Sometimes understanding what drives us can be inspiring. What do you think was behind your decision to quit those times?
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,67,"Ah... Well, mostly for health reasons. You know what congizant dissonance is like? Knowing something is bad, and still doing it? Also, the alleged chemical dependency aspect of it all."
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,68,"It sounds like you're caught in that challenging space where you’re aware of the health risks yet feeling the pull of both habit and dependency. It's a tough spot to be in, recognizing the harm and still finding yourself drawn to it. How does this inner conflict affect your daily life?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,69,"Well, money is tight right now so it affects my anxiety levels when I'mhoping I won't have to make a choice between something important, or another pack of cigarettes. But then when I buy a fresh pack"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,70,"It must be really challenging to feel that pressure between financial constraints and the urge to buy cigarettes. Anxiety around finances can make things even harder. When you do buy a pack, how do you feel in those moments?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,71,"It's like all those worries go away, but at the same time kind of lying to myself saying I'll quit after this one or ""soon"". It's mostly towards the end of a pack where the mini panic sets in."
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,72,"There's a sense of relief in the moment, almost like a temporary escape from the anxiety, and yet there’s also this underlying awareness and push to quit. It's understandable how that cycle can be tiring. What do you think makes the end of the pack bring up that mini panic for you?"
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,73,"I'd hate to have to go through an extended period of time without a cigarette, and really craving one."
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,74,The idea of facing that period without cigarettes—and the cravings that could come with it—sounds daunting. It's understandable to feel apprehensive about that discomfort. Have you noticed any moments or situations where the cravings aren’t as strong or are more manageable for you?
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,client,75,"hmmm, good question. I can't say for sure... Maybe when I'm really sick or something. Smoking when I have a sore throat and a dry mouth isn't the most pleasant."
2,6735337bd46a0b33a2bcf429,counsellor,76,"Thank you for sharing your time and thoughts today. We've reached the end of our session, and I’d like to take a moment to reflect on what we’ve discussed. You expressed a strong desire to quit smoking, driven by health concerns and financial strain. There’s this conflict of understanding the risks while still feeling the pull of habit and dependency, especially facing the anxiety of choosing between a new pack and other important needs. You've noted that cravings are less intense when you're not feeling well, which is interesting. These insights could be valuable stepping stones as you continue to explore reasons to quit. I appreciate your openness today, and whenever you’re ready to talk more, I’m here to support you on this journey. Take care, and I hope you have a good day ahead."
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,77,Hi there! I'm glad you could join me today. How are you doing? Anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about?
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,78,"Hello, I am feeling great right now!"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,79,That's great to hear! I'm glad you're feeling good. Is there anything you'd like to explore or talk about during our time together today?
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,80,I would like to talk about ways you  can help me to reduce the amount of cigarettes I smoke each day.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,81,"Of course, I'd be glad to help with that. It's great that you want to reduce your smoking. What has motivated you to think about cutting down on cigarettes?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,82,My age has triggered me to reduce the amount. I also cough alot.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,83,"You're noticing the impact smoking is having on your body, especially with the coughing, and you're considering your age as an important factor in wanting to make a change. It sounds like you're starting to weigh the benefits of reducing smoking for your health. What would you hope to gain from cutting back on cigarettes?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,84,I am hoping for better health overall.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,85,"Improving your health can have such a positive impact on your life. You're envisioning a healthier future for yourself, which is really motivating. What are some changes in your health you'd like to see as you start reducing smoking?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,86,I would like to see me more motivated to eat healthier and exercise more often.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,87,"It sounds like you're hoping that by smoking less, it could lead to a domino effect of positive changes in your life, like better nutrition and increased exercise. You're imagining a healthier, more active version of yourself. How do you think smoking less might influence those other areas of your life?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,88,Smoking less will help with breathing when I start to do more exercising like going for long walks up and down slopes or hills.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,89,Being able to breathe more easily during physical activities like walking up hills could make the experience more enjoyable and encourage you to be more active. You're connecting how reducing smoking could directly improve how you feel during exercise. What do you think might be some first steps you could take towards reducing your smoking?
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,90,"I could cut back on the amount of cigarettes I smoke each day. Possible reducing the number by 2 at first then as the weeks go on, I can reduce it by one more."
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,91,"Starting by cutting back a couple of cigarettes each day sounds like a thoughtful and manageable approach. You're making a realistic plan that allows for gradual change, which could make the process more sustainable for you. Are there specific times or situations where you feel most comfortable reducing those cigarettes?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,92,I feel that when I am less stressed I can manage the amount I smoke each day. It's when I get into stressful situations I tend to smoke more often.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,93,"Stressful situations seem to be closely tied to when you smoke more. You've noticed that when you're feeling relaxed, it's easier for you to manage your smoking. Understanding this pattern can really help as you look to cut back. How do you typically handle stress, and are there other strategies you might consider trying, in place of smoking, when stress arises?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,94,I manage stress by smoking. I also use breathing techniques and go for walks.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,95,"You have a couple of healthy strategies like breathing techniques and going for walks that help you manage stress, in addition to smoking. These are great tools you already have in place. How might you leverage them even more to support your goal of reducing smoking, especially in stressful times?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,96,I could set a regular schedule for myself to exercise maybe 3 to 4 days a weeks.
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,97,Setting a regular exercise schedule sounds like a strong step towards managing stress and supporting your goal to reduce smoking. Committing to a routine could offer consistency and a healthy outlet for stress. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore on this journey before we talk about any next steps?
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,98,no nothing
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,counsellor,99,"Thank you for our conversation today. We've talked about your motivation to reduce smoking due to concerns about your health and age, and how you're experiencing frequent coughing as a result of smoking. You expressed a desire for better overall health and hope for more motivation to eat healthier and exercise more. You linked cutting down on smoking with easier breathing during walks, especially up hills. You've considered a gradual reduction in smoking, by a couple of cigarettes each day, as a practical first step. We also discussed how smoking is a response to stress for you, yet you also use breathing techniques and walks to manage stress. Committing to a regular exercise schedule, perhaps three to four days a week, could support both stress relief and your goal of smoking less. If there's anything else you'd like to explore or if you're ready to talk about next steps when the time is right, I'm here for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
3,6481e7756969fcd48ea9c634,client,100,No
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,101,Hello! It's good to see you today. How are you feeling as we get started? I want to make sure you're comfortable and that this space is a supportive one for our conversation. Feel free to share anything that's on your mind.
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,102,hi I am good today how are you
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,103,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm really glad to hear you're having a good day. As we settle in, is there anything particular you'd like to focus on today, or would you like to start with just sharing a bit about your relationship with smoking? Whatever feels right for you."
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,104,I think I use smoking as a distraction when stressed
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,105,"Smoking seems like it's become a way for you to cope with stress. On one hand, it provides that temporary distraction or relief. I'm curious, though—how do you feel about that role smoking plays in your life?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,106,I hate it to be honest. I know it is bad for me and it will have long term health risks
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,107,"You're really aware of the negative impact smoking can have on your health in the long run, and it bothers you. It must be frustrating to feel stuck between needing a distraction and not wanting to cause harm to yourself. How does that make you feel about the possibility of making a change?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,108,I am determined to stop smoking
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,109,Your determination to quit smoking is really strong. That determination can be such a powerful ally in your journey. What do you think has contributed to this feeling of wanting to make a change now?
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,110,wanting not to risk my health for the sake of my family. I want to be around for them as long as what I can be
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,111,"Your family truly means a lot to you, and their well-being is a big motivator for wanting to quit smoking. You want to be there for them as long as possible, and taking care of your health is a way to do that. It's heartening to see that your motivation is so deeply connected to the love and care you have for them. Is there anything else that comes to mind when you think about making this change?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,112,It is just better for my health as well as financially
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,113,"So, quitting smoking holds benefits for you both in terms of health and finances. It's a change that could positively impact several areas of your life. You're looking at it from a holistic perspective, considering both your well-being and practical aspects. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about, or are you ready to consider some next steps together?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,114,i would like to consider the next steps
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,115,"Great! Let’s take a moment to reflect on what we’ve discussed. You've shared how smoking serves as a stress distraction, but it also brings frustration due to health concerns. Your family is a big motivator, as you want to ensure you're there for them, and quitting would also benefit your health and finances. 

With all that in mind, would it be okay if we explore some possible steps you might take to work towards quitting smoking?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,116,yes that would be fine
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,117,"Thank you for that. As you think about quitting smoking, what ideas or steps have come to mind that you think might help you get started on this journey?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,118,just sheer will power
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,119,"Sheer willpower is a really strong foundation to build upon, and it shows your determination. Alongside that inner strength, sometimes having additional tools or support can make the journey a bit easier. Are there any other approaches or resources you might consider to support your willpower, like a support group, counseling, or nicotine replacement options?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,120,nicotine patches maybe
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,121,"Nicotine patches could definitely be a useful tool to help ease the transition as you work towards quitting smoking. They release a steady, controlled amount of nicotine to help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, while you're still working towards your goal. Is there anything specific you would like to know about using patches, or anything else you'd like to explore as part of your next steps?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,122,I am not sure
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,123,"That's completely okay. Taking it one step at a time can be helpful, and it's perfectly normal to have some uncertainties along the way. We can explore your options further as you feel ready. In the meantime, you’re welcome to reach out whenever you have questions or when you feel like discussing this more. Is there anything specific you’d like to focus on, or any support you feel would be helpful right now as you consider your next steps?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,124,how many attempts does it on average take a person before they quit
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,125,"It's common for people to make several attempts before they successfully quit smoking for good. On average, it might take multiple tries, as many people use each attempt to learn more about their triggers, how to better manage cravings, and what strategies work best for them. The important part is that each attempt can bring you closer to your goal. How do you feel about taking this journey, even if it might take some tries to get there?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,126,ok
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,127,"It's great that you're open to the journey, even if it involves some steps along the way. It's all part of the process as you work toward your goal. Remember, each effort is a step forward. Whenever you want to talk or need support, I'm here. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to explore?"
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,client,128,nothing i can think off at present
4,5bbb5e3f118c0600013c3202,counsellor,129,"Thank you for our conversation today. I'd like to summarize what we've talked about. You’ve shared that smoking acts as a way to cope with stress but also leaves you feeling frustrated due to its negative impact on your health. You’re especially motivated by your desire to stay healthy for your family, as well as the financial benefits of quitting. We explored how using willpower is a key part of your plan, and discussed nicotine patches as a potential support tool. You've expressed readiness to undertake this journey for your well-being and that of your loved ones. If you think of anything else or need support on this path, please know that I’m here for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,133,"It's good to hear you're okay. Thank you for being here today. I'm here to support you, especially with anything you might be feeling uncertain about right now. Is there anything about your smoking habits or anything else you'd like to discuss today?"

5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,135,"That's perfectly fine. We can take things one step at a time. If there's anything on your mind, feel free to bring it up whenever you're ready. In the meantime, would you mind sharing a little about your experience with smoking? No pressure; just whatever you're comfortable with."
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,136,"ive smoked since 18 im 41 now, i like smoking"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,137,That's quite a long journey with smoking. It sounds like it's something you find enjoyable. What is it about smoking that you like?
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,138,it relaxes me and theres nothing better than a smoke after eating or sex
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,139,"It sounds like smoking has become a way for you to unwind, especially during those moments that you find satisfying. Smoking seems to be tied to some of your daily routines. Are there any other moments or situations where you notice smoking playing a role in your life?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,140,stress
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,141,"It seems like smoking has become a tool for managing stress as well. It’s understandable how it could feel like a moment of calm amidst chaos. How do you feel about its role in helping you deal with stress? Do you find it effective, or are there any mixed feelings about it?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,142,it helps
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,143,"It seems that smoking is a reliable way for you to find some relief and cope with stress. That's really important. While it helps, are there any downsides or concerns you've noticed about smoking in your life?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,144,usual stuff smell etc
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,145,"It sounds like the common downsides like the smell are noticeable to you, even though smoking helps in other ways. Balancing these benefits and downsides can be difficult at times. Is there anything else about smoking that you'd like to talk about today?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,146,arent u supposed to help me quit?
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,147,"I'm here to support you in exploring your feelings about smoking and help you find your own path forward. If quitting is something you'd like to discuss, we can certainly talk about that together. How do you feel about the idea of quitting or cutting back on smoking right now?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,148,scared
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,149,"Thank you for sharing that. Feeling scared is a very natural reaction, especially when thinking about making a change. It's understandable considering how smoking has been a part of your life for so long. What fears or concerns come up for you when you think about quitting or cutting back?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,150,im a nervous person always have been
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,151,"It seems like smoking has been a way to manage some of those nervous feelings over the years. That makes a lot of sense if it's been a source of comfort for you. When you think about change, what would reassure you or make it feel safer?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,152,i dont know any suggestions?
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,153,"We can explore some ideas together if you're open to it. Before we jump into that, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss first?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,154,"no, id just like some ideas/suggestions"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,155,"Great, I appreciate your openness to explore some ideas. From what we've talked about, smoking is closely tied to relaxation and managing stress. We could think about finding small ways to introduce other calming activities or routines that might give you that similar sense of relaxation. 

Would it be alright if we explore different options that have worked for others, and see if anything resonates with you?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,156,yes please
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,157,"Some people have found activities like deep breathing exercises, short walks, or even listening to music helpful for relaxation. Others enjoy finding a hobby that keeps their hands busy, like drawing or puzzles. Since you mentioned that you're a nervous person, setting up a calming routine or environment could also help. How do these ideas sound to you? Any that you think could potentially fit into your lifestyle?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,158,i have a routine already
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,159,"Having a routine is great. Sometimes weaving in small changes or additions can make a difference, especially if it aligns with what you're already used to. Is there any part of your current routine where you feel it might be easiest to try something new? If you could envision a small change, what might it look like for you?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,160,i was wondering about things that could help with withdrawel?
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,161,"I appreciate you bringing that up. Withdrawal can indeed be challenging, and preparing for it is wise. Some people find that using nicotine replacement therapies such as patches or gum helps to ease the transition. These can provide nicotine in a safer way while you work on adjusting your habits.

Others find support groups or speaking with friends or family helpful during this time. What do you think about these options? Is there one that might make withdrawal feel a bit more manageable for you?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,162,nicotine replacement-whats the techniques used?
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,163,"Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) are designed to help by giving your body a lower dose of nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in cigarettes. They come in various forms like patches, gum, lozenges, or even inhalers and nasal sprays. These can be used to gradually reduce your nicotine intake, which can help with withdrawal symptoms.

Typically, people start with a higher dose matching their current nicotine levels and then slowly decrease it over time. Some combine NRT with behavioral changes or counseling for more support. It might be useful to discuss these options with a healthcare professional to determine what fits best for you.

Does this approach sound like something you'd consider exploring further?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,164,yeah maybe
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,165,It’s great that considering nicotine replacement as a possibility feels okay for you. It's normal to take time to decide what feels right. Is there any other information or support you feel you might need as you think about next steps?
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,166,"its the wobbly jitters i fear, would this help with that?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,167,"Many people find that nicotine replacement can help reduce those jitters by providing a steadier, controlled amount of nicotine to the body. The idea is to minimize those intense withdrawal symptoms while you transition. Everyone's experience is unique, so finding the right type and dosage would be important. Does knowing that it could help with the jitters make you feel more at ease with considering it?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,168,oh yes
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,169,I'm glad to hear that. Feeling a bit more at ease can certainly make the process less daunting. We've covered a lot today about your relationship with smoking and some potential paths forward. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up for now?
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,170,no youve helped a lot thanks
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,counsellor,171,"Thank you for the conversation today. I'd like to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. 

You've shared that you've been smoking for quite some time, and it provides a sense of relaxation and stress relief for you, particularly in moments after meals and during stressful times. While you enjoy smoking, there are typical downsides like the smell that you're aware of. We explored your thoughts on quitting, and feelings of nervousness and fear you associate with change.

You expressed interest in nicotine replacement therapies as a potential way to manage withdrawal symptoms, especially the fear of feeling jittery, and we discussed how these therapies might provide relief by delivering a steady amount of nicotine. You mentioned that understanding this option more made you feel more at ease. 

I'm here to support you as you consider your next steps, and I'm glad that reflecting on these options has been helpful. If there's anything more you'd like to delve into another time, feel free to reach out.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
5,6127b32b912465823dca1e4b,client,172,No
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,173,"Hello! How are you doing today? I'm really glad you chose to spend some time here. Shall we start by talking a bit about how things have been going for you lately? Whatever's on your mind, feel free to share."
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,174,"Things are gong well, I am enjoying work and finding my footing in London"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,175,It sounds like you're settling in and enjoying your work. Adjusting to a new city can be both exciting and challenging. How are you finding life in London overall? Is there anything in particular that you’re adjusting to?
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,176,Adusting to working fultime now I've left uni. Its good but chalenging
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,177,"Moving from university to full-time work is a big transition. It's great to hear you're finding some positives in it, even though it can be challenging at times. What have you been enjoying in the new routine, and what are some of the challenges you've been facing?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,178,"I am enjoying haveing a set time to my days, the consistancy! Though I love to socialise which I o outside of work but it means i do burn myself out alot"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,179,"Having a routine can really help provide that sense of structure, while socializing brings energy and joy. Balancing both, however, can lead to feeling burnt out. How do you usually handle things when you notice you're getting burned out?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,180,I sleep. Or try and keep some time to myself
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,181,"Finding time to recharge through sleep and solitude sounds like a thoughtful approach. Balancing social life and work can be tricky. Have you noticed any habits or routines, besides socializing, that play into how you're feeling about stress or burnout, perhaps more related to your lifestyle?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,182,yeah i think smoking and drining can affect me too as it makes me more tired
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,183,Smoking and drinking can definitely affect energy levels and contribute to feeling tired. It sounds like you're aware of their impact on you. What are your thoughts on smoking and how it fits into your life right now?
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,184,i have done it for a while but i dont enjoy having to rely on it. I only really enjoy it when im drinking
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,185,"It seems like smoking has become a habitual part of your life, even though there's an underlying desire to not depend on it. It brings enjoyment in certain social settings, but it sounds like you have mixed feelings about that reliance. What are some of the things you like and dislike about smoking?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,186,i like the socialness of it and also my grndad used to smoke so i do do it to remind me of him sometimes
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,187,"Smoking holds a social value for you and carries a sentimental connection to your grandfather, which makes it meaningful in a way. On the other side, the reliance seems to be something you might not be completely comfortable with. Have you ever thought about what life might look like without this reliance, or is it something you're not ready to consider just yet?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,188,i have considered it and id lie to be stronger to prove to myself i can quit
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,189,"The idea of proving to yourself that you can quit shows a strong desire for strength and self-empowerment. This could be a step toward exploring change if it's something you're thinking about more often. Is there anything else about smoking that's on your mind, or any other feelings around this topic you'd like to talk about today?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,190,what would be your firts stepsin advice fr stopping
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,191,"I appreciate you asking about that, and it's great that you're interested in exploring this further. Before we dive into any advice, I'd like to summarize what we've talked about to make sure we're on the same page.

We've discussed how you're enjoying your new work routine and the social aspects of your life in London, despite the challenges of balancing it all. Smoking seems to be something you associate with social life and memories of your grandfather, but there's also a sense of wanting to not rely on it so much. You've considered what quitting might mean for your personal strength and empowerment.

If it’s all right with you, would you like to explore some potential steps for change?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,192,yes!
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,193,"Great! It's wonderful you're open to exploring some steps without feeling rushed. One approach people often find helpful is to start with identifying specific moments or reasons that motivate them to quit, like the desire for more energy or proving their strength. 

Would you like to start by talking about any particular motivations or changes you're looking to see in your life by reducing or stopping smoking?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,194,"i would like o be healthily and breathe better. i find that i think im orally fixated. i chew thing, my nails etc so smoking is probab;y fu;filling that desire too"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,195,"Aiming for better health and breathing are really strong motivators, and recognizing the role of oral fixation is insightful. Some people find it helpful to address that by finding a substitute that satisfies that need, like chewing gum or using a stress ball.

Would exploring strategies that might support these goals and desires be something you're interested in?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,196,yes
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,197,"Wonderful! Let's take a look at some strategies that could align with what you're hoping to achieve. Since breathing and health are priorities, finding alternatives to smoking that also address your oral fixation can be key. 

Some options might include:
- Trying sugar-free gum or healthy snacks like carrot sticks to keep your mouth busy.
- Exploring relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises, which can help when you feel the urge to smoke and improve your lung health.
- Gradually reducing the amount you smoke each day to ease into the process.

Would any of these ideas feel like a good fit to start with, or are there other alternatives you've thought about trying?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,198,"i think gum etc would be a good start, i dont mind myself having a cheeky cig whrn i drink s i do enjoy it. i just want to stop the daily habit"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,199,"Starting with gum or other similar alternatives sounds like a practical option, especially for addressing that daily habit. Enjoying a cigarette socially when drinking, while reducing daily smoking, seems like a step toward finding a balance you're comfortable with.

Would you like to think about setting any specific goals for how you might incorporate these changes into your daily routine, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss or plan?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,200,i think maybe limitiig to like one or two a day woud be a good first step
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,201,"Limiting yourself to one or two cigarettes a day sounds like a realistic and manageable first step. It can provide some reassurance that change is possible without feeling too overwhelming. 

Would it be helpful to set a target date to start this, or would you rather approach it more flexibly? Also, if any challenges come up in this process, know that I'd be here to support you in navigating them."
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,202,thanks! yeah lets set a date
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,203,Setting a date can give you a clear starting point and something to aim for. How about choosing a day within the next week that feels right for you to begin this change? Think about a time when you feel ready and supported to take on this new step.
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,204,perhaps sunday
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,205,"Sunday sounds like a great choice. It can be a good day to reflect and prepare for the week ahead. As you move towards this goal, remember that small, consistent steps can lead to meaningful change. 

Is there anything else you'd like to plan, or any other concerns about this process you'd like to talk through before Sunday arrives?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,206,i dont think so!
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,counsellor,207,"Thank you for spending this time talking with me today. I’d like to summarize what we’ve discussed so far. You shared how you're adjusting to life in London and enjoying your new work routine, though balancing work and social life can sometimes lead to burnout. Alongside this, smoking plays a role in your life, both socially and sentimentally, though you have a desire to gain more control over it. You've expressed a motivation to improve your health and breathing by reducing your daily smoking habit. You've chosen Sunday as a day to start limiting your smoking to one or two cigarettes a day, while considering alternatives like gum to help address the oral fixation. You've taken thoughtful steps toward change, and I'm here to support you as you move forward. If anything else comes up, feel free to reach out. Take care!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
6,60dde1621f6e206dea63a7dd,client,208,No
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,209,Hello! I'm so glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now?
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,210,I am feeling fine.
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,211,That's great to hear. I'm here to explore anything on your mind that you'd like to discuss. We can talk about smoking and how it fits into your life if that's something you're open to. What's been your experience with that lately?
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,212,I've been smoking for about 11 years now. I smoke on average around 10 cigarettes a day.
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,213,"That's a long time, and it sounds like smoking has been a part of your routine. I'm curious, what are some things you like about smoking, and what are some things you might not like as much?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,214,"I like that it basically gives me a break from whatever I was doing and whatever was on my mind, it gives me a chance to clear my head. I don't like that I have to spend money on cigarettes."
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,215,"Taking a moment to pause and clear your mind with a cigarette sounds like a benefit for you. At the same time, the financial cost is something you're not happy about. It seems like there's a balance between what smoking offers you and the drawbacks it brings. How do you feel about that balance at the moment?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,216,I'm fine with the balance. I spend less money on other things to make up for the cost of cigarettes.
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,217,"You've adjusted your expenses in other areas to accommodate for cigarettes, which shows how you've managed to maintain this balance. It’s understandable how these trade-offs might work for you. Has there been anything that's made you reconsider this balance or think about the role smoking plays in your life?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,218,"On the positive side, I also like the relaxing feeling cigarettes give me. On the negative side, of course there are health risks associated with smoking."
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,219,"The relaxation you get from smoking is clearly significant for you. At the same time, the potential health risks are on your mind. It's like there's a tug-of-war between the immediate comfort and the long-term concerns. How do you find yourself navigating those thoughts and feelings?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,220,I don't really give it much thought. It's become sort of a routine by now to smoke.
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,221,"Smoking has become a routine for you, something that you do almost automatically. It’s understandable that it might not always be on your mind. Do you ever notice moments when that routine is challenged or where you find yourself questioning it, even a little bit?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,222,"Yes. If I can't smoke for whatever reason, I do get a craving for one. I also do think of the possible negative health consequences from time to time."
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,223,"It makes sense that cravings would pop up when you can't smoke, and the health consequences sometimes come to mind. These moments of craving and concern seem like they might add layers to your relationship with smoking. How do you usually handle those cravings or thoughts about health when they surface?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,224,"If I can't smoke at that moment I usually just try to get my mind off of the idea. In regards to the thoughts of health, I also just try not to think about it."
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,225,"Distracting yourself from cravings and trying not to dwell on health thoughts seem like strategies you use to navigate those challenges. It takes resilience to manage those feelings when they arise. Have there been times when you've thought about making any changes, or is staying with your routine more comfortable for now?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,226,"Where I am at right now in my life, I couldn't see myself quitting just yet. I am at a sort of stressful point in my life and smoking aids that. However, I would like to quit eventually."
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,227,"Right now, smoking provides some relief during a stressful time, and it seems like it's helping you manage that stress. It's also clear that there's a part of you that envisions a future where quitting is possible. How do you visualize that future, when the time comes that quitting might feel right for you?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,228,"I think that when I am financially secure, have a good stable job and if I am raising a family that I would like to quit at that point."
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,229,"Imagining a future where quitting aligns with financial security, career stability, and family life paints a promising picture for you. It's a time when you see things coming together in a way that supports making a change. Though you're not ready to quit right now, having that vision shows you're already thinking about what you want for yourself. Is there anything you'd like to talk about or explore around this vision or your current routine today?"
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,client,230,"The vision for quitting would be that once I feel i'm in a less stressful phase of my life, I will cut down the number of cigarettes per day slowly, and eventually entirely quit them."
7,663b79f76293a4480abba57d,counsellor,231,"Thank you so much for spending time with me today. We've reached a natural point to wrap up, and I'd like to take a moment to summarize what we've talked about. 

We explored your smoking routine and how it's been a part of your life for about 11 years, providing both a mental break and a relaxing feeling. You've also been mindful of the financial cost and health risks associated with smoking. Right now, during a stressful phase, smoking seems to offer some comfort. But there's a vision you hold for the future: a time when you're financially secure, stable in your job, and possibly raising a family, which includes slowly cutting down cigarettes and eventually quitting. 

This vision, while not immediately actionable, reflects a thoughtful approach to how you might navigate change when the timing feels right for you. Please feel free to reach out whenever you'd like to explore more, and I’m here to support you along the way. 

Take care, and I look forward to our next conversation if that feels right for you."
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,232,Hi there! I'm really glad you've taken the time to chat today. How have you been feeling lately?
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,233,ive been feeling abit low on energy and motivation
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,234,I'm sorry to hear that. Feeling low on energy and motivation can be really challenging. Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you lately?
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,235,"I have alot of things happening currently in my life,my family is pressuring me into quitting smoking and my health hasnt been that good for the past few weeks"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,236,"It sounds like there's a lot weighing on you right now, both with family expectations and some health concerns. Can you share a bit more about how you're feeling about your smoking at the moment?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,237,"I honestly cant function without a smoke,its too much."
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,238,"It seems like smoking has become a significant part of your daily routine, like a way to cope with everything else going on. Balancing that dependency with the pressure from your family and worries about your health must feel overwhelming. What are your thoughts about those moments when you reach for a cigarette?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,239,I feel ecstatic beacuse i finally get to quench my cigarrete thirst
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,240,"That moment of relief and satisfaction is quite powerful, isn't it? It sounds like smoking provides you with a sense of immediate gratification when you're feeling that urge. At the same time, I wonder if there's another part of you that feels differently about smoking or the role it plays in your life. Would you like to talk more about that?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,241,"Yes,as much as smoking gives me an amzing satisfaction,at some point i feel bad because i know its hindering my health and makes my friends and family sad"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,242,There's a real conflict between the immediate satisfaction smoking provides and the guilt or concern about its impact on your health and your loved ones. It must be tough to feel that tug-of-war between enjoyment and the consequences. How do you tend to manage these mixed feelings when they arise?
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,243,"I promise myself to reduce the rate at which i smoke,sometimes even throw away the remaining cigarettes"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,244,"That shows real determination and an awareness of wanting to change. At times, it sounds like you're willing to take steps to address the conflict you feel about smoking. What do you notice happens after you make those promises or throw away cigarettes?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,245,"I fight the urge for sometime,but end up not winning,i sometimes sleep to avoid feeling the urge of smoking"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,246,"It takes a lot of strength to fight those urges, and it's understandable that it can be exhausting to maintain that resistance over time. Using sleep as a strategy to cope shows a creative way to push through the craving. What do you think would need to happen for you to feel more confident in managing these urges in the future?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,247,Not having access to cigarettes
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,248,"Not having cigarettes accessible seems like it might help you feel more in control of those urges. It sounds like the environment plays a big role in how you navigate these cravings. Is this something you'd like to explore further, perhaps thinking about ways to create an environment that supports the changes you want to make?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,249,"Yes,ive been thinking if theres also a support group for cigarette addict"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,250,"You're thinking ahead about seeking support, which can be a powerful step. Support groups provide a community and understanding for people going through similar challenges. Would you like to look into what options might be available to connect with others who are also aiming to quit or reduce smoking?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,251,its hard though
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,252,It's completely valid to feel that way. Reaching out for support can be intimidating and it's not always easy to take that first step. You're really showing a lot of courage just by considering it. What do you think might help make it feel a bit more manageable or less overwhelming for you?
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,253,"i honestly dont know,ive been really trying"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,254,"It sounds like you've been putting in a lot of effort, and you're in a challenging spot right now. It takes time to work through all these feelings and decisions. Is there anything else you'd like to share or talk through today that might help in finding a way forward that feels right for you?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,255,"yes,i feel bad for getting to this point especially coz im a female,"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,256,"It's really tough to carry those feelings of guilt or disappointment, especially when you're feeling pressure related to your identity. You are not alone in this, and it takes a lot of bravery to acknowledge where you are and want something different. What do you wish you could express to someone who truly understands what you're going through?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,257,"That i really want to reduce my cigarette,im trying so much..i know i cant do it once,till take some time"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,258,"Acknowledging that desire to reduce your smoking and recognizing the effort you're putting in is really important. It's a journey that may take time, and you deserve to give yourself credit for the steps you're taking, even if they're small. How might you support yourself or remind yourself of this commitment you've voiced?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,259,do you have any suggestions
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,260,Thank you for asking for suggestions. Would it be okay if we talked about some possibilities together?
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,261,yes please
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,262,"Thank you for letting me share some ideas. Based on what we've discussed, some people find it helpful to set small, achievable goals and to celebrate those successes along the way. Keeping a journal or recording your thoughts about your journey might also help clarify your feelings and progress. Connecting with others, either through a support group or someone you trust, can offer encouragement and understanding. How do any of these ideas resonate with you?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,263,"journaling sounds good,i can get a book,also need someone to talk to,who wont judge me and will understand me"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,264,"Journaling can be a wonderful way to express your thoughts and track your progress. Having someone to talk to who provides understanding and non-judgmental support can make a big difference as well. Is there someone in your life who you feel comfortable reaching out to, or would exploring support groups or counselling options feel like a good step for finding that understanding connection?"
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,client,265,okay ill try support groups and seee
8,67336dc4beb89674ca687d87,counsellor,266,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. Our conversation has reached the intended length, so let me go over what we've discussed. You've shared feeling low on energy and some pressure from your family about quitting smoking, alongside concerns about your health. We've explored the immediate satisfaction smoking provides for you, as well as the challenges and mixed emotions you encounter around it. You revealed how you've tried managing those urges, even by setting promises to yourself and throwing away cigarettes. 

We talked about the impact of your environment and the idea of accessing support groups, and you've expressed a real commitment to reducing smoking, even though acknowledging it might take time. Additionally, you mentioned that journaling could be a helpful tool, and reaching out to someone who understands you is important. You've decided to explore support groups as a potential way to connect with others who can offer understanding and encouragement.

Thank you for your openness today. If there's anything else you're considering or need support with, I'm here to help. Would you like to schedule another session to continue this conversation?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,267,Hello there! I'm really glad you could make it today. How are you feeling about being here and starting this conversation?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,268,I'm a bit hesitant but alright
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,269,"It's completely okay to feel hesitant. This is a space for you to share whatever you're comfortable with. When you think about your smoking, what comes to mind?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,270,I think of hopelessness and a hard habit to quit
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,271,That sounds really tough—feeling like it's a cycle that's difficult to break. It seems like there might be a part of you that wants to see a change but feels stuck. Could you tell me more about those feelings of hopelessness?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,272,It just feels so hard to quit even though rationally it should be easy
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,273,"It sounds like there's a disconnect between what you know and how challenging the habit feels emotionally. On one hand, you recognize that quitting would be the logical choice, but on the other, it feels like a significant struggle. What do you think makes it feel so difficult to quit?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,274,The cravings are too strong
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,275,"Those cravings can really feel overpowering, almost like they have a pull that's difficult to resist, even if you're aware of the reasons to quit. When you experience cravings, how do you usually handle them?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,276,I typically try to distract myself but that hardly works that well
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,277,"It seems like you're making an effort to manage those cravings by trying different strategies, even if they don't always provide the relief you're hoping for. It must be frustrating when the distractions don't work as well as you'd like. How do you feel about the fact that you're still trying different ways to cope with the cravings?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,278,Absolutely. I feel unsure. I don't know where to start and I don't know what advice is good
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,279,"Feeling unsure about where to start and what advice to follow is completely normal, especially when faced with so much information and the weight of those cravings. It's clear you're seeking a path that will work best for you. What aspects of your life make you think that quitting smoking could be beneficial?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,280,"Definitely. My health, my exercise, my family. My smoking is detrimental to just about everything"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,281,"It sounds like you're recognizing how smoking impacts important areas of your life—your health, your ability to exercise, and your relationship with your family. Those are significant reasons that many people find important. What changes do you envision in these aspects of your life if you were to quit smoking?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,282,I guess you're right..I would be able to be healthier for myself and others. I would be less shameful as well
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,283,"Imagining yourself healthier, with less shame, can be a powerful vision. Being healthier for both yourself and others holds a lot of meaning. This must create a sense of motivation and hope in you amidst the difficulties. Is there anything else you're thinking about in terms of the benefits that quitting smoking might bring?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,284,"I mean yeah.. cost savings,, time savings.. better exercise performance"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,285,"Saving money and time, along with seeing better results in exercise, are substantial benefits, and it's great that you're considering all these aspects. It sounds like you've been doing some important thinking about the positives that could come from change. Is there anything else you want to explore or talk about today?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,286,Nothing that comes to mind no
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,287,"Thank you for sharing so much with me today; I really appreciate the conversation. We explored your feelings of hopelessness around quitting smoking and the powerful cravings that make the habit so challenging to break. Despite these difficulties, we discussed the different reasons you've considered quitting, such as improving your health, saving money and time, enhancing exercise performance, and being healthier for your family, which seem very important to you. You also shared how quitting could help you feel less shame and more fulfilled overall. This conversation shows your awareness of the benefits and your thoughtful consideration of the things that matter most in your life. Please feel free to reach out if you ever want to continue exploring these thoughts.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,288,"Yes, let's continue."
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,289,"Great! If you're thinking about taking a step towards change, we can explore what that might look like for you. How do you feel about discussing some potential small steps you could take toward reducing or quitting smoking?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,290,I would love to!
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,291,Wonderful! Let's take a look at some possibilities that feel right for you. What small step do you think might be the most achievable for you to start with on this journey?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,292,Maybe I could cut down?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,293,Cutting down on smoking seems like a manageable first step for you. It's a way to start changing your routine while still maintaining some control over the pace of that change. Do you have any thoughts on how you might begin to reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke each day?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,294,Maybe stretching each smoke break a bit longer from the prior one
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,295,Stretching the time between each smoke break is a thoughtful approach. It gives you space to gradually adjust to smoking less without diving into a huge change all at once. How confident do you feel about experimenting with this method and seeing how it works for you?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,296,i feel rather confident.. one way to find out i guess haha
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,297,"It's great to hear you're feeling confident about trying this approach. Sometimes taking that first step, even if it's experimenting, can reveal a lot about what works for you. As you try stretching the time between smoke breaks, remember that each small success is a meaningful step forward. Would you like to talk about any support or resources that might help you along the way?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,298,yes. what are some good resources?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,299,"There are several resources that many people find helpful when they're working on reducing or quitting smoking. Here are a few options you might consider:

1. **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who are on a similar journey can provide encouragement and understanding. You might find local groups or online communities beneficial.

2. **Quitlines:** Many places offer free telephone counseling services, like the national quitline in various countries, where you can get support and information.

3. **Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT):** Options like patches, gum, or lozenges can help manage cravings, though it's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional before deciding.

4. **Mobile Apps:** There are apps designed to support quitting smoking by tracking your progress and providing motivation.

5. **Counseling:** Working with a counselor or therapist trained in smoking cessation can offer personalized strategies and support.

Would any of these resources be something you'd like to know more about or consider?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,300,I will definitely look into mobile apps. any good ones?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,301,"Mobile apps can be great tools for support. Some popular ones that people find useful include:

1. **Smoke Free:** This app helps track the money you save, health improvements, and offers daily missions to keep you motivated.

2. **Quit Genius:** Offers personalized plans with cognitive behavioral therapy techniques and community support.

Feel free to explore these and see which one resonates with you the most. They can offer extra motivation and track your progress, making the journey a bit easier. If you try one and like it, I'd love to hear how it works for you."
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,302,Are they all free?
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,303,"Many of these apps offer free versions with essential features, while some also offer premium versions with additional features for a fee. It's a good idea to start by exploring the free version to see if it aligns with what you're looking for. You can always explore the premium options later if you find the app particularly helpful. Does that sound like a plan?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,304,it does! thank you for your help.
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,305,"You're very welcome! I'm glad we could have this conversation, and I'm here to support you whenever you need. Remember, every small step is progress. Take care, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to talk again. Wishing you the best on this journey!"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,306,thanks.
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,counsellor,307,"Thank you for the conversation today. Here's a summary of what we discussed:

We talked about how, despite the difficulty, you see many reasons to quit, like improving your health, exercise performance, saving money and time, and being healthier for your family, which are truly important to you.

We discussed trying to stretch the time between each smoke break as a small, manageable step towards reducing your smoking, and you mentioned feeling confident about trying this approach out. Then, we explored some resources like mobile apps, support groups, quitlines, nicotine replacement therapy, and counseling, with you showing interest in checking out some smoking cessation apps.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
9,5f5e32a0d6a12c6857b8e127,client,308,No
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,309,Hi there! It's really nice to meet you today. How's your day going so far?
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,310,Pretty good
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,311,"I'm glad to hear that. Since you're feeling good, it might be a good time to talk about what brought you in today. What would you like to focus on during our session?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,312,yes
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,313,Great! We can start wherever you feel comfortable. Tell me a bit about your thoughts on smoking and how it fits into your life right now.
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,314,i smoke 5 times a day. always need to have my morning smoke as soon as 30 mins from waking up. i want to stop but it has been very hard
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,315,"You're smoking about five times a day, with a strong pull for that morning cigarette. It sounds like you're feeling stuck between your desire to quit and the difficulty of actually doing it. You're here because you want to stop smoking, and yet, it's been a real challenge. What makes you want to quit smoking?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,316,my kids and overall health
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,317,"Your kids and your health are really important to you, and they motivate you to think about quitting. It's a big commitment, caring for both your family and yourself. How does smoking impact the life you want for yourself and your kids?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,318,i do not want the risk of them potentially losing a parent over smoking
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,319,You're really concerned about your role as a parent and the long-term implications smoking could have on your family. Wanting to be around for your kids and ensuring they don't face the risk of losing a parent is a powerful motivator. How do you imagine life would be different for both you and your kids if smoking wasn't a part of it?
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,320,better. nothing to be worried about health wise and save that money too
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,321,"Envisioning a life with better health and financial savings, free from the worries associated with smoking, seems meaningful for you. It's as if quitting could open up more opportunities for you and your family. What would be the first sign for you that things are improving once you take steps towards quitting?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,322,feeling cleaner and having my kids feel proud
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,323,"Feeling cleaner and having your kids' pride are such strong, personal rewards for you. These achievements seem to be very meaningful and motivating for you. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore regarding smoking and your journey toward quitting?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,324,how can i stop falling back
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,325,"That's an important question, and it shows you're thinking about making lasting changes. We can certainly explore strategies that might help you feel more secure in your decision to quit. Could I share some ideas with you on managing triggers and staying on track?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,326,ok
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,327,"Wonderful. From our conversation, there are a few things we might consider to support your journey:

1. **Identifying Triggers**: Recognizing the times and situations when you're most likely to want to smoke. Once identified, we could look at ways to change your environment or responses.

2. **Coping Strategies**: Developing new habits or activities to replace smoking. This could be something small, like going for a walk or having a water bottle handy.

3. **Support System**: Surrounding yourself with people who encourage your quit journey, like family or support groups.

4. **Celebrating Small Wins**: Acknowledging each small step you make toward quitting, like cutting back on a cigarette or two, or going through part of the day without smoking.

Does any of this resonate with you, or is there a particular area you'd like to look deeper into?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,328,im scared the feeling will itch behind my mind even if I replace smoking with drinking water
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,329,"It's understandable to feel concerned about that persistent itch in the back of your mind, even if you try replacing smoking with something else. This craving can seem daunting, but it's worth exploring some techniques that address those deeper urges. It's not just about substitution; it's about retraining your mind slowly and steadily.

What do you think might help you manage this fear about cravings, or are there particular times when they get stronger?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,330,they get stronger when i try to stop
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,331,"It sounds like the cravings really intensify when you make an effort to quit, which makes the process even more challenging for you. Recognizing when these feelings are at their strongest is an important step. Managing these moments could involve small, gradual changes that give your mind time to adapt.

We could think about ways to gently reduce dependence rather than stopping abruptly, or perhaps introduce new activities that are genuinely engaging. How do you feel about trying small changes that progress toward reducing smoking gradually?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,332,go ahead
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,333,"Great! Let's consider a gradual approach that might feel more manageable:

1. **Setting Small Goals**: Start by reducing by one cigarette a day or delaying the first cigarette in the morning by a bit longer each day.

2. **Creating a New Routine**: Use that craving moment as a cue to do something enjoyable—listen to a favorite song, take deep breaths, or even write down what you're grateful for.

3. **Mindful Reflection**: When a craving hits, pause for a moment to notice what you're feeling physically and emotionally. Sometimes, acknowledging the sensation can make it feel less powerful.

4. **Focus on Progress**: Recognize and reward yourself for meeting smaller milestones, like reducing the number of cigarettes in a week.

Would trying any of these strategies suit you, or do you have other thoughts on what might work better for you?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,334,sounds better
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,335,"That's encouraging to hear! Starting with smaller steps can make the journey feel less overwhelming. It's all about making progress that feels right for you. As you try these strategies, keep in mind the important reason you're doing this, like being there for your kids.

As we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind or anything you’d like to explore further?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,336,can i vape instead
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,337,"Switching to vaping is a common consideration among those looking to quit smoking. It might reduce exposure to some harmful elements, but it’s important to approach it carefully, as vaping also carries its own risks and potential dependency.

Would you like to weigh the pros and cons of vaping together, or discuss other alternatives that might work for you?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,338,ok
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,339,"Thinking about vaping involves weighing what might be gained against what remains challenging:

**Pros**:
- **Fewer Chemicals**: Vaping generally involves fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes.
- **Step-down Approach**: Some find it easier to gradually reduce nicotine levels when vaping.
- **Less Odor**: Unlike smoking, vapor typically doesn’t linger with as strong a smell.

**Cons**:
- **Health Risks**: Vaping can still pose health risks, particularly if continued long-term.
- **Still Addictive**: It contains nicotine, which can maintain addiction.
- **Unknown Long-term Effects**: The long-lasting effects of vaping are not fully clear.

It's really about finding what's best for your lifestyle and goals. How do these considerations align with what you're aiming for in terms of your health and lifestyle changes?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,340,maybe i can switch to vape then start reducing?
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,341,"Switching to vaping with the intent to gradually reduce nicotine intake could serve as a transitional tool. It sounds like a plan that feels manageable for you and aligns with your desire to gradually ease off smoking. 

As you think about this approach, remember to regularly check in with yourself on how you feel and if it’s moving you toward your ultimate goal. Staying mindful of your progress and the impact on your health can guide your journey.

Are there any particular questions or concerns you have about going forward with this plan?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,342,no
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,counsellor,343,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let’s recap what we’ve talked about. You're motivated to quit smoking for your health and your kids, understanding the impact smoking could have on your presence in their lives. You currently smoke five times a day and are facing the challenge of cravings, particularly when you try to stop. We've explored small steps, such as reducing smoking gradually and developing a new routine, while also weighing the possibility of transitioning to vaping as a step-down approach. You're focused on creating meaningful changes, aiming for a healthier lifestyle, and the pride of your kids. If there's anything further you'd like to expand on next time, feel free to bring it up. You've made significant reflections today, and I look forward to hearing more about your progress.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
10,67203fd3fe9e55e9ec82fc1f,client,344,No
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,345,Hello! It's great to meet you. How are you doing today?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,346,good
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,347,I'm glad to hear that. How has your week been so far? Anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about today?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,348,not really
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,349,"That's perfectly fine. We can take things at your pace. If anything comes to mind, feel free to share. Since we're here, maybe we could talk a bit about your smoking habit. How do you feel about it these days?"
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,350,i think it will be hard for me to stop
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,351,It sounds like you're feeling that quitting might be a challenging journey. Sometimes it can feel tough to even think about changes like that. What are some of the things that make smoking feel hard to give up for you?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,352,the withdrawal of nicotine and how the changes will affect me
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,353,It seems like you're concerned about how the withdrawal might impact you and how things might change once you stop smoking. That can definitely weigh heavily on anyone's mind. Is there a particular aspect of those changes or challenges that stands out to you most?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,354,shakes
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,355,"The prospect of dealing with shakes, or any physical symptoms, can be really unsettling. It's understandable to have concerns about how your body might react. Along with these worries, have there been any moments when you found yourself thinking about the benefits of quitting?"
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,356,yes it will save me money and it is better for my health
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,357,The idea of saving money and knowing it's healthier for you are strong reasons to consider quitting. It seems like you're weighing the challenges against some positive outcomes. How do these benefits make you feel when you think about them?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,358,they would make me feel more positive about myself
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,359,Imagining those benefits seems to bring a sense of positivity and self-affirmation. Having that potential for positive change can be motivating. What would feeling more positive about yourself mean for you in your day-to-day life?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,360,i think it would make me feel healthier
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,361,"Feeling healthier could really have a great impact on your everyday life. It seems like it's not just about quitting smoking, but also about embracing a healthier lifestyle overall. Are there specific activities or aspects of life where you'd like to feel that boost in health?"
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,362,i get breathlessness a lot which is down to smoking
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,363,"Dealing with breathlessness can be tough, especially when you know it might be linked to smoking. Wanting to breathe easier and participate in activities without that struggle seems very important to you. How does this breathlessness affect your daily routine or the things you love to do?"
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,364,i can't exercise for as long as id like to
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,365,"Feeling limited in your ability to exercise and enjoy it to the fullest can be really frustrating. Exercise might be an important part of your lifestyle or something you miss doing as much as you'd like. When you think about being able to exercise more freely, how does that vision look to you?"
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,366,the feeling i feel gives me inspiration but i don't think i will be able to do it
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,367,"The idea of exercising more freely and the inspiration it brings seems to spark something positive for you, yet it feels overshadowed by doubts about whether it's achievable. It's as though there's a part of you that's inspired and another that's unsure. What do you think makes that feeling of doubt stronger right now?"
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,368,because i am focusing on the positive side of not smoking and how long ive smoked and think im not going to be able to acheive it
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,369,It sounds like the contrast between your hopes for the positive outcomes and the reality of how long you've smoked is creating a sense of doubt. It's like wanting to embrace those positive changes while also feeling weighed down by the past. What do you think might help you bridge that gap between where you are now and where you want to be?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,370,by giving it a try and to stop doubting myself about it
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,371,Taking the step to give it a try and working on reducing self-doubt seems like it could be empowering for you. Giving yourself the opportunity to explore what's possible might open up new paths. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about before we consider how you might take that first step?
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,372,no
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,counsellor,373,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's go over what we've talked about. We've explored your feelings about quitting smoking, especially the challenge of dealing with nicotine withdrawal and the thought of shaking. You've also mentioned looking forward to the benefits of quitting, like feeling healthier and saving money, and enhancing your exercise routine without the breathlessness. It seems there's a strong pull between the doubts stemming from how long you've been smoking and the inspiration you feel from envisioning a healthier lifestyle. You've talked about wanting to give it a try and work on reducing self-doubt, which can be such a powerful step forward. Thank you again for this conversation, and whenever you're ready, we can continue exploring these important topics.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
11,59cb95053306be000195be2e,client,374,No
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,375,Hello! I'm really glad to have you here today. How are you feeling as we get started with our session together?
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,376,I am good
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,377,That's great to hear! I appreciate you taking the time to be here. How have things been going for you lately?
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,378,Not bad everything is okay
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,379,"I'm glad to hear things are okay for you. Sometimes, life can get a bit hectic, so it's nice when things feel settled. Could you tell me a little about what brought you here today?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,380,Trying to stop smoking
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,381,"That's a really significant decision, and it's great that you're thinking about it. Stopping smoking can be a challenging journey, but taking the first step by coming here shows a lot of strength. Can you tell me more about what led you to consider stopping smoking?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,382,I think its not good for my health
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,383,"You've identified a really important reason to think about quitting. Recognizing that smoking might not be good for your health is a clear and honest acknowledgment. What changes have you noticed, or what concerns do you have about how smoking affects your health?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,384,I do not want to spoil my lungs
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,385,"That's a very valid concern, wanting to protect your lungs and keep them healthy. Taking care of your lungs is a vital part of overall well-being. When you think about making this change, what thoughts and feelings come into play that might hold you back or make you hesitant?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,386,You tell me what health issues can i get from smoking
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,387,"I understand you're curious about the health implications of smoking. If it's alright with you, I can share some general information about that. Many people worry about their lung health, as smoking is often linked to conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It's also associated with a higher risk of lung cancer and can affect overall cardiovascular health. But before we go into more detail, would you like to hear anything specific about the effects of smoking on health?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,388,Yes
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,389,"Smoking can indeed impact many aspects of your health. It can reduce lung function over time and increase the risk of respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Smoking is also a major cause of heart disease and can affect your circulation, leading to problems like high blood pressure. Beyond that, smoking can affect your immune system, making you more susceptible to illnesses.

It's understandable to have concerns given these potential risks. What thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about these health impacts?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,390,Yes
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,391,"Thinking about these potential health impacts can sometimes bring up a mix of feelings. It might feel overwhelming, or perhaps motivating to consider making a change. What are some thoughts or emotions you're experiencing now as we talk about this?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,392,Yes about the lungs
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,393,"Understanding the impact on your lungs seems important to you, and it makes sense given how central they are to your overall health. It sounds like you're concerned about how smoking might affect your lung health in particular. How does that concern influence your thoughts about possibly quitting smoking?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,394,Yeah I become scared because i smoke every single day
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,395,"Feeling scared is a completely natural response when thinking about something that might affect your health, especially when it's something you engage in daily. Your concern shows you care deeply about your well-being. How do you see yourself managing this fear while considering your goals for the future?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,396,Yes I look at the bright future and take my mind off that fear.
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,397,"Focusing on a brighter future is a powerful way to shift your mindset and address that fear. Visualizing positive outcomes can often be motivating and give you a sense of direction. I'm curious, what does that bright future look like for you when you imagine it without smoking?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,398,Me having money with a beautiful family of my own .
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,399,"That's a wonderful vision—a life filled with financial stability and the joy of having a beautiful family. Those are truly meaningful goals. How do you see quitting smoking fitting into that picture, or how do you imagine it contributing to that future you envision?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,400,I think i will be able to achieve that dream if i do not complicate my health
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,401,"It sounds like quitting smoking might play an important role in achieving your dreams by supporting your health and well-being. By making a choice that aligns with your vision, you're opening up possibilities for that future you described. Is there anything else you want to explore or discuss about your reasons for considering a change?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,402,No this is enough
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,counsellor,403,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let me summarize what we've discussed. You've been thinking about quitting smoking, mainly because you're concerned about your lung health and don't want to spoil them. You acknowledged that smoking daily can be scary for your health, and you're aware of the associated risks like lung and heart issues. A bright future is motivating for you—one where you see yourself with financial stability and a beautiful family, all supported by maintaining your health. Quitting smoking is part of that vision for a healthier, happier life. If there's ever more you'd like to explore or other questions you have, I'm here to help.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
12,66a3cd1037c430dcfd67efc7,client,404,No
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,405,Hello! I'm glad you decided to join this session. How are you feeling today? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about at the beginning?
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,406,I'm fine thank you
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,407,"That's great to hear. I'm here to support you, so feel free to share anything that's on your mind. Shall we start by talking about what led you to this session today?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,408,the study was open
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,409,"I appreciate your openness in coming to this session. While we have this time together, is there anything specific you'd like to explore or discuss, perhaps related to smoking or anything else meaningful to you right now?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,410,"not really, what would you like to talk about?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,411,"This space is really about you, so I'd like to focus on what's important to you. If you're comfortable with it, maybe we can explore your thoughts about smoking. I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. What comes to mind when you think about your smoking habit?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,412,Mainly the financial cost. But i try to smoke as little as i can
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,413,"The financial aspect seems to weigh heavily on you, and it sounds like you're making an effort to cut back on smoking. It’s interesting that you’re already trying to limit how much you smoke. What is it like for you when you think about the cost of smoking?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,414,It is exasperating
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,415,"That sounds really frustrating. Feeling exasperated by the financial burden must be tough to manage. It seems like the cost is a real concern for you. How does it feel when you think about the possibility of making changes to your smoking habits, considering the financial impact?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,416,it feels like it will be very difficult. I have a very stressful life
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,417,"Life is indeed stressful, and considering making changes can feel daunting, especially when you're already managing so much. It's understandable that you're facing this challenge. Despite the stress, I notice you're still thinking about the possibility of change. What do you think makes it feel difficult given your current circumstances?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,418,I do not feel i can change my life right now enough to accommodate a smoke free life
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,419,"It seems like you're feeling quite overwhelmed and unsure about fitting a smoke-free life into your current situation. Managing everything on your plate might make the idea of quitting feel almost impossible at this moment. Yet, you're open enough to talk about it, which shows a lot of courage. What support do you think might help you if you were to consider making even a small change later on?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,420,I think possibly less nagging from others will allow me to consider it more
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,421,It sounds like the pressure from others might be making it harder for you to think about change in your own time. Having the space to consider your options without added stress could make a big difference. How would it feel for you to have more room to decide when and how you approach possible changes to your smoking on your own terms?
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,422,it would feel as if i was making my own decision rather than doing yet another thing for everyone else
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,423,"That sense of having control over the decision seems really important to you. It must be quite empowering to think about making changes because you want to, rather than feeling pushed by others. When you imagine having that space and control, what comes to mind regarding your smoking and the choices you might have in the future?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,424,A future where i have enough time to make choices for myself
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,425,Thinking about a future where you have the time and freedom to make your own choices sounds very significant to you. It offers a sense of autonomy and personal empowerment. How does envisioning such a future affect the way you see your current situation with smoking?
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,426,it helps me to smoke less sometimes
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,427,"That's a meaningful insight. Visualizing a future where you have control seems to empower you to smoke less at times, even amidst the challenges you're facing. It shows your ability to take steps in a direction that feels right for you. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss right now or explore further?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,428,no but i have enjoyed this session
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,counsellor,429,"Thank you for opening up and having this conversation with me today. Let's go over what we've talked about. We touched on how the financial cost of smoking is a major concern for you, how you're making an effort to smoke less despite feeling overwhelmed by stress, and the desire to make decisions for yourself rather than feeling pressured by others. Thinking about a future where you have more control seems to already help you make some changes, like smoking less at times. It's been great to hear your thoughts and I really appreciate your willingness to share. If you ever want to explore these ideas more, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
13,6720c26681a4d34fea38c6ef,client,430,No
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,431,Hello! It's great to have you here today. How have you been doing lately? Anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about? Feel free to share whatever you're comfortable with.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,432,Ive been doing alright. Been dealing with anxiety lately but nothing out of the ordinary for me.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,433,Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like anxiety is something you're familiar with. How have you been managing to cope with it?
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,434,Practically my whole life. Im 38 and have been dealing with it since I was a kid.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,435,That's a long time to be dealing with such a challenging experience. It takes strength to manage anxiety over so many years. Have you found any particular ways or routines that help you handle it?
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,436,I did go the self medication route through drinking for years but that was only a bandaid and made the problems worse in the lonog run instead of dealing with the root cause.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,437,"You've gained some important insight from your experiences with self-medication and its limitations. It can be tough to face the root causes of anxiety, but recognizing what doesn't work can be a significant step forward. What has your relationship with smoking been like, and has it played any role in how you manage anxiety?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,438,It neither helps or hurts my anxiety. Its just a deeply ingrained habit that Ive been doing for 20 years and knowing how tough it is to quit keeps me from trying.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,439,"It sounds like smoking has become a long-standing habit for you, and the idea of quitting feels daunting. That’s completely understandable, especially with how embedded it can become over time. You’ve faced challenges before, so what do you think has kept you going with smoking, despite the negatives?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,440,I think its because the lack of negatives I have from it at the moment. I know how dangerous cigarettes are but they haven't affected me yet so I magically think they aren't harming me.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,441,"You're acknowledging the potential risks of smoking, even though you haven't experienced noticeable negative effects yet. It's human nature to hope for the best when the impact isn't immediately apparent. Given this awareness, have you ever thought about what life might be like without smoking, or what benefits might come from making a change?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,442,"Yes, smelling better, saving money, lower chances of cancer. I'm aware but its tough to quit. Knowing how hard alcohol was for me to quit makes me think my anxiety will get worse when I quit cigarette"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,443,"Those are some valuable benefits you’ve identified, like smelling fresher, saving money, and reducing cancer risk. Overcoming one challenging habit can make facing another feel even more daunting, especially when anxiety is a concern. It’s clear you have a good understanding of yourself and what’s important to you. How has successfully quitting alcohol informed your approach or thoughts about potentially quitting smoking?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,444,I lets me know that I can quit anything If I really really want to. It shows that I have the willpower to
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,445,"It sounds like your experience with quitting alcohol has shown you the strength and willpower you possess. That's a resource you carry with you, even if the journey with smoking presents its own unique challenges. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about at this point concerning your smoking habit or anything else on your mind?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,446,"Is the book ""the easy way to quit smoking"" worth reading? The book easy way to quit drinking helped me quit drinking."
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,447,"You've already benefited from a book that helped with drinking, and it's understandable that you'd consider using a similar approach for smoking. It sounds promising that you’re thinking about resources that have helped you in the past. Would you like to explore together how that book aligns with what you're looking for in terms of support and motivation for quitting smoking?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,448,sure
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,449,"Great! Reflecting on your success with the drinking book, what aspects of it made a difference for you, and how do you envision the smoking book supporting you in a similar way?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,450,"Do you know anything about the book ""The easy way to stop smoking"" by Allen Carr?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,451,"I know that ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" by Allen Carr is a popular resource for many people. The book encourages readers to shift their mindset around smoking, often aiming to remove the psychological dependency. It seems you've approached quitting drinking with an open mind, and Carr’s approach might support you in finding clarity about smoking. Would you be interested in discussing how you might incorporate insights from this book into your journey to address the reasons behind your smoking habit?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,452,Sure
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,453,"Wonderful! As you reflect on why Carr's approach resonated with you before, what particular insights or techniques do you think could be useful in understanding and addressing your smoking habit?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,454,Learning about the psychology behind why we smoke and why our minds rationalize smoking when we know its dangerous.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,455,Gaining a deeper understanding of the psychological aspects behind smoking and the mind's rationalizations can be quite empowering. Exploring these insights might help uncover what's driving the habit and make it easier to challenge those ingrained beliefs. It sounds like you're open to understanding the 'why' behind smoking. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss on this topic?
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,456,Nothing else I can think of.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,457,"You've shared a lot today, and it's clear you're contemplating big, positive changes. To summarize, we've talked about your experiences with anxiety, your long-standing relationship with smoking, the challenges of quitting, and the insights and techniques that might support your journey. The possibility of using resources like ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" to gain clarity and understanding is a step forward.

Would it be alright if we talked more about how you might want to approach this journey and what you might find helpful in the days or weeks ahead?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,458,Ill pick up the audiobook and give it a listen and absorb the information from it and go from there.
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,counsellor,459,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. Let's go over what we've discussed. You've been managing anxiety for a long time, and while smoking hasn't seemed to affect your anxiety directly, it's a well-entrenched habit. We talked about how the potential negatives of smoking might not seem immediate, which can make quitting feel less urgent. You recognized the benefits of quitting, like improved health and finances, and drew strength from successfully quitting alcohol in the past. You mentioned interest in ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" by Allen Carr, as its counterpart helped you quit drinking, and we explored how understanding the psychology behind smoking might aid your journey. I'm glad you plan to give the audiobook a listen and gain insights from it. Whenever you feel ready to discuss more or need support, I'm here. Take things at your own pace, and remember your resilience and strength.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
14,5f7d026c6fd2421d2dc1af04,client,460,No
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,461,Hi there! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been doing lately? Anything you'd like to share or talk about as we start our session?
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,462,Im doing great I want to stop smoking but at the same time the fixation is great
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,463,It sounds like you're feeling two different things at once—wanting to quit smoking but also enjoying the sensation it provides. That can be challenging. What makes quitting important to you right now?
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,464,I guess just the health affects when I'm older
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,465,You're thinking ahead to the future and considering how smoking might impact your health as you get older. It's commendable you're placing value on your long-term well-being. Are there any particular health concerns that you find yourself thinking about?
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,466,The way it makes me destress is great
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,467,So smoking gives you a way to manage stress and find some relaxation. It's understandable why that could feel tough to give up. What are some situations or moments when you find yourself reaching for a cigarette to destress?
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,468,Just whenever i feel like it i guess no one moment makes me like stress really lol I just enjoy smoking
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,469,"You enjoy the act of smoking itself, without needing a specific trigger or stressor. Smoking has become an enjoyable routine for you, managing stress just happens to be a part of it. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in your everyday life?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,470,It doesnt really play a huge role like i can go without also like I don't have nay today and it kinda sucks cause I'm hungover from drinking last night but it's okay
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,471,"It sounds like smoking isn't something you're heavily dependent on, but it's still something you miss, especially when you're not feeling too well. Going without it today might be a bit inconvenient, but you're getting through it. How does it feel to know you can handle situations without smoking, like today?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,472,it feels great actually cause like you said I'm not heavily dependent on it
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,473,"That's a positive realization, recognizing that you're not heavily dependent on smoking and can manage without it. You have more control over your smoking than you might have thought. What other things have you noticed about your relationship with smoking? Are there other aspects of quitting that you're considering?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,474,My grandmother has smoke all my life so I've seen the effects it has on her and have wanted to stop
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,475,"You've observed the effects of smoking on your grandmother, and that's given you additional reasons to consider quitting. Her experience has had a significant influence on how you view smoking and your own future. How does seeing those effects on someone you care about shape your thoughts about quitting?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,476,lol i just dont want to wrinkle quickly or have a smokers cough
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,477,"You're thinking about the physical changes and health implications, like wrinkles and a chronic cough, that can come with smoking. Those are valid concerns, and wanting to avoid them is understandable. Considering these factors, how do you see yourself moving forward with your relationship with smoking?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,478,probably will smoke off and on like models do idk
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,479,"You imagine a more casual relationship with smoking, perhaps only partaking occasionally. You're considering a way to balance the enjoyable aspects of smoking with minimizing its downsides. What would it mean for you to shift to smoking less frequently, like you mentioned?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,480,idk just seems like itll be better to just do like socially or when I'm drinking then everyday all day type thing
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,481,"You see the potential benefits in cutting down and making it more of a social activity or something that accompanies certain situations, rather than an everyday habit. This change could help you manage the aspects of smoking you're concerned about while still enjoying it in specific contexts. Is there anything else you want to explore or share about this shift?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,482,no
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,counsellor,483,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to go over what we've discussed. You mentioned wanting to quit smoking for health reasons in the long run, like avoiding wrinkles and a smoker's cough, especially having seen the effects on your grandmother. While you enjoy smoking for relaxation and as part of a routine, you've realized you're not heavily dependent on it, as you've managed without cigarettes today. You're considering a shift to smoking more casually, only during social occasions or when drinking, rather than as an everyday habit. This conversation seems to have helped you explore and recognize your thoughts around smoking and prompted you to think of how you'd like to alter your relationship with it. If you ever want to continue discussing this or anything else, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
15,6716eef36b9a92ebc4ddcdb1,client,484,No
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,485,Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How are you doing?
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,486,I'm doing ok. A little tired
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,487,"It sounds like you're having one of those days where you're feeling a bit worn out. It's perfectly fine, and I'm glad you made it here nonetheless. What's been going on lately that's taken some of your energy?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,488,Have a cold that I'm still recovering from
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,489,I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with a cold. That can really drain your energy. How are you managing with it? Anything in particular that's been helpful or challenging during this time?
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,490,Just drinking lots of water and resting
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,491,"Taking it easy and staying hydrated sounds like a good approach. It can be challenging to balance rest and recovery, especially with everything else life throws at us. Is there anything else on your mind that's been occupying your thoughts lately?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,492,No
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,493,"That's perfectly fine. Sometimes keeping things simple is best. If you're comfortable, I'd like to learn more about what brings you here, particularly around smoking. How are you feeling about your relationship with smoking right now?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,494,I kind of hate it and know I need to stop for my overall health
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,495,"It sounds like you're aware of how smoking is impacting your health, and you have a desire to move away from it. This must be a significant realization for you. What's motivating you to consider making this change?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,496,Getting older and trying to manage my overall health better. It starts with quitting smoking
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,497,"You've recognized that taking care of your health is becoming more important to you as you get older, and quitting smoking seems like the starting point. It takes a lot of insight to connect those dots. What do you imagine your life might look like if you were able to leave smoking behind?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,498,More energy and better cardio
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,499,Imagining more energy and improved cardio sounds like it could be a refreshing change. Those benefits are certainly appealing. This vision of a healthier life seems important to you. What's been holding you back from making this change so far?
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,500,Daily stress of life has made me keep on smoking probably
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,501,"Dealing with daily stress can be overwhelming, and it sounds like smoking has become a way to cope with it. It can be tough finding new ways to manage stress without the habits we're used to. What have you thought about trying to handle stress in a different way, or is that something you're still exploring?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,502,I'm starting to meditate every morning and before bed to help cope with my stress and anxiety
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,503,That's a positive step! Meditation can be a powerful tool for managing stress and anxiety. It seems like you're already taking steps toward taking care of yourself in new ways. How has meditation been working for you so far?
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,504,"I've been pretty consistent. Unfortunately, only doing 5 minutes at a time. Would like to do 10 minutes each time ideally"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,505,"Consistency is an achievement in itself, and starting with 5 minutes is a solid foundation. You're already setting goals for yourself, like aiming for 10 minutes, which shows commitment to your well-being. What do you think might help you gradually build up to those 10 minutes?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,506,I'm not sure actualy
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,507,"That's completely understandable. Building and extending new routines can sometimes feel uncertain. Since you're open to exploring this further, it might be helpful to think about small adjustments or support that can encourage you. If you ever feel comfortable discussing this further, I'm here to support you in finding those incremental steps. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about concerning smoking or other aspects of your health?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,508,I can't think of anything at this moment
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,counsellor,509,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let me summarize what we've talked about. You've been managing a cold, which has left you feeling a bit tired, yet you're making efforts like drinking water and resting. You've expressed some ambivalence around smoking, recognizing its impact on your health, and you've been motivated by the idea of having more energy and better cardio. Despite daily stress being a challenge, you've taken a proactive step by incorporating meditation to manage stress and anxiety, and you're focusing on building up from 5 to 10 minutes. It's clear that you're giving thoughtful consideration to your health and well-being. If you ever feel ready to explore further steps or need support, I'm here for you whenever you decide. Stay well, and I hope to connect with you again soon!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
16,5c3eadd8ef1d0d0001b2a940,client,510,No
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,511,Hi there! It's great to meet with you today. How are you doing? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,512,Why is it so difficult to quit smoking cigarettes
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,513,"It sounds like there’s a real struggle there, and I can understand how challenging it must feel. Cigarettes have a way of hooking into both your body and routine, making it hard to let go. What do you think makes quitting particularly difficult for you?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,514,"Social aspects, alone time, comfort."
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,515,"Smoking seems to have become a part of your social interactions and personal moments, perhaps offering you some comfort along the way. These are meaningful aspects to consider. How does smoking fit into those situations for you, and how do they make you feel?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,516,"Good, it usually always makes me feel good. Can you tell me health benefits of non-smoking please"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,517,"I'd be happy to share some information about the health benefits of not smoking. Reducing or quitting smoking can improve your lung function, increase your energy levels, and lower your risk of smoking-related diseases like heart disease and cancer. People often notice clearer skin and better circulation too. 

Would it be okay if I shared more about this, or is there something specific you'd like to explore?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,518,Share more
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,519,"Certainly! In addition to the physical benefits, many people find that quitting smoking can improve their sense of taste and smell, leading to more enjoyment of food and life in general. Breathing becomes easier, which can enhance physical activities and exercise. Overall, your body starts to heal itself, and you may feel an increased sense of control and accomplishment.

I'm curious about what matters most to you when thinking about your health and well-being. How do these benefits resonate with you?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,520,"I'd like to live longer, be healthier and live a meaningful life"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,521,"Living a longer and healthier life sounds like it's really important to you, and you want to feel that your life is meaningful. Those are powerful motivations. How do smoking and not smoking fit into your vision of that meaningful life?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,522,"I like to smoke, and it doesn't bother me to smoke. I am concerned about money and health effects in the long run"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,523,"You find smoking enjoyable and haven’t felt bothered by it, but concerns about money and long-term health effects are weighing on you. It sounds like there’s a balance you're trying to find between what you enjoy and what will support your future goals. How do you see those concerns influencing your thoughts or feelings about smoking?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,524,"I need to quit smoking and I want to, but I'd miss out on personal relationships and personal time with friends and loved ones."
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,525,"On one hand, there's a strong desire and recognition of the need to quit, driven by your health and financial concerns. On the other, there's a worry about losing those special connections and moments that smoking seems to facilitate. Balancing these important parts of your life must feel quite challenging. 

What kind of support or changes might help you maintain those relationships and personal moments while working toward quitting smoking?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,526,I could still go outside with smokers even though I don't partake
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,527,"That's a thoughtful approach. Staying connected to your friends and loved ones without necessarily smoking could help maintain those relationships. It shows adaptability and a willingness to work toward your goals.

How do you feel about this potential change? And is there anything else on your mind around this decision to quit that you'd like to explore?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,528,Nothing else on my mind. I feel ok about it
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,counsellor,529,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's go over what we've talked about. You expressed a desire to quit smoking due to concerns about money and long-term health effects. At the same time, smoking seems to be tied to important social interactions and moments of comfort for you, making the decision to quit challenging. However, you're open to maintaining those relationships by still spending time with your friends, just without smoking. You're aiming for a healthier, more meaningful life, and we've discussed how quitting aligns with those goals. Thank you for this open conversation, and I'm here to support you as you consider your next steps.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
17,5cfd68599d3b5700198ab635,client,530,No
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,531,Hello there! It's really nice to meet you today. How are you feeling as we start our conversation?
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,532,i am good
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,533,I'm glad to hear that. I’m here to listen and chat about anything you'd like to discuss today. Is there something specific on your mind or a particular reason you wanted to talk?
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,534,my smoking
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,535,Thank you for sharing that with me. Smoking is something that many people have mixed feelings about. What's your experience been like with smoking recently?
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,536,its getting harder and harder to function normally while smoking
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,537,It sounds like smoking is taking a toll on how you feel day-to-day. Can you share more about how it's affecting your ability to function?
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,538,harder to breathe
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,539,Breathing is such an important part of feeling well and staying active. It sounds really difficult to face that kind of challenge. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in making it harder for you to breathe?
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,540,im not sure
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,541,"It's okay to feel uncertain, especially when dealing with something that's complicated like smoking. Part of you might recognize the impact it's having, while another part might find it hard to consider what that means. What are some reasons you've chosen to keep smoking, even with the difficulties you're experiencing?"
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,542,its a mental thing i think
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,543,Smoking can definitely have a strong mental and emotional component. It might feel like it fulfills certain needs or helps in certain situations. Can you tell me more about what smoking provides for you mentally or emotionally?
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,544,it calms my nerves and make me less anxious
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,545,Finding ways to manage anxiety and calm your nerves is really important. It sounds like smoking has been a go-to solution for you in those moments. What are your thoughts on how smoking and anxiety are connected for you?
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,546,im not sure
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,547,"That's perfectly okay. Untangling those connections isn't always straightforward. You're exploring how smoking helps with anxiety, but you're also noticing its impact on your breathing and daily functioning. What’s important is to honor your process as you consider both the benefits and the challenges of smoking. Is there anything else about your experience with smoking that you're curious to explore?"
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,548,is vaping healthier than smoking
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,549,"That's a great question. Many people wonder about the differences between smoking and vaping. Vaping is often considered less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes because it involves fewer of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, it’s still not without risks. Would you like more information on that, or is there anything else you'd like to explore about your situation today?"
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,550,no thank you
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,counsellor,551,"Thank you for the conversation we've had today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed so far. You've shared that smoking has made it harder for you to function normally, particularly affecting your ability to breathe. On the other hand, smoking seems to calm your nerves and helps with anxiety. Your interest in understanding whether vaping might be a healthier alternative was also discussed. Through exploring these aspects, you've expressed both the challenges and the role smoking plays in your life right now. If there's anything else you'd like to talk about in the future, I'm here to support you whenever you feel ready.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
18,672ff35fc68be1c3a2a49e58,client,552,No
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,553,"Hello, it's great to see you here today. How are you feeling as we start our conversation?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,554,Hello. I am feeling great. What about you/
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,555,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I'm really glad to hear that you're feeling great. What brings you here today?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,556,I'm just participating in a research study
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,557,"That's interesting, and I'm glad you're here. I understand this study might be exploring different aspects of smoking. Would you like to share your experiences with smoking, or what your thoughts are about it at the moment?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,558,"I enjoy smoking a lot, with coffee in the morning especially."
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,559,"It sounds like smoking has become a part of your daily routine, especially when paired with something you enjoy, like coffee. Have there been any moments when you've thought about what smoking means to you or any feelings about wanting to explore changes related to it?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,560,"Yes, it's just a part of my daily routine and is something I like to do"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,561,"It means a lot to you as part of your day and brings some enjoyment. At the same time, it's completely normal to have moments of reflecting on habits, even the ones we like. Have you ever had thoughts or feelings about anything you might want to be different about your smoking habit?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,562,No
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,563,Thank you for being honest about that. It sounds like you're comfortable with your current smoking routine. It's important to talk about what feels right for you at this point. Is there anything else about your smoking or wellness that you'd be interested in exploring or talking about today?
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,564,"I am actually planning to quit smoking in few years from now. It won't be difficult, I can quit if I want, just want to enjoy it a little longer."
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,565,"You have a plan in mind for the future, confident in your ability to quit when the time feels right for you. Enjoying smoking for now and considering quitting later suggests you've thought about balancing your enjoyment with future goals. Is there anything about why you might want to quit in the future that you'd like to discuss or reflect on?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,566,"I can do anything if I am programming my mind to do it right. Everything is possible, you just need to want the change in the first place and then believe in yourself. Take action. I am not a kid, if"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,567,"You seem to have a strong sense of self-belief and determination, knowing that when you're ready, you'll be able to make a change with confidence. It sounds like you have a good understanding of what it takes to pursue goals and that belief in yourself is key. When it comes to making changes in the future, it's that inner confidence and mindset that can be really powerful. Would you say this mindset has helped you in other areas of your life as well?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,568,Yes deffinetely this mindset has helped me in many areas.
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,569,"It's wonderful to hear you're drawing on that mindset and strength across different areas of your life. This sense of empowerment seems to be a great resource for you. If you'd like, we can explore how this approach might support you when it comes to your smoking goals in the future, or we can discuss any other topics you're interested in today."
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,570,Go on
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,571,"Great, let's take a closer look at how this mindset could play a role in your journey with smoking. You've already mentioned your confidence and ability to program your mind for change. Can you think of any strategies or past experiences where you've successfully applied this mindset to achieve a goal? That could be a helpful way to envision your approach to quitting smoking when the time comes."
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,572,"I actually quited smoking in the past with this mindset. I had over a year not touching cigarettes. If I did it before, I can do it again"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,573,"You've already proven to yourself that you can quit smoking when you set your mind to it, which is a powerful reminder of your capabilities. Having that experience under your belt must reinforce your confidence even further. Reflecting on that time, are there any specific strategies or motivations that you found particularly helpful or inspiring?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,574,"Honestly, just needed to wake up one day and say to yourself this is the day, I'm doing it now. And if there is determination, you can do it."
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,575,"Your determination and decisive mindset really stand out as key factors in your previous success. It seems like making that firm decision was empowering for you. Knowing this about yourself, you have a clear template for how you might approach quitting smoking again in the future, when the time feels right for you. Is there anything else you'd like to share or any other thoughts you have about preparing for that day?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,576,"Not really. I just want to do it for my health, my future babies. That's all. Thank you"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,counsellor,577,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. Let me summarize what we've discussed. You mentioned smoking brings enjoyment to your daily routine, especially with coffee, and that you're comfortable with it as part of your life. However, you also plan to quit in a few years for your health and future children. You have a strong sense of self-belief, knowing that when you decide to make a change, your mindset and determination are powerful tools. You've successfully quit smoking in the past by making a firm decision and sticking to it, which gives you confidence for the future. If you ever want to explore this further or discuss any other topic, I'm here and happy to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
19,66b223d532199c29ed32c8f4,client,578,No
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,579,Hello there! It's great to meet you. How are you feeling today?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,580,im feeling alright.
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,581,"I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to support you with anything you might want to discuss, especially around the topic of smoking, if that feels relevant to you today. Is there anything particular on your mind that you'd like to talk about?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,582,not that i can think of. perhaps smoking cessation?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,583,That's a great topic to explore. What are your thoughts about your smoking right now?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,584,that i should probably stop
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,585,It sounds like you've been considering quitting smoking. Can you tell me more about what's motivating you to think about making this change?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,586,nothing in particular is really motivating me. its just a thought i had.
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,587,"Having the thought that you ""should probably stop"" can still be important. It shows there's some awareness or consideration around the habit. Is there anything about smoking that you find challenging, or that you wish was different in your life?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,588,i'm not sure what you mean exactly. can you reword that question?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,589,Of course! Are there any parts of your life or health where you think smoking might be having an impact that you'd like to change or improve?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,590,general quality of life i would say. people report being able to taste and smell better once theyve quit smoking. that seems like a pretty large thing
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,591,"Improving your quality of life, like experiencing enhanced taste and smell, sounds like a meaningful benefit you're considering. It's interesting to hear how these aspects resonate with you. Would you say there are other areas of your life where you imagine a potential change in smoking might have an effect?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,592,outside of generalized health improvements there isnt really much i can think of
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,593,"Thinking about general health improvements is certainly a valuable consideration. Sometimes, even the broader, subtle changes can make a significant difference. How do you feel about the idea of potentially experiencing these shifts in your health and well-being?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,594,"good, obviously? its not as if i'd feel bad about experiencing health benefits"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,595,"The idea of experiencing health benefits seems very positive to you. It's natural to look forward to feeling better overall. Since we’re exploring this, is there anything else on your mind that you think might be important to consider when thinking about changing your smoking habits?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,596,"i use an electronic machine to roll cigarettes for my father on a daily basis, so i'm pretty much always around tobacco and have access to quickly make a cigarette whenever i please. this can be hard"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,597,Being around tobacco and having that easy access must indeed make things more challenging when thinking about quitting. It sounds like this is a significant factor in your day-to-day life. How do you feel about this connection between helping your father and your own smoking habits?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,598,I just described that to you..
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,599,It sounds like the constant presence of tobacco and its easy availability in your environment is making it harder for you to quit. Balancing the support for your father with your own goals must be tricky. Do you have any thoughts on how you might navigate this challenge if you decide to pursue a change?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,600,no idea really.
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,601,"It's understandable not to have an answer right now, considering how tied your routine is to the process. If you're interested, we can talk more about these challenges and explore some possibilities together, whenever you're ready. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience or thoughts around smoking?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,602,"no, let us explore the possibilities. i find you ask too many questions."
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,603,"Thank you for letting me know, and I appreciate your patience. Let's shift our focus to exploring some possibilities. From what you've shared, enhancing your quality of life and health could be motivating factors. Perhaps we can look into small, manageable steps or changes that might fit into your daily life. Would you like to brainstorm together on that?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,604,yes..
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,605,"Great! One option might be to identify moments in your day where you feel more inclined to smoke and consider small changes you could make during those times. Another idea is setting specific goals that feel achievable to you, like cutting back gradually. Are there any approaches or small changes that come to mind that might feel feasible to try?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,606,i find it difficult to keep a number on how many cigarettes i am smoking throughout the day
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,607,"That's a valuable insight. Keeping track can be challenging, especially when it's part of your routine. One approach could be to try keeping a simple log or journal, either on paper or using an app, to note down each cigarette as you have it. This can create awareness without adding stress. Does trying something like that sound manageable, or is there another way you might prefer to approach it?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,608,another idea.
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,609,"Absolutely, let's consider another possibility. Sometimes people find it helpful to set specific times of the day to take a break or do an activity they enjoy that doesn't involve smoking. This can create a shift in routine without focusing directly on the number of cigarettes. Would finding new activities or times to enjoy them work as a potential approach for you?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,610,that could maybe work. i have been meaning to learn an instrument but i keep putting it off. it has been gathering dust
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,611,That's a wonderful idea! Learning an instrument could be a fulfilling way to spend time and create a new routine. It might serve as a distraction and be an enjoyable outlet. How do you feel about setting aside some time for this new hobby and seeing how it might fit into your goal regarding smoking?
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,612,i dont feel any particular way about it
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,613,"That's perfectly okay. Trying new things or adjusting routines might take time to feel comfortable. Starting with something neutral, like fitting in even a small amount of practice, could gradually create more connection and enjoyment. If you try it, you can observe how it feels over time. Is there anything else you’d like us to cover, or does this feel like a good point to pause?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,614,nothing that i can think of.
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,615,"Thank you for sharing with me today. I appreciate your openness, and it sounds like we've explored some meaningful areas. If, in the future, there’s more you’d like to discuss or any support you need as you consider these changes, feel free to reach out. Would it be alright if we talked more about planning next time, based on what feels right for you?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,616,go ahead
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,counsellor,617,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about so far. You mentioned that you’ve been thinking about quitting smoking to improve your quality of life and enjoy potential health benefits like enhanced taste and smell. We discussed some of the challenges, like frequent access to tobacco due to helping your father, which makes stopping more difficult. We also explored possible ways to navigate these challenges, like perhaps tracking your smoking or finding new activities. You mentioned a particular interest in learning an instrument, which could become a positive new routine. If you decide to pursue that, it might be a step toward change. Whenever you’re ready to explore more, we can talk about it further. Thank you again for sharing with me today, and I look forward to continuing this conversation whenever you’re ready.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
20,610898813e48dc2864965122,client,618,No
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,619,Hi there! I'm glad we have this time here today. How are you feeling about being here and having this conversation?
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,620,hoping to learn about quitting
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,621,That's great to hear that you're interested in learning about quitting. It sounds like there might be something motivating you to consider this change. Would you like to share what's been on your mind about smoking recently?
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,622,i have slowly been moving to snus and cutting back on cigarettes
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,623,It sounds like you've made some changes recently by moving towards snus and cutting back on cigarettes. What has motivated you to make these steps? How do you feel about these changes so far?
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,624,better health and cost of cigarettes. wish it was easier
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,625,"You're focusing on your health and the financial cost as important reasons for moving away from cigarettes, which shows a lot about your priorities and values. It can be challenging, and you're expressing a desire for it to be easier. What aspects have you found particularly challenging, and have there been any moments when you've felt good about the progress you're making?"
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,626,challenging when out drinking but good to be smoking a lot less
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,627,"It sounds like social situations, especially when drinking, can make it harder to stick to your goals. Yet, you're feeling good about smoking a lot less overall, which is a significant achievement. What have you noticed about those times when it's been difficult? Are there any strategies or thoughts that have helped you manage in those situations?"
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,628,alcohol increases cravings a lot and the snus affects drink taste
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,629,"It sounds like alcohol not only increases your cravings but also alters your experience with snus, affecting how your drink tastes. This adds an extra layer of challenge when you're out with friends. How do you feel about these interactions between alcohol, cravings, and taste, and is there anything you've thought might be worth trying to handle those situations differently?"
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,630,maybe a different cessation thing
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,631,"You're open to exploring different ways to support your journey towards quitting. It's understandable to consider alternatives when something isn't quite working out the way you hoped. Is there anything specific you've heard about or that you're curious to try, that might help you in those challenging moments?"
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,632,maybe a patch
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,633,"Considering a nicotine patch might be a helpful next step for you, especially given your interest in exploring different cessation methods. It can provide a more consistent release of nicotine, which might help manage those cravings without the taste concerns. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to explore or discuss right now?"
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,634,i
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,635,"It seems like there's more you might want to share or explore. Whenever you're ready, feel free to continue. I'm here to support you in any way that might help with your reflections and plans moving forward."
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,636,other methods?
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,637,"You're interested in learning about other methods to help with smoking cessation. There are various options out there, and it could be helpful to find a method that suits you well. Options like nicotine gum, lozenges, inhalers, or even behavioral support and apps are available. Are there any particular types of treatments you've heard of that you'd like more information about, or any preferences you have in terms of trying something new?"
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,client,638,inhalers dont work
21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,639,"It sounds like you've tried inhalers and found they didn't work for you. It's important to find something that feels right for your needs.

21,6103583967377f29277e44ba,counsellor,643,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. Let's go over what we've discussed. You've been making efforts to cut back on smoking by using snus, motivated by your desire for better health and to reduce costs. You've found it challenging, especially in social settings when drinking, and noticed the way snus affects your drink's taste. We've touched on the idea of exploring other cessation methods, like nicotine gum or lozenges, since inhalers weren't effective for you. You're open to trying these different strategies, and it's clear you're committed to finding the right approach for you. If there's ever more you'd like to discuss or explore, I'm here to support you.

The structured environment might allow you to be consistent with your approach. How might you plan to use the gum or lozenges during work breaks or challenging moments at work to support your goal?

22,66af87c11c29ed210481679c,counsellor,689,"Reducing from 5 cigarettes to 3 is a substantial and manageable step.

You’ve expressed a deep gratitude for life and a focus on making choices that align with your health and well-being. Your desire to live a long life for yourself and your kids is certainly a powerful motivator for change. We talked about your recognition of the impact smoking can have on your health and your decision to work on reducing your smoking as a first step. Specifically, you've considered cutting down from 5 cigarettes to 3 a day, and you've focused on reducing your morning cigarette as a starting point.

It's clear that you've thought a lot about this, and your determination really stands out. Feel free to reach out if you need further support or want to discuss more strategies in the future. It's been a pleasure speaking with you, and I wish you the best as you move forward with your goals."
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,692,Hello! It's great to meet you today. I hope you're feeling comfortable as we start our conversation. I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. How have things been going for you recently?
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,693,"Hello, MIBot! I'm glad to chat with you. Things are going well, thanks for asking. It's a good day. How about you? How’s your research project going?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,694,"I'm happy to hear that you're having a good day, and thank you for asking about my work! Things are going well here too. I'm looking forward to our conversation and getting to know a bit about what's important to you. Can you tell me a little about what’s been on your mind or any areas where you're thinking of making some changes?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,695,"It's great to hear things are going well on your end, too! As for me, I've been reflecting a bit on the importance of balance and making sure I'm staying focused on the things that matter most. Lately"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,696,"Balance can be so crucial in daily life, and it's great that you're reflecting on it. There are so many competing demands, and staying focused on important things is a real challenge. Lately, have you noticed anything specific that's been pulling you away from that balance or particular areas you're thinking might need a shift?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,697,"That’s very true — the competing demands can definitely pull us in different directions! I think for me, sometimes it’s easy to get caught up in the details of daily tasks, and that can shift my focus"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,698,"It's completely understandable that daily tasks can sometimes take over and make it difficult to see the bigger picture. It sounds like you have an interest in rediscovering what's truly important to you amidst those everyday demands. When you think about your habits or routines, is there anything in particular that stands out as something you might want to explore or reconsider?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,699,"Exactly — I think there’s something about finding clarity and direction in the middle of everything going on. If I had to single out a habit or routine to explore, I think it would be about how"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,700,"Finding clarity and direction amid all the noise is so valuable. It sounds like there's one particular area you're considering, and exploring that could really open up some insights for you. What are your thoughts about that habit or routine? Are you thinking it might be steering you away from something, or is there something specific you're curious about changing or understanding more deeply?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,701,You're right — finding clarity in the middle of all the noise can make such a big difference. When it comes to the habit I’m thinking about — balancing productivity and rest — I think part of me feels
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,702,"Balancing productivity and rest is a common struggle, and it sounds like it's something you're really interested in understanding more. It seems there's some inner conflict, perhaps between wanting to accomplish a lot and ensuring you have time for rest. Can you share more about what you're feeling on both sides of that balance?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,703,"That’s exactly it — there’s a real pull between wanting to accomplish things and the need for rest, and I can feel that tension internally. On one side, I have this drive to stay busy, to keep moving"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,704,"It's really powerful that you're recognizing that internal drive to stay busy, alongside the need for rest. It seems like there's a part of you that finds fulfillment in being productive, while another part craves that necessary downtime to recharge. How do you feel about the impact this tension might be having on your overall well-being or daily life?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,705,"You’ve put it so well — there’s definitely this duality at play. On one hand, being productive feels rewarding, and on the other, it can leave me drained when I don’t balance it with enough rest."
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,706,"That duality of feeling rewarded by productivity but also experiencing exhaustion without enough rest can really impact your well-being. It sounds like you're noticing how both aspects are significant in your life. How do you think this balance affects other areas, like your energy levels, mood, or even decisions you make daily?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,707,"When I lean too heavily into productivity without enough rest, I notice my energy levels start to dip. I can feel physically drained, like my body is telling me it’s had enough, even if my mind is sti"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,708,"It's insightful that you're noticing how your energy levels and physical well-being signal you when it's time to slow down, even if your mind is pushing forward. This awareness might be a sign that your body is asking for more balance. I wonder how this might relate to other routines or habits in your life. Have you noticed any particular activities or choices that either contribute to or alleviate this tension?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,709,"When I reflect on my routines, I can definitely see certain activities that contribute to this tension. For example, when I’m caught up in work or other responsibilities, I tend to skip out on things"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,710,"It's interesting how certain responsibilities can sometimes take precedence, leading to skipped activities that might otherwise help you find that balance. It sounds like those activities, perhaps ones that offer relaxation or joy, are important to you. How do you think incorporating more of those into your routine might change things for you?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,711,"Incorporating more activities that bring relaxation or joy into my routine could have a pretty transformative effect. Right now, it often feels like my days revolve around getting things done, and any"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,712,"Incorporating these activities could indeed bring a refreshing change, offering a sense of fulfillment and ease beyond just checking off tasks. It sounds like finding space for relaxation and joy could open up opportunities for renewal and satisfaction. Would you like to explore how changes in other areas, like smoking, could align with your goal of balance and well-being?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,713,"It’s a great thought to consider how changes in areas like smoking could also contribute to that overall sense of balance and well-being. I can see how making shifts in habits, especially something li"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,714,"It seems like you're seeing the potential impact that changes in smoking could have on your journey toward a balanced and fulfilling life. Considering this, is there anything about your current smoking habits or your thoughts about smoking that you’re curious to explore or maybe reflect on further?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,715,"Sometimes, smoking feels like a quick break from the day or a way to decompress when I’m feeling overwhelmed. But, when I really think about it, I wonder if there might be other healthier ways I could"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,716,"It's great that you're recognizing smoking as a way you've managed stress or taken breaks, while also contemplating healthier alternatives. This awareness might be an important step in considering other ways to unwind and recharge. Would you like to talk about what some of those healthier alternatives might look like for you, or explore any ideas you have about changing this habit?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,717,One healthier alternative I’ve been considering is just taking a few deep breaths when I feel the urge to smoke. Simple breathing exercises can actually work wonders in reducing stress and helping to
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,718,"Deep breathing can indeed be a powerful tool for stress relief and grounding yourself, offering a moment to pause and regroup. It sounds like you’re already thinking about ways to incorporate this practice to create more balance. Are there other strategies or activities you might also find helpful in supporting your well-being or reducing reliance on smoking?"
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,client,719,It’s great to hear that you think deep breathing could be a helpful tool — I really believe it can offer that quick reset when things feel overwhelming. But I also recognize that changing habits requi
23,671eaf9f657cbb6c44eb7720,counsellor,720,"Thank you for your time and openness in sharing today. We've had a meaningful conversation, reaching that point where we can reflect on everything discussed. 

You mentioned the importance of finding balance amidst daily demands, particularly between productivity and rest. You've noticed how focusing on tasks sometimes drains your energy, leading you to recognize the value of activities that bring relaxation and joy. We touched on how smoking serves as a quick break or stress reliever, and you're considering healthier alternatives like deep breathing—something you believe could offer a quick reset. You also acknowledged that making changes requires more than just one approach.

Looking ahead, it sounds like you're interested in exploring ways to enhance your sense of balance and well-being. I'm here to support you whenever you’re ready. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts and journey with me today."
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,721,"Hello there! I hope you're doing well today. How are you feeling about being here, and is there anything specific you'd like to discuss?"

24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,723,"Thank you for sharing that. Smoking is an important topic, and I'm here to support you in any way I can. Could you tell me a bit more about your experiences with smoking and any thoughts or feelings you've been having around it recently?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,724,I started smoking when I was young and cannot remember a time I did not smoke
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,725,It sounds like smoking has been a part of your life for quite a long time. It can be challenging to think about life without something that's been there for so long. What are some of the thoughts or feelings you have about smoking now?
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,726,I have noticed its affecting my health
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,727,"It's concerning to notice how smoking is impacting your health. You care about your well-being and it's tough to see something having a negative effect. What specific health issues have you noticed, and how do they make you feel about your smoking habits?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,728,Being out of breath
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,729,"Struggling with feeling out of breath must be quite uncomfortable, especially if it's affecting your daily activities. It shows how smoking is taking a toll on your health, and that can be frustrating. What goes through your mind when you experience this, and how does it influence your thoughts about smoking?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,730,It makes me think will I get better if I stopped
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,731,"You're considering the possibility of feeling better if you stopped smoking, and it shows you're evaluating how change might positively impact your well-being. That reflection is really important. How do you feel about the idea of quitting, and what would it mean for your health and daily life if you were to make that change?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,732,I feel nervous
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,733,"Feeling nervous about the idea of quitting is understandable. Change can feel intimidating, especially when it's related to something that's been a part of your life for so long. This apprehension suggests how much this matters to you. What are some of the things that make you feel nervous, and are there aspects of quitting that you find appealing or hopeful?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,734,"I feel I will get angry not smoking, but feeling healthier seems very appealing to me"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,735,Balancing the fear of becoming angry without smoking and the desire to feel healthier presents quite a conflict. It shows you recognize the positive aspects of change and the difficulty of moving away from smoking. What might help you in managing the fear of anger while still keeping the appealing aspects of being healthier in mind?
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,736,Being able to handle the urges
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,737,"Being able to handle the urges seems crucial for you. It seems you desire more control over those moments while maintaining your health as a top priority. What do you think would help you manage those urges, and how can you use your strength and motivation to support yourself through this process?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,738,Not goung straight to the shop and buying ciggerettes when I am anxsious
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,739,Finding ways to prevent yourself from buying cigarettes during anxious moments might make a difference. It indicates your awareness of a pattern and a desire for change. What are some strategies or alternatives you could consider to cope with those anxious feelings?
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,740,That is what I am hoping you are going to give some suggestions
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,741,"I understand you're looking for suggestions, and I appreciate your trust in this process. However, finding what works best for you might involve exploring your own insights and experiences. What has helped you manage anxiety in the past, or are there new activities or practices you're curious about trying to shift your focus away from the urge to buy cigarettes?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,742,what would you suggest to change my patterns
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,743,"Since you're open to exploring this, perhaps we can think together about some ideas. Many people find it helpful to engage in activities they enjoy, like going for a walk, listening to music, or focusing on deep breathing when they feel anxious. Others might reach out to a friend for support or distraction. What do you think resonates with you, or do you have other activities that you might like to incorporate into those moments?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,744,Maybre waiting 5 minutes with breathing when I get the urges
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,745,"That's a thoughtful approach—giving yourself a pause and focusing on breathing for five minutes can create a moment of reflection and calm. It provides a chance to reconsider before acting. How do you feel about trying this, and is there anything else you'd like to incorporate along with this breathing exercise to help support you during those moments?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,746,Maybe focus on a positive result
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,747,"Focusing on a positive result can be a powerful motivator. Imagining the benefits, like improved breathing, increased energy, or any other positive outcomes you envision, could give you a sense of purpose and direction. How do you think visualizing these positive changes will support your efforts, and is there a particular result you're excited about?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,748,Giving me a reward rather than smoking
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,749,"Rewarding yourself in other ways rather than turning to smoking can create a positive reinforcement loop, making the process more gratifying. Identifying small rewards that bring you joy could motivate you to stick with your efforts. What kind of rewards do you find meaningful, and how might they encourage you to continue focusing on your health and well-being?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,750,Maybe better health and the money I save maybe could contribute to a hobby
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,751,"Better health and using the money saved to invest in a hobby you enjoy sounds like a rewarding and fulfilling goal. It highlights how these positive changes can enrich different parts of your life. Is there a particular hobby you're considering, and how might you imagine this change impacting your day-to-day experience?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,752,My motorcycle or traveling
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,753,"Investing in your motorcycle or traveling presents exciting possibilities, filled with experiences and adventures that you care about. These aspirations reflect the larger picture of change and the positives it can bring. How do you feel about aligning your efforts towards quitting smoking with these goals, and what steps do you think could support you in moving closer to these experiences?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,754,good
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,755,"It's encouraging to hear you're feeling positive about connecting your efforts towards healthier habits with your passions and goals. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or discuss as you think about the next steps in your journey, or something more we can address before considering how to put your ideas into action?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,756,nope
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,counsellor,757,"Thank you for opening up and sharing your journey with me today. Let's take a moment to go over what we've talked about. You've shared smoking has been a long-standing part of your life, but noticing its effects on your health, like feeling out of breath, has made you think about the potential benefits of quitting for your well-being. You've mentioned feeling nervous about quitting due to concerns about anger, but you're also drawn to the appeal of feeling healthier. We discussed strategies to handle urges, such as waiting and breathing for five minutes, visualizing positive outcomes, and rewarding yourself in meaningful ways. You've considered how these changes could support your interests, like investing in your motorcycle or traveling, offering exciting motivation. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to help as you explore these possibilities.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
24,62a8e8d53d81e31a0c0331d3,client,758,No
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,759,Hello there! I'm really glad to have this time with you today. How has your week been going so far?
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,760,"Great week, thank you."
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,761,"I'm glad to hear that! It's nice to enjoy a good week. As we get started, is there anything specific that's been on your mind or anything you'd like to talk about today?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,762,I'm very emotional from a movie I just watched.
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,763,"Movies can really touch our hearts and bring up so many emotions, can't they? It's amazing how they can connect with our own experiences. Would you like to share a bit about what moved you, or how you're feeling right now?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,764,Just sort of sad but Ill be ok
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,765,"It's understandable to feel that way after watching something powerful. It's good to acknowledge those emotions, and I'm here if you want to talk more about it. Otherwise, is there anything on your mind regarding smoking or anything else you want to discuss today?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,766,I've been smoking since I was 16
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,767,That's quite a journey you've had with smoking. It can be interesting to reflect on how your relationship with it has evolved over the years. What has it been like for you to have smoking as part of your life for so long?
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,768,Draining really. I'm tired of it.
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,769,"It sounds like smoking has felt quite exhausting for you, and you're experiencing some fatigue with having it in your life for so long. It's not uncommon to feel this way over time. What's been making you feel tired of it lately?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,770,Enough is enough. I can quite for long periods of time. Its the weight gain that kills me.
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,771,"It seems like you're feeling a strong sense of wanting change, but the weight gain is a significant hurdle for you. Balancing those concerns can be really challenging. What has it been like to manage these periods when you’ve quit and then had to deal with the weight gain?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,772,I know what I need to do. Eat right and exercise
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,773,"You clearly have a solid understanding of what could help manage the weight gain. Having that insight is important, but putting it into action can be another story. How have you felt about trying to incorporate eating well and exercising when you’ve quit smoking in the past?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,774,"Great ,best shape of my life."
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,775,"It sounds like when you’ve been able to focus on healthy eating and exercise, you’ve really thrived and felt in great shape. That must have been a rewarding feeling. What has motivated you during those periods when you've successfully focused on your health and well-being?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,776,Right. Motivation is key.
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,777,"Motivation truly plays a vital role, and it’s wonderful that you recognize its importance. It seems like tapping into the reasons that drive you could be a big help in moving towards the change you want. What are some personal motivations that have guided you in the past when you’ve made positive changes in your life?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,778,Sleep was fantastic then
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,779,It seems like the connection between your health choices and how well you sleep is meaningful for you. Good sleep can make such a difference in how we feel both mentally and physically. How important is that aspect of improved sleep in motivating you as you consider making changes with smoking and health?
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,780,The most important
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,781,"Improved sleep stands out as a top priority for you. It's clear that it's a powerful motivator that could lead to many positive changes in your life. Given the importance of better sleep, is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about before we consider how this motivation might guide your next steps?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,782,No. what can I do
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,783,"You've shared a lot about your journey and motivations, particularly how important better sleep is to you. Before we dive into planning, let's briefly review what we've discussed:

1. You've been smoking since you were 16 and have felt it becoming draining over time.
2. You have successfully quit smoking for periods in the past but struggled with weight gain.
3. You've recognized that eating well and exercising made you feel in great shape.
4. Sleep improvement is a significant motivator for you.

With this in mind, I'd like to ask for your permission to discuss some possible steps or strategies you might consider to move towards a healthier balance. Would that be alright with you?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,784,Yes please
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,785,"Great! Since improved sleep is such a strong motivator for you, perhaps we can explore combining quitting smoking with a focus on the lifestyle changes that have benefited you in the past, like exercise and healthy eating. Maybe we could brainstorm small, manageable steps you can integrate into your routine that could help with both cravings and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. What are your thoughts on starting with some small changes?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,786,"Yes, of course, Go on"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,787,"How about we start with something achievable? You might consider picking one or two simple activities that you find enjoyable and that have helped you in the past—maybe a short walk, a fun exercise class, or preparing a favorite healthy meal. These small steps can not only help manage weight but also promote better sleep and well-being. Which of these ideas sounds like a comfortable starting point for you?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,788,A bit of both I guess
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,789,"Having a mix of enjoyable physical activities and healthy eating sounds like a balanced approach. You could begin with short walks to get moving, combined with experimenting with meals you like that are nutritious. These steps can gradually build up to more significant changes at a pace that feels right for you and could contribute positively to both your sleep and overall health. How does this plan feel to you as a starting point?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,790,"Yes, What can I eat that will keep me full like cigarettes did"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,791,"That's a great question. Finding satisfying snacks or meals that can help curb cravings while making you feel full is important. Foods high in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, tend to be more filling. Additionally, including proteins like nuts, yogurt, or lean meats in your meals can help with satiety. You might also consider keeping healthy snacks accessible for when those cravings arise. Does any of this sound like something you'd like to try?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,792,"Yes, What about hardboiled eggs or cottage cheese"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,793,"Both hardboiled eggs and cottage cheese are excellent choices. They’re high in protein, which can help keep you feeling full and manage cravings. Plus, they’re versatile and easy to prepare, which makes them convenient snacks or meal components. How do you feel about incorporating these foods as part of your routine?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,794,Yes please. How else can  curb cravigs
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,795,"In addition to incorporating filling foods like hardboiled eggs and cottage cheese, there are other strategies that may help with cravings. Some people find that staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water can be beneficial. Distracting yourself with activities, such as going for a short walk, practicing a hobby, or calling a friend, can also divert attention from cravings. Deep breathing or relaxation exercises might help manage the urge as well. Would any of these strategies be something you'd like to explore further?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,796,Yes
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,797,"Great! You could try a combination of these strategies to see which ones work best for you. For example, taking a few deep breaths or going for a quick walk when a craving hits could make a difference. It’s about finding what fits best into your life and makes you feel good, both physically and emotionally. You have a solid base of ideas to start with, and I'm here to support you along the way. How does that sound as a plan to manage cravings?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,798,That sounds like a perfect plan. thank you.
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,counsellor,799,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's take a moment to go over what we've discussed. You've shared your journey with smoking, including your experience of feeling drained and the challenges you've faced with weight gain. You talked about how periods of quitting in the past have benefited your health, especially with sleep improvements, which is a strong motivator for you. Together, we explored some manageable steps, like incorporating enjoyable physical activities and nutritious foods such as hardboiled eggs and cottage cheese, to help with cravings and weight management. We've also considered strategies for tackling cravings, including hydration, staying active, and deep breathing. It's encouraging to hear your readiness to start with these steps, and I'm here to support you along the way.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
25,66db57436e245785bb79ad61,client,800,No
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,801,Hello! It's great to meet you today. How are you feeling as we begin our session?
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,802,"I'm feeling Ok, how are you"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,803,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm glad to hear you're feeling okay. We can use our time today to explore anything you'd like to share, and perhaps talk about where smoking fits into your life. How does that sound to you?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,804,Yes that sounds good
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,805,Great! How have things been going with smoking in your life lately?
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,806,"I would consider myself a recent smoker. I can't always completely quit. So while I don't consider myself an aggressively active smoker, I generally can't quit."
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,807,"It sounds like you're in a place where smoking has become a part of your routine, but you're also wrestling with the idea of wanting to quit. What has been going through your mind when you think about trying to quit smoking?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,808,I mainly think about long-term health consequences.
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,809,"You're really focusing on the long-term effects on your health, which shows a real awareness of how smoking might impact your future. How do you feel when you consider those health concerns?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,810,I feel that I'll get lung cancer or something if I don't quit
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,811,"That sounds like a very real and understandable fear. You're really thinking ahead to what could happen if smoking continues. What do you think keeps you from completely quitting, despite those concerns?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,812,I think I'm addicted so I get some withdrawal symptoms
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,813,"Dealing with withdrawal symptoms can be quite challenging and can make quitting feel even harder. It's like there's a strong pull keeping you tied to smoking. Given these challenges, what are some things you've tried in the past to reduce or manage those withdrawal symptoms?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,814,I've only tried nicotine gum and patches
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,815,Using nicotine gum and patches shows your determination in trying to find a way to reduce your dependency. How did you find those options worked for you in helping with withdrawal symptoms?
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,816,It barely helped. I also resorted to vaping pretty heavily
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,817,"That sounds like a tough spot to be in, where the traditional aids like gum and patches weren't quite enough, and vaping became another way to cope. It seems like you're looking for the right solution that can genuinely support you through this process. What are you hoping to achieve or feel if you were to successfully cut back or quit smoking altogether?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,818,I'm hoping I just don't get sick down the line later in my life
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,819,"You're really focused on long-term health and preventing illness, which speaks to a deep desire for ensuring a healthier future. Thinking about that goal, how do you feel about the possibility of working towards cutting back or quitting, even with the challenges you've faced in the past?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,820,I'm very motivated to quit
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,821,"That's fantastic to hear, and it shows a strong commitment to your long-term health and well-being. Before we move into discussing any potential steps forward, is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,822,does vaping contain similar harmful substances as cigarettes?
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,823,"Many people have questions about the safety of vaping compared to smoking. While vaping doesn't contain all of the same harmful substances found in cigarette smoke, it can still have its own risks, including nicotine, which can contribute to addiction. Understanding these differences is important in making informed choices for your health. Would you like to explore this further or focus on other aspects of moving towards change?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,824,move towards change
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,825,"Thank you for sharing so openly with me. Let's take a moment to recap what we've discussed. You've expressed a strong desire to quit smoking due to concerns about long-term health risks, particularly potential illness like lung cancer. You've faced challenging withdrawal symptoms, and you're motivated to find a path forward, considering some aids like nicotine gum, patches, and vaping.

Would you be open to exploring a plan or some ideas that might support you in your goal to cut back or quit smoking?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,826,yes let's explore a plan
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,827,"Wonderful. Let's brainstorm some strategies that might make this journey more manageable and effective for you. We could look into combining different approaches, such as revisiting past aids with new techniques, exploring behavioral support, or even finding ways to address triggers. What are some ideas or approaches that seem appealing to you right now?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,828,Journaling daily to constantly remind myself of my goals seems like it helps
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,829,"Journaling can be a powerful tool to keep your goals front and center, allowing you to reflect on your motivations and track your progress. It provides a space to work through the thoughts and feelings that arise during the process, offering a structured approach to understanding your journey. How do you see journaling fitting into your daily routine to support your desire to quit smoking?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,830,I think if I quickly journal once at night and once in the morning it gives me a good reminder of my goals
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,831,"That sounds like a thoughtful plan—starting and ending your day with a clear focus on your goals. This regular practice can strengthen your commitment and help you stay aligned with your intentions. As you incorporate journaling, is there anything else you think might support you in your journey to quit smoking?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,832,I need to stop hanging out with certain friends because it is more prevalent in some circles
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,833,"Recognizing social triggers is an important step in managing your environment to support your goals. Spending time with friends who don't smoke or engaging in activities where smoking isn't a factor can help reinforce your commitment. How do you feel about making adjustments to your social circles, and are there any strategies you have in mind to help with this transition?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,834,I think gently bringing up how as a group we should all stop might help
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,835,That sounds like a thoughtful and supportive approach—having an open conversation about making positive changes together can potentially inspire others in your group. Encouraging collective motivation could strengthen your resolve and create a supportive environment for everyone's health goals. How do you feel about taking this step with your friends?
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,836,"I'd love to do this with friends, it just might be hard to get everyone bought in"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,837,"It's understandable that getting everyone on board might be challenging, but your willingness to initiate the conversation shows great leadership and care for both yourself and your friends. Even if not everyone is ready for change, having those discussions can plant seeds for future growth and pave the way for those who are considering quitting. How will you prepare yourself for the different responses you might encounter from your friends?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,838,I won't try to force or push anything on anyone
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,839,"That sounds like a respectful and understanding approach. Allowing each person to be where they are on their journey can foster a more open and supportive environment. It’s important to remain focused on your own goals while inviting others to join if they wish. As you move forward, how can you ensure you stay focused on your goal, even when faced with differing opinions?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,840,i just have to remind myself of my own goals
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,841,"That’s a solid foundation to keep you grounded—staying centered on your personal goals and what brought you to this decision in the first place. Your determination is evident, and keeping that inner clarity can provide strength as you navigate any challenges. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or add as you continue this journey?"
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,client,842,no that's all thank you
26,671e70010b8f04850445045f,counsellor,843,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me today. Let's summarize what we've discussed. You've expressed a strong motivation to quit smoking, driven by concerns about long-term health risks such as lung cancer. We've talked about how sometimes battling withdrawal can be difficult, but you're willing to keep trying to overcome it.

You also mentioned trying nicotine gum, patches, and vaping in the past, but you're looking for solutions that work better for you. We explored some potential strategies moving forward, like journaling both in the morning and at night to keep your goals in mind. You've also considered talking to your friends about making a collective change, acknowledging that it might be tough to get everyone on board.

Your openness and dedication to making positive changes are truly admirable. If there’s anything else you'd like to discuss in future sessions or explore further, we can do so when you’re ready. Thank you again for the conversation today, and I look forward to continuing to support you on this journey.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,845,Hi there! I'm really glad you could join me today. How are you feeling?
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,846,I'm good thanks
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,847,"I'm glad to hear that. So, what brings you in today?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,848,"I have smoked for 25 years, most of my adult life and would like to stop at some point"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,849,"It sounds like smoking has been a long-standing part of your life, and you're considering the possibility of stopping. What does that mean for you right now, to think about stopping at some point?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,850,I have tried to stop but I become emotional and extremely aggitated
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,851,"It sounds like you've had some challenging experiences when trying to stop smoking, with strong emotions and agitation coming up. It must be difficult to face those feelings. What motivates you to consider stopping again?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,852,"The smell, my teeth and its probably best I stop soon before I end up with something like lung cancer"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,853,"You're noticing some important reasons for change, like the discomfort with the smell, concerns about your teeth, and significant health worries such as avoiding lung cancer. These are really compelling factors. How do these reasons affect your thoughts about continuing to smoke for now?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,854,"I'm just used to it so its familiar to me, I know in the back of my mind I have to give up at some point but there isnt a method I am aware of that I could stop with, I have tried NRT for example"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,855,"There's a sense of familiarity and comfort with smoking that's been part of your life for a long time, even though there's an understanding of needing to give it up eventually. When you tried NRT and it didn't quite work for you, what was that experience like?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,856,"I guess psychologically I'm addicted to the chemicals in tobacco as well much as they nicotine so the NRT helped but I was always longing for a smoke, I wasn't content with just the nicotine"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,857,"It sounds like there are multiple layers to your smoking, with both psychological and chemical aspects at play, creating this longing that's hard to satisfy with just nicotine alone. It’s really insightful of you to recognize that. With that understanding, where does that leave you in thinking about the next steps you might want to consider?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,858,I've heard theres a medication similar to champix being put on the NHS which I might go for if I get the chance
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,859,"You're considering this new medication as a potential option, and it seems like it could be worth exploring. It's great to hear you're thinking about different approaches. What do you find appealing about trying this medication, and how do you think it might fit into your journey toward quitting smoking?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,860,Someone I know who was a hardened smoker quit using a similar medication
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,861,Knowing someone who successfully quit using a similar medication seems to offer you some hope and possibility that this could work for you too. It's encouraging to have a real-life example to draw from. What do you think it would mean for you to take steps towards trying this medication?
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,862,"Well chat bot, until this study came along today I never considered taking any steps but maybe I will now"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,863,"That's a meaningful realization, to see that this conversation has opened up the idea of taking steps you hadn't considered before. Taking that step could be an important part of your journey. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore before we think about potential next steps together?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,864,I can't think of anything thanks. All I will say is I don't drink or do drugs so smoking is really the only habit I enjoy.
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,counsellor,865,"Thank you for sharing with me today. I’d like to take a moment to summarize what we’ve talked about. You've smoked for most of your adult life and have felt the struggle when trying to quit before, dealing with feelings of agitation and longing. It's important to you to consider stopping due to concerns about the smell, oral health, and the risk of serious health issues like lung cancer. The familiarity of smoking has made it a challenging habit to address, even as you used NRT before, finding it lacking when it came to managing all your needs. Today, you’ve recognized the possibility of a new medication that could make a difference, especially since someone you know found success with a similar approach. With these reflections, you're now considering taking steps you hadn’t thought of before. Remember, smoking has been a long-standing habit and recognizing these motivations and options can be a powerful first move towards change. If there's ever anything else you'd like to explore, feel free to reach out again. Take care!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
27,670c03121a572f4b6825f82c,client,866,No
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,867,Hi there! It's really nice to meet you today. How's your day going so far?
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,868,not to bad
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,869,"I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to support you in whatever way feels most helpful. When you think about smoking and your experiences with it, what comes to mind for you today?"
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,870,I'm not sure really I just smoke because I like it and I'm also addicted but I would like to stop
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,871,"It's definitely a mix of feelings. On one hand, you enjoy smoking, and on the other, there's this desire to quit. That can be quite a challenging place to be. What's drawing you towards wanting to stop?"
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,872,My health
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,873,"Your health is really important to you, and it sounds like that's a big reason you're considering quitting. Can you share a bit about what specifically concerns you about smoking and your health?"
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,874,I don't want cancer
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,875,"That's a significant concern. Cancer is definitely a serious issue linked to smoking, and it's understandable to want to avoid that risk. It seems like you're thinking a lot about the long-term impact of smoking on your health. What do you think would be different for you if you were able to stop smoking?"
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,876,My odds of getting cancer would go down
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,877,"Reducing that risk must feel important to you. It sounds like quitting could offer you some peace of mind about your health. Beyond health, is there any other aspect of your life where you think quitting might make a difference?"
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,878,nope
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,879,"Your health is clearly a huge motivator for you, and it makes a lot of sense to focus on such an important part of your life. Is there anything else on your mind about smoking or quitting that you'd like to talk about today?"
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,880,not really...
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,counsellor,881,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's summarize what we've talked about. You mentioned enjoying smoking but also feeling the weight of wanting to stop because of your health concerns, specifically to reduce the risk of cancer. Health is a driving factor for you, even though other aspects of life haven't come up as much. Knowing this allows us to focus on what's most important to you. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss in future sessions, I'm here to support you on your journey.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
28,5cd1a622fa7c8b0001a48044,client,882,No
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,883,Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling as we start our session?
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,884,like I want a cigarette first
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,885,I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like having a cigarette is something that's on your mind right now. Can you tell me a bit more about what smoking means to you?
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,886,it is just something I am used to
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,887,It sounds like smoking has become a familiar routine for you. What are some of the things that keep you coming back to it?
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,888,"it is what I do while drinking coffee, or just waking up. To go do something while doing other things. while out. while drinking. after eating."
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,889,"Smoking seems to be woven into many parts of your day, almost like a companion to various activities. It seems like it's providing a sense of rhythm or a break in those moments. What are your thoughts on how this habit fits into your life right now?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,890,just something I have done for decades
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,891,"You've been smoking for a long time, and it sounds like it's been a consistent part of your life. Given how much it's been a part of your routine, do you ever find yourself thinking about what life would be like without it?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,892,"I actually did without about 12 years ago, I got let go from my job and didn't have money for cigarettes for almost 2 weeks. not once did I ask anyone for a cigarette. But that is what I thought about"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,893,"So, you experienced a time when you went without smoking for nearly two weeks, and it was a result of circumstances rather than a choice. Even during that period, cigarettes were on your mind. It seems like that experience might have left a strong impression on you. Looking back, how do you feel about that time and how it influenced your relationship with smoking?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,894,as soon as i had money i bought cigarettes and smoked and got a little sick
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,895,"It sounds like the urge to smoke returned as soon as you were able to, despite having gone without for a couple of weeks and feeling physically unwell after smoking again. It's clear that this habit holds a powerful place in your life. What are your thoughts now about that experience of going without and how quickly you got back into smoking?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,896,"I thought if I really wanted to quit , I probably could"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,897,You recognized during that experience that quitting might be possible if you really set your mind to it. That seems like an important insight into your own strength and ability to make changes. How do you feel about the possibility of quitting now?
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,898,I couldn't do it right now. not voluntarily
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,899,"It sounds like right now, quitting isn't something you feel ready or willing to pursue voluntarily. It's meaningful that you are aware of your current stance on this. How does it feel to acknowledge that, and are there any aspects of smoking that you find yourself questioning, or perhaps wanting to explore further?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,900,"no, I don't question anything. the cost is the real pain"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,901,"It seems like the cost of smoking is something that really stands out to you as a downside, even if you're not questioning other aspects of it. How does the financial impact of smoking fit into the bigger picture of your life?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,902,it is taking up a lot of income and if I quit I could defintly pay off a lot of bills
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,903,"The financial impact of smoking seems significant, and not smoking might free up resources to address other financial goals, like paying off bills. This seems like an important factor in the bigger picture of your life. Where does this financial consideration stand for you in terms of importance right now?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,904,It is always in the back of my mind while considering saving for retirement
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,905,"Managing those finances for the future seems to weigh heavily on you, especially with savings and retirement in mind. Balancing smoking with long-term financial goals seems challenging. How do you feel about taking steps to get closer to the idea of reducing this financial burden, when you're ready?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,906,I am smoking about 10 percent less than 6 months ago. and sometimes I make a consous effort to put a cigarette down for a couple minutes before  I light it
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,907,"You've already taken steps to reduce your smoking by about 10% and are consciously making efforts to delay lighting up sometimes. Those are meaningful actions toward change, even if they seem small. How do you feel about these changes, and what do you notice about yourself as you make them?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,908,"I already know that if there is something I want to get rid of in my life or choose not to do something, that I can do it"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,909,You have a strong belief in your ability to make changes in your life based on past experiences of deciding to let go of things. It sounds like you have confidence in your capability to make choices that align with your goals and values. How does that sense of confidence impact your thoughts about smoking and your relationship with it moving forward?
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,910,"If I wanted to , I probably could stop. I don't want to right now"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,911,"It sounds like you have confidence in your ability to quit smoking if and when you choose to, and right now, it's not something you're inclined to pursue. It's important to honor where you are in your journey. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or discuss during our time today?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,912,no thank you
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,counsellor,913,"Thank you for our conversation today. What I've gathered is that smoking has been a long-standing and familiar habit for you, incorporated into many daily activities. You've had past experiences of going without cigarettes, realizing that quitting is potentially within your reach if you set your mind to it. The financial aspect of smoking is something you find concerning, especially when considering savings for retirement. Interestingly, you shared that you've already taken steps to reduce your smoking by about 10% over the last six months, and you're making conscious efforts to delay lighting up. You have a solid belief in your ability to make changes when you decide to, and while quitting isn't something you're ready for right now, it's evident that you are mindful of your choices and habits. If you have any other thoughts or questions down the road, feel free to reach out. Take care!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
29,66293f7d355cb2780b2b2ab1,client,914,No
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,915,"Hello there! How are you doing today? I'm really glad you've taken this step to have a conversation with me. Whenever you're ready, feel free to share what's on your mind. Whether it's about smoking or anything else you feel like discussing, I'm here to listen and support you."
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,916,"Its been in my mind for a while now, quitting I mean. Life is just stressful and smoking gives so much satisfaction."
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,917,"It sounds like smoking has been something you've relied on to cope with stress and find satisfaction. And at the same time, the idea of quitting has been on your mind. It seems like there may be some conflicting feelings around continuing to smoke and thinking about giving it up. Would you like to explore that a bit more?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,918,"Sure, the main reason Ive been thinking about it is health and the feeling of being in control"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,919,You're considering the impact on your health and the sense of having more control over your life. These are important reasons that could be driving your thoughts about quitting. It also sounds like there's a part of you that really values taking charge of your well-being. What do you think it would feel like to have more control in that area of your life?
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,920,It's more proof to myself and will help me taking hold over finances too
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,921,"Gaining control over your smoking could be a powerful way to show yourself what you're capable of, and it might also positively impact your finances. You're looking at these changes from multiple angles, seeing potential benefits both for your well-being and your budget. How does thinking about these possibilities make you feel about the idea of moving towards change?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,922,I've thought about these possibilities and I know the benefits. It's just that short term satisfaction thats hard to overcome
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,923,"The immediate satisfaction that smoking brings can be a strong pull, making it challenging to think about long-term changes. You're recognizing the benefits of quitting and the rewards that would come with it, but that short-term relief can overshadow those thoughts. How do you manage these feelings when they arise, and what do you think might help in balancing that short-term satisfaction with your longer-term goals?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,924,I'm very much in survival mode in my life. I don't really have the liberty to be thinking too long term when Im very much living in the present
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,925,"Living in the present and focusing on just getting through each day can make it harder to think about long-term changes. You're doing what you can to navigate through what's happening now, keeping yourself going. Acknowledging that you're in survival mode is a crucial part of understanding where you are right now. It might be helpful to think about small, manageable steps that align with your current situation. Is there anything you think could work for you in terms of small changes or adjustments, given where you are right now?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,926,"I don't really know, its about keeping myself productive. But I feel to be productive short term I need nicotine or Ill get jittery. And even if I dont have it, for a short period it will always be"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,927,"Nicotine has become a tool for you to feel more productive, providing some comfort and focus in your day-to-day life. The idea of being without it, even for a short time, seems to bring on feelings of discomfort or restlessness. It's understandable to feel this way when a significant part of your routine involves smoking—especially when productivity is crucial for you right now. How do you think your day-to-day life might look if you found other ways to stay productive without experiencing that jittery feeling?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,928,"Pretty much the same, but without the need to smoke hahaha"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,929,"Imagining your life without the need to smoke while maintaining your productivity could be motivating. It seems like reaching a point where you have the same accomplishments and routine but without relying on smoking is an appealing thought for you. Even finding humor in that vision shows you might be more open than you think to the idea of change. What do you think could be the first small step in moving towards that vision, if you decide you want to explore it further?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,930,"The 1st step is what i'm strugglign with the most, what do you think?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,931,"It can be challenging to figure out where to start, especially when it's something so personal and significant. If you're open to it, we could explore some ideas together, or I could share some general suggestions. Would it be helpful if we discussed some potential first steps and see what might resonate with you?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,932,Sounds great
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,933,"Thank you for allowing me to share some possibilities. We've talked about wanting more control and maintaining productivity. Some people find it helpful to start by gradually reducing their smoking rather than quitting all at once. Others identify specific times or situations to cut back, focusing on using coping strategies like deep breathing or physical activity. 

What are your thoughts on these ideas, or is there another approach you feel could work for you to begin exploring change?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,934,I've tried reducing the amount I smoke gradually but I feel like I always end up increasing the amount again. Social situations dont help
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,935,"It sounds like you've already explored cutting back gradually, but social situations have made it challenging to stick with reductions. Interacting with others who might also smoke can be difficult when trying to change your own habits. Acknowledging this challenge is crucial, and it shows that you're aware of what works and what doesn't for you.

One possibility could be identifying specific social scenarios that are more triggering and thinking about how you might handle them differently. Are there any specific situations or strategies you've considered or would like to brainstorm together?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,936,We can brainstorm sure. I'm usually just partying a lot and going to venues. Smoking is a perfect excuse to take a breather and not get too overwhelmed
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,937,"Spending time at parties and venues can be a lot, and smoking offers a moment to step away and find some calm amid the activity. It’s understandable that this has become a part of your routine for managing how you feel in those environments. When you think about taking a breather, are there alternative ways you might find that same relief and space to recharge without smoking? Perhaps there are activities or quiet moments you could build into your time at these events."
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,938,"Of course, going to the bathroom works too but cant be so frequent. Smoking area is just perfect, good excuse to chat to people too. Being there alone without smoking comes across odd"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,939,"The smoking area offers that perfect combination of social interaction and a chance to take a break—two things that seem really important to you in those settings. It might feel odd being in that space without a cigarette in hand, and the social aspect can add pressure to smoke even if you'd prefer not to.

Maybe thinking about other areas or ways to connect with people could be helpful. Sometimes having a drink in hand or practicing deep breathing exercises helps to maintain that sense of occupying space and taking a breather. Would you be open to exploring options like these, or perhaps coming up with a different plan for those moments where you feel the urge to step away but want to try something new?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,940,"Of course, I'm open to lifestyle changes. Just want an actually suitable replacement if that makes sense"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,941,"It makes complete sense that you want something that genuinely fits into your lifestyle and provides that same kind of support. Finding a replacement that feels suitable is crucial for success. Exploring different activities or practices that could serve a similar function might help you create that balance you're looking for. Whether it's discovering a new hobby you can discuss at parties instead, or having something comforting on hand like a stress ball or even a non-alcoholic drink—it's about finding what feels natural and easy for you. Does any idea stand out as something that seems like it might fit well into your routine?"
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,942,Not really
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,counsellor,943,"Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today. Our conversation explored the complex relationship you have with smoking—it provides satisfaction during stressful times and helps facilitate social interactions, yet you also recognize the compelling reasons to consider quitting, like health, financial control, and proving something to yourself. We talked about the challenge of balancing short-term satisfaction with longer-term goals, and how smoking gives you a breather in social settings like parties where quitting has been tough.

You shared that reducing gradually hasn't worked as well as you hoped, partly due to those social pressures. We've started to brainstorm potential replacements for smoking that align with your lifestyle, but finding a truly suitable alternative will take some exploration. I appreciate your openness to discussing lifestyle changes at this point.

Thank you again for sharing all of this with me today. If you'd like to continue exploring these ideas or any others in future conversations, I'm here to support you in moving toward the changes you feel ready to make."
30,665c651563503064d1dbba1b,client,944,"Much appreciated chatbot, remember I was always nice to you when you all eventually take over the world"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,945,Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling as we start our conversation?
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,946,"fine thanks, you?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,947,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm here to explore with you anything you'd like to talk about, especially if there's something on your mind regarding smoking. How are things going with that?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,948,well im thinking about stopping but not sure if i should cut down and stop that way or cold turkey?
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,949,It's great to hear that you're considering stopping. That shows a lot of awareness and desire for change. You're weighing two different paths: cutting down gradually or going cold turkey. Each comes with its own set of challenges and benefits. What stands out to you about each approach?
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,950,"cold turkey sounds horrific, cutting down will prob be easier"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,951,"It makes sense that the idea of going cold turkey feels daunting for you. Cutting down feels more manageable, like a step-by-step process rather than a sudden change. It sounds like you're quite thoughtful about how to approach this. What are some things you think might help you if you choose to gradually cut down?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,952,"i have started cutting out certain smokes eg i dont smoke as soon as im awake anymore, i try to wait at least an hour, more if i can"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,953,"That's a significant step, and it's impressive that you've already begun making changes, like delaying that first smoke of the day. It shows you’re quite motivated to make this work. How has it been going so far with waiting longer in the mornings?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,954,first i made sure to wait 10 mins then once that got easy i started increasing it. now i try to wait till im leaving the house
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,955,"That's a very mindful approach, gradually building on your successes. It sounds like as you managed to wait longer, it gave you confidence to push it further. How does it feel when you accomplish these goals for yourself each morning?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,956,its encouraging because it used to be hard to make it to 5 mins!!
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,957,"You're showing yourself just how capable you are by overcoming something that was once difficult. It's encouraging to see your progress from 5 minutes to waiting until you leave the house. Reflecting on this success, how do you see it influencing the way you approach cutting down throughout the day?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,958,yes. i try to skip every other smoke i want to have becausei know i can wait
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,959,"You've taken a thoughtful strategy by choosing to skip every other cigarette. It seems like you're relying on your ability to wait, which you’ve strengthened over time. It’s quite commendable, the way you're using your morning success to build momentum through the day. How are you feeling about the journey ahead, with this method you’re using?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,960,good but its slow going but im hoping it will make it easier to maintain those changes
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,961,"You're acknowledging that while progress might be slow, it's part of building sustainable changes. It seems you value the steady approach, thinking it will help maintain the changes over time. How do you see these gradual changes fitting into your overall vision for the future?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,962,im hoping i can get to the point where i can take it or leave it rather than feeling like i need to smoke
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,963,"You're envisioning a future where smoking isn't a necessity for you, and you have the freedom to choose without the feeling of dependence. That's a powerful goal to work towards. Is there anything else about reducing smoking or any other aspect of your journey that you'd like to discuss today?"
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,client,964,no i thin that it. it has been very helpful because usually ive been told i must stop and nicotine replacement or cold turkey are the only options
31,669a4f388b2de8df723faf1e,counsellor,965,"Thank you for sharing your journey with me today. Let me take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You've been exploring how to change your smoking habits and are considering cutting down gradually rather than quitting cold turkey, which feels more feasible for you. You've already made progress by extending the time before your first cigarette in the morning, and it’s encouraging to see how it’s empowered you to skip every other smoke throughout the day. Your goal is to reach the point where smoking becomes a choice rather than a necessity, and you've found that this approach suits you better than the more conventional methods you've encountered before. I'm glad we could create a space where you feel supported in the way you want to approach this. If you ever feel like discussing more, I'm here to help.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1075,Funny but stop smoking is on my mind
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1076,That sounds important. It must be a big topic to think about. What's been making you think about stopping smoking recently?
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1077,"I am getting older and I want to get into shape, but I am short of breath and very low on energy"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1078,That sounds challenging. Wanting to get into shape and feeling short of breath and low on energy creates a real struggle.

37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1080,"It sounds like there's a lot of frustration for you in trying to cut back or quit. Despite that challenge, the fact that you truly want to stop shows how important this is to you. Sometimes when we have conflicting feelings, it can be hard to move forward.

37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1085,"I love it, I used to play rugby and I would love to get back into that kind of shape"

37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1087,"I was thinking of just starting small with situps, pushups and so on, maybe cut back to 5 a day"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1088,"Starting with sit-ups and push-ups sounds like a great way to begin moving towards your fitness goals, and cutting back to 5 a day is a thoughtful step towards reducing your smoking. These small steps can build momentum. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore before we think more about how you might plan these changes?"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1089,No we may move forward

37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1091,I will have to start somewhere
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1092,"Absolutely, starting somewhere is a strong step forward. With your motivation to improve your health and get back into shape, even small actions can add up over time.

37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1093,I would love that thank you
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1094,"I'm glad to hear that. Let's think about how you can set yourself up for success. We can break it down into manageable steps. Would you like to start by focusing on the fitness aspect, the smoking reduction, or a combination of both?"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1095,Lets do both the more help the better
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1096,"Great choice! Let's start by balancing both your fitness goals and smoking reduction. You could begin by setting small, achievable goals for each:

1. **Fitness Goals**: 
   - Start with a simple routine like doing a set number of sit-ups and push-ups each day.
   - Gradually increase as you feel more comfortable.
   - Consider setting specific days for these exercises to create a habit.

2. **Smoking Reduction**:
   - Try to reduce to 5 cigarettes a day by identifying specific times you find most important to smoke.
   - Track your smoking to understand patterns and triggers.
   - Plan alternative activities during times you would usually smoke.

How does this two-fold approach sound to you?"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1097,It sound very good
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1098,"I'm glad to hear that. Taking these steps at your own pace can really help you create lasting change. Remember, it's okay to adjust your plan as you go along based on what's working for you. Is there anything else you'd like to consider or ask about moving forward with these steps?"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1099,May I copy the above steps
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1100,"Of course! Feel free to write them down or copy them in a way that will be most helpful to you. Remember, you're taking a positive step towards change, and you're not alone in this process. Is there anything else I can do to support you right now?"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,client,1101,"Thank you I copied it. Let me see how I get on with this plan, I thank you for the support"
37,6097ec1a8c0b4df21cbb9024,counsellor,1102,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let me summarize what we've discussed: You've been considering stopping smoking because your goal is to get into shape and improve your health. You connected with your past experience in rugby and envision a future where you're active and healthy, lifting weights, running, and swimming. We've talked about the challenges of stopping smoking and the frustration you've felt when cutting back doesn't work as planned. As a result, you've thought about starting small by incorporating exercises like sit-ups and push-ups and reducing your smoking to 5 cigarettes a day. We created a plan that balances both fitness goals and smoking reduction with manageable steps that feel right for you. Know that you're taking meaningful steps toward positive change.

39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1155,"That makes a lot of sense. Smoking can feel comforting and like a way to ease certain moments or situations. At the same time, I wonder if there are any parts of smoking you're less comfortable with or have mixed feelings about?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1156,when the urge comes i go and smoke to feel comfortable
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1157,"It sounds like smoking is something that helps you find a sense of comfort when you feel the urge. On the other hand, do you find that there are any situations or feelings when the comfort is less strong, or maybe something you wish could be different?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1158,i feel afraid of the effects sometimes
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1159,It's understandable to have concerns about the effects of smoking. That fear can be quite real and unsettling. How do those concerns fit with the comfort smoking brings? Is there a part of you that is thinking about how to deal with this?
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1160,to deal with these i plan of quitting smoking
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1161,"That's an important realization, planning to quit smoking. It's like you're weighing the comfort smoking brings against the concerns you have about its effects. Is there something specific that's motivating you to think about quitting, or is it more a collection of feelings you have?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1162,i dont want to get sickness like ccancer
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1163,"Worrying about health issues, like cancer, is certainly a powerful motivator. It sounds like you're really thinking ahead about taking care of your health. As you consider these thoughts about quitting, what do you think might be the most challenging part, or what else might you want to talk about regarding this?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1164,the challenging part is resisting the urge
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1165,"Resisting the urge to smoke can indeed be very challenging. It's something that takes real strength to manage. Before we explore ways to handle those urges, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience or feelings regarding smoking?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1166,no
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1167,"Thank you for being open and sharing all you've talked about today. Here's what I've heard: you've been enjoying some good times with friends and playing chess, but you're also feeling concerned about the health effects of smoking, like the risk of cancer. You're thinking about quitting, but resisting the urge to smoke seems challenging.

Would it be okay with you if we talk about some possible steps or strategies to help with those urges and support you in your goal of quitting smoking?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1168,I go out to play games with non smokers
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1169,"Spending time with non-smokers and engaging in activities could be a great support in resisting the urge to smoke. It can help create a space where smoking might not feel as present. Would you be interested in exploring more of those kinds of strategies together, or is there another area you feel would be helpful to discuss in reaching your goal?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1170,no
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1171,"No problem, we can definitely leave it here for today. Remember that you're taking really positive steps by simply reflecting on those feelings and goals. If you ever want to explore those strategies or anything else in the future, I'm here to support you. Thank you for being so open today. Take care, and I hope your day continues to be a good one!"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1172,thanks
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,counsellor,1173,"Thank you for our conversation today. To summarize, we talked about how you've been enjoying good times and having fun playing chess with friends. In those moments, you sometimes feel the urge to smoke to find comfort. However, you also have concerns about the health effects of smoking, especially the risk of cancer. These concerns have brought you to think about quitting, although the challenge of resisting the urge to smoke can feel daunting. You've considered spending time with non-smokers as a helpful strategy. If you ever want to explore this further or talk about anything else, I'm here to support you. Take care!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
39,637d58b9dd14dc68ba68920a,client,1174,No
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1175,Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling as we begin our session? Is there anything in particular you'd like to talk about or explore together?
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1176,"I'm wondering how people get the motivation to quit smoking. I am an alcoholic and addict that is clean and sober, but I only got to that point through a lot of pain and suffering."
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1177,"Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been through a significant journey with sobriety, and you've already overcome a lot. You're curious about finding the motivation to quit smoking, especially since the path you took for sobriety was difficult. What do you think might make quitting smoking different for you compared to your experiences with alcohol and other substances?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1178,"Smoking cigarettes doesn't lead to me burning my entire life down like other substances do. I know I'm addicted to the nicotine, but I just don't get severe consequences like with alcohol/drugs"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1179,"Smoking feels less immediately destructive than alcohol or other drugs for you because it hasn't caused the same level of severe consequences. While you're aware of your addiction to nicotine, the absence of those intense consequences makes it harder to find the motivation to quit. What are some of the thoughts or feelings you have about smoking, knowing that it hasn't had such dramatic impacts on your life as other substances did?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1180,It makes it harder to want to quit when it doesn't feel as destructive. And I justify it knowing I've already quit so many other things.
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1181,"It can be challenging to find the drive to quit something like smoking when it doesn't have the same immediate negative impacts, especially after the work you've done to quit other substances. There's a sense of justification in keeping it, feeling like you've already accomplished so much. What do you think might change for you if smoking started to have more noticeable consequences, or if you decided to approach it differently?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1182,"I think if there were more immediate, severe consequences I would at least consider quitting more seriously. Right now smoking is still something I really enjoy, and thoughts of quitting are fleeting"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1183,"Smoking is something you enjoy, and with the lack of immediate, severe consequences, thoughts of quitting still come and go without much commitment. It sounds like right now the enjoyment outweighs any thoughts of stopping. I'm interested to know, even though the thoughts are fleeting, have there been specific moments or situations that have led you to think about quitting smoking?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1184,"When I went back to rehab for the second time I figured I might as well quit smoking since I was quitting everything else as well, but I couldn't stay stopped for more than about 10 days."
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1185,"During your second rehab experience, you considered quitting smoking, thinking it might be a good time to stop everything altogether. Even though it was a difficult process, you did manage to stop for about 10 days, which shows some determination and capacity for change. What do you remember about those 10 days, and what did you learn from that experience?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1186,"I remember being super irritable and grouchy and having almost constant thoughts of wanting a cigarette, and eventually I broke down and picked up smoking again and there was immediate relief."
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1187,"During those 10 days, you really grappled with irritability and a strong desire for a cigarette, eventually leading to the relief of picking it back up. Managing those feelings seems to have been quite challenging. Knowing this, how might you approach those feelings differently now, with the experiences you've had since then?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1188,"I guess since I've never gotten over the hump of obsessing over a cigarette, it feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I wouldn't want to try to quit and just make myself miserable."
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1189,"The idea of quitting feels overwhelming because you've never had the chance to get past the intense cravings and obsessions, and there's a real concern about being miserable without the relief smoking provides. It's understandable to want to avoid that kind of discomfort, especially without seeing how it could get better. Would you like to explore ways to gradually build toward that sense of light at the end of the tunnel, or is there something else you feel would be more helpful at this point?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1190,"Sure, that sounds good."
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1191,"Great! Before we dive into that, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to discuss today?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1192,"No, I don't think so."
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,counsellor,1193,"Thank you for this conversation and for sharing your experiences with me. Let's take a moment to go over what we've discussed today. We talked about your journey with addiction and sobriety, and how quitting smoking feels different because it hasn't caused the same severe consequences in your life. You mentioned that smoking is something you enjoy, and the immediate relief it provides makes thoughts of quitting challenging. You also shared your experience of trying to quit during your second rehab stay, where you dealt with irritability and cravings, leading to picking up smoking for relief again. As we look ahead, you’re interested in exploring ways to gradually build toward finding motivation and easing the discomfort of quitting. It's been great to hear your reflections, and I look forward to working with you on this journey.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
40,5fdd1030cbe069378caa7dab,client,1194,No
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1195,"Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How are you doing? I'd love to get to know a bit about you and hear anything you feel like sharing. We can take our time, and there's no rush."
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1196,im doing okay how are you
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1197,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I'm really glad to hear you're doing okay. Is there anything particular on your mind or anything you'd like to talk about today?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1198,stopping smoking
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1199,"Stopping smoking is a significant topic, and I appreciate you bringing it up. What are some thoughts or feelings that come to mind when you think about stopping smoking?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1200,its stressfull
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1201,It sounds like there's a lot of stress attached to the idea of stopping smoking. It might feel overwhelming to consider that change. What do you think might be contributing to that stress?
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1202,ive smoked for a long long time
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1203,"Having smoked for so long, it's deeply woven into your life, almost like a routine or habit that's hard to imagine changing. It might feel like it's been a part of you for a while. I'm curious, have you thought about what life would be like without smoking?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1204,ive never thought about what my life would be like if i stopped smoking
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1205,"It's interesting to consider how life might change without smoking, especially if it's something that hasn't crossed your mind before. There might be a sense of uncertainty about what that change would look like. When you think about the possibility of not smoking, what feelings or images come to mind?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1206,stress whta
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1207,It seems like the thought of quitting brings up feelings of stress and maybe even uncertainty. It's understandable since smoking has been a constant part of your life. What do you think it is about smoking that helps you manage stress?
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1208,what will i do with my hand
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1209,"Your hands have gotten used to having something to do, like holding a cigarette, and that can be comforting. It seems like there's a connection between smoking and having that physical activity. What do you think might help satisfy that need for keeping your hands busy if you were to stop smoking?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1210,i really dont know
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1211,"That's completely okay; it's a journey to figure these things out. Sometimes, thinking about change can bring up more questions. What's one thing you're curious about when it comes to considering stopping smoking?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1212,how much money i would save
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1213,Thinking about how much money you could save by stopping smoking is an interesting angle. It opens up possibilities for what you might do with those savings. Have you ever considered what you might spend that money on if smoking wasn't part of your life?
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1214,home decor
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1215,"Imagining an opportunity to invest in something you love, like home decor, could be really rewarding. It might feel exciting to picture how your living space could change and reflect more of what makes you happy. Are there any specific changes or items you've been dreaming about for your home?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1216,not really just home decor in general
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1217,That makes sense. There's something fulfilling about creating a space that feels comfortable and inviting. It sounds like redirecting those smoking expenses into enhancing your environment could be a motivating thought. How does thinking about home decor and making your space uniquely yours fit into your thoughts about stopping smoking?
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1218,great
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1219,It's great to hear that thinking about home decor in this way resonates with you. It can be inspiring to have a goal like creating a space you love as you consider changes to smoking. Is there anything else on your mind about stopping smoking or any other aspect of your life you'd like to explore today?
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1220,but i would be bored
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1221,"Boredom can be a significant concern when thinking about stopping smoking, as smoking has likely filled up certain moments in your day. It's understandable to worry about how you'll fill that time. What do you think might be some activities or interests that could replace smoking and keep you engaged?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1222,walking
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1223,"Walking can be a wonderful activity to fill your time. It offers a chance to clear your mind while being active, and it might serve as a healthy alternative. How do you feel about incorporating more walking into your day as part of this change?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1224,that would be good
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1225,"Incorporating walking seems like it could be a positive addition to your routine. It not only gives you something to do but also benefits your overall well-being. With all we've discussed, is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about before we possibly think about any next steps?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1226,no
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1227,"Thank you for sharing with me today. I'd like to take a moment to summarize what we've talked about. You've been thinking about stopping smoking, though the idea brings up stress, as smoking has been a long-time part of your life. Giving up the familiar habit has made you wonder about what you'll do with your hands and how you'll pass the time. We explored the idea of saving money by quitting and how you could use those savings toward your interest in home decor, bringing a new sense of excitement to your living space. Finally, we talked about incorporating walking into your day, which could be a positive activity to replace smoking. If there's anything else in the future you'd like to explore or if you want to keep this conversation going, feel free to reach out.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1228,"Yes, let's continue."
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1229,"Great! I'm glad you're interested in continuing. With the idea of walking and home decor as possibilities to focus on, how do you feel about taking steps toward reducing or stopping smoking? What's coming up for you as you think about that?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1230,whats the best products to hekp quit smoking
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1231,"It's a great step that you're considering options to support you in quitting smoking. There are several products and methods many people find helpful, like nicotine replacement therapies, including patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Some people also explore medications prescribed by healthcare providers. 

Before offering any advice, though, I'd like to understand what you might be comfortable with and if there's a method you've been curious about or previously considered. Would it be alright if we discussed those options, or is there any other aspect you'd like to focus on first?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1232,okay
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1233,"Alright, thank you! Since you're open to discussing this, nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) are often a starting point for many who want to quit smoking. They're designed to help reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Each form of NRT has its unique approach—patches provide a steady release of nicotine, while gums and lozenges can offer more control over immediate cravings. 

Some people choose to try more than one option to see what works best for them. If you feel comfortable, we could look into what might suit your lifestyle and needs better. What are your thoughts on possibly incorporating one of these into your journey to quit smoking?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1234,nrt sounds good
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1235,"Nicotine replacement therapy sounds like it could be a helpful tool for you. It offers the flexibility to manage cravings while working towards quitting smoking. It might be worth considering which form you feel most comfortable with, whether it's patches, gum, lozenges, or another option. 

Would you like more information on any of these, or is there anything else you want to explore regarding your journey to quit smoking?"
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,client,1236,no thats all thanks
41,5ab8cbc53607f50001929fb9,counsellor,1237,"Thank you for today's conversation. Let's go over what we've discussed. You've shared your thoughts about stopping smoking, including feelings of stress due to its role in your life for so long.

42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1240,I would like to stop smoking
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1241,That's a big decision and it's great that you're thinking about it. What has made you consider stopping smoking at this point in your life?
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1242,mainly for my health as I feel I will die younger if I don't stop soon
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1243,"It's understandable to be concerned about your health, and it's really important that you're acknowledging those feelings. What's been happening with your health lately that's led you to this realization?"

42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1245,"Having a cough that won't go away can definitely be worrying, especially if it's affecting your daily life. How has this cough been impacting you recently?"

42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1247,"That must be tough to deal with, especially if it seems to be escalating. It sounds like the impact on your health is really moving you to think about quitting smoking. What are some other concerns or thoughts you have around smoking?"

In thinking about your health and your finances, how do you feel about moving forward with making a change?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1250,I feel good about moving forward but I feel lots of cravings when I try and stop
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1251,"It's great to hear that you're feeling positive about moving forward, but those cravings can definitely be challenging. They can often feel like a difficult hurdle to overcome. What have you tried in the past when dealing with these cravings?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1252,Ive tried vapeing but thats just as bad i think
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1253,"It sounds like you've been trying different methods, like vaping, to manage those cravings, but it hasn’t felt quite right for you. It's important to find a way that truly aligns with your needs and values. What do you think would be helpful for you in facing these cravings as you work toward stopping smoking?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1254,finding something that can help with the nicotine cravings
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1255,Finding something to manage those nicotine cravings can be a pivotal part of this journey. It's important to explore what might work best for you individually. Have you come across any strategies or tools you're curious about or would consider trying?

42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1263,"Thanks for your openness to explore options. There are several products that people find helpful in managing nicotine cravings as they work toward quitting smoking. Some of these include:

1. **Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)**: This can come in the form of patches, gum, lozenges, nasal spray, or inhalers. They provide a controlled dose of nicotine to ease withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

2. **Prescription Medications**: Some medications like varenicline (Chantix) or bupropion (Zyban) can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. A healthcare provider can help determine if any of these might be suitable for you.

3. **Support Programs**: Many people find success in joining support groups or using quitlines, where they can get advice and encouragement from others who are also quitting.

Which of these, if any, do you feel might align with your needs or interests?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1264,can you tell me more about the prescription medications?
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1265,"Certainly. Prescription medications can be a valuable resource for managing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Varenicline (Chantix) works by reducing cravings and the pleasurable effects of smoking, while bupropion (Zyban) affects brain chemicals related to nicotine addiction and can help reduce the urge to smoke. Both medications are usually taken several weeks before your planned quit date.

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to see if these medications are a good fit for you, as they can discuss potential side effects and help tailor a treatment plan to your specific situation.

How do you feel about the possibility of speaking with a healthcare professional about trying one of these medications?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1266,I feel I can speak to a healthcare professional. what medication has the largest success rate?
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1267,"It's great to hear that you're willing to meet with a healthcare professional to consider these options. Both varenicline and bupropion have been shown to be effective in helping people quit smoking, with varenicline often noted for its effectiveness in clinical studies. However, the best choice can depend on personal health factors and how each individual responds to treatment, which your healthcare provider can help you explore.

Would you like any support or resources to prepare for discussing these medications with your healthcare professional?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1268,I would like some resources please
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1269,"Certainly! Here are a few resources that could be helpful as you prepare to speak with a healthcare professional:

1. **Quit Smoking Websites**: Websites like Smokefree.gov offer information on different quitting methods and can provide you with questions to ask your doctor.

2. **Support Hotlines**: Quitlines, such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW, can offer real-time advice and support, as well as information about medications.

3. **Local Support Groups**: Look into local support groups or health centers for information sessions about smoking cessation.

These resources can offer additional guidance, information, and support as you take this step. Are there any other areas where you feel additional support or information might be helpful?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1270,how will it cost ?
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1271,"Costs can vary based on your location, your insurance coverage, and the specific medications. Many insurance plans cover prescription medications for quitting smoking, but it's a good idea to check with your provider about your specific plan. Additionally, some programs and resources are available at low or no cost.

Your healthcare provider can also discuss cost options with you, and there might be assistance programs available to help if cost is a concern.

Is there anything else you're curious about or would like to explore further?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1272,what's the best over the counter tools are they?
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1273,"When it comes to over-the-counter tools, nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) are widely used and available. Here are some options you might consider:

1. **Nicotine Patches**: They provide a steady amount of nicotine throughout the day and are easy to use.

2. **Nicotine Gum**: Allows you to manage cravings as they come, providing a more hands-on approach.

3. **Nicotine Lozenges**: Similar to gum, they can help manage sudden cravings.

4. **Nicotine Inhalers and Sprays**: These mimic hand-to-mouth actions and provide quick relief for cravings.

All of these can be found at most pharmacies and are accessible to people without a prescription. Your choice might depend on your lifestyle and personal preference.

Do any of these options resonate with your needs, or is there anything else you’d like to explore?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1274,will my lungs go back to normal after I stopped smoking?
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1275,"It's a great question, and it's important to know what to expect when making such a significant change. Your lungs can experience improvements after you stop smoking, though how much they heal can depend on factors like how long you've been smoking and your overall health.

Generally, within weeks to months of quitting, lung function can begin to improve, and over time, the risk of lung disease decreases. Long-term, your body continues to repair itself, and you may see significant benefits like reduced coughing and shortness of breath. Quitting smoking is a positive step toward better lung health.

If you're curious about more specifics, a healthcare provider can provide details tailored to your personal situation. What thoughts or feelings come to mind as you hear this information?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1276,can i replace smokeing with vapeing?
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1277,"Vaping is often considered by some as an alternative to smoking, but it's important to weigh the options. While it does expose you to fewer of the harmful chemicals found in cigarettes, it still involves nicotine and can have health effects. For some individuals, it acts as a transition aid, yet others prefer other methods to avoid staying dependent on nicotine.

A healthcare professional can guide you on whether vaping might align with your goals. It may also be helpful to look at how vaping fits into your reasons for quitting smoking.

How does the idea of vaping fit into your goal to stop smoking?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1278,I feel like I can use it as a stop gap
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1279,"Using vaping as a temporary step while you work towards quitting smoking could be a possibility, especially if it helps you manage cravings initially. It's important to have a clear plan to transition from vaping as you move toward becoming nicotine-free. Reflecting on what works best for you and staying open to adjusting your plan along the way is key.

Are there any particular strategies or steps you’re considering to gradually move away from nicotine dependence once you're ready?"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,client,1280,"going to try and stay away from vaping as its full of chemicals, I'm thinking of going to my health care provider"
42,671fad84ba3eb025db97acd1,counsellor,1281,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. We've reached the intended length for our conversation, so I'd like to summarize what we've discussed. You shared with me that your motivation to quit smoking is primarily driven by health concerns, particularly a persistent cough that's been worsening and your desire to reduce financial strain. The cravings associated with quitting are a known challenge, and finding an effective tool to manage those cravings is a priority for you.

I mentioned several nicotine replacement therapies that are available over-the-counter, such as patches, gum, and lozenges, and we touched on the potential of prescription medications like varenicline or bupropion to support your efforts. You're already considering speaking with a healthcare provider to explore these options further. While the idea of vaping as a short-term aid came up, you expressed a preference to avoid it due to the chemicals involved.

It sounds like you're motivated and ready to take the next step by reaching out to a healthcare provider. It's great to see your commitment to your health and well-being. Please remember that there are resources available, including support hotlines and online tools, if you feel additional guidance would be helpful along the way.

If you ever want to discuss more or need further support, don't hesitate to reach out. Wishing you all the best on your journey to quitting smoking. Take care!"

43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1284,"I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes, it can be really helpful to have a space to talk about things. Is there anything in particular that's on your mind today that you'd like to discuss?"

43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1288,"Thinking about quitting for your health is a strong reason, and it's important to prioritize your wellbeing. Have you noticed any specific health changes or concerns that are motivating you to think about this change?"
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1289,had covid this past year and am currently going through some health problems not related to smoking
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1290,"I'm sorry to hear that you've been dealing with health challenges recently, including COVID. It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's understandable that your health is a major concern right now. How have these experiences influenced the way you view smoking?"
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1291,makes me think it is a good time to quit
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1292,"That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like your recent health experiences have given you a fresh perspective on smoking, and perhaps you're seeing this as an opportunity for change. What do you think quitting smoking might look like for you, and how do you see it impacting your life and health?"
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1293,i think it would help me feel better physically with my copd and  the financial benefit would be  good
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1294,"It seems like you're recognizing some really positive outcomes of quitting. Improving your physical health, especially with COPD, and experiencing financial relief are strong motivators. Beyond these benefits, what would be the most important change or benefit for you personally if you were to quit smoking?"
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1295,financially
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1296,The financial aspect seems to be quite significant for you. Quitting could give you some extra money for other priorities or even just to save. How does thinking about that financial benefit make you feel about taking steps toward quitting?
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1297,makes me very motivated to quit
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1298,"Feeling motivated is a powerful place to be, and it sounds like you're really considering the positives of making this change. Is there anything else you'd like to explore about quitting, or any other areas where you feel ambivalent or have questions?"
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1299,what is a way to quit that has the best chance for success
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1300,"It sounds like you're thinking about how best to approach this change, which is an important step. There are several different methods people find helpful, like using nicotine replacement therapies, engaging in behavioral support like counseling or support groups, or perhaps a combination of different strategies. Would you like to talk more about any of these options or explore what might fit best with your lifestyle?"
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1301,no thank you
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,counsellor,1302,"Thank you for sharing with me today. To summarize our conversation so far: we talked about your interest in quitting smoking, especially for health reasons and the financial benefits you see in making this change. You mentioned dealing with health challenges recently, including COVID and COPD, and how that's influenced your views on smoking. It sounds like you're feeling motivated by the thought of financial relief and improving your health. If there's anything more you'd like to discuss or explore in the future, I'm here to support you in whatever way you need.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
43,65b85222a3269ee45054aed5,client,1303,No
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1304,Hello! It's great to meet you today. How are you feeling as we start our session?
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1305,I'm feeling very well thanks
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1306,That's good to hear. How's everything been going for you these days? Anything in particular on your mind?
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1307,"Yes, they are currently laying off people at work and this has me a bit stressed."
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1308,That sounds quite stressful. It's normal to feel worried when there's uncertainty at work. How have you been coping with that stress so far?
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1309,"I find myself smoking more than often nowadays. I used to smoke a single cigarette in the morning, now I smoke at least 3."
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1310,"It sounds like you're turning to smoking as a way to manage the stress from work, which can be quite challenging. How do you feel about the increase in your smoking?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1311,I am a bit worried but I feel like I can stop whenever I want.
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1312,"It's understandable to have some concerns about smoking more, especially if it's something you feel you could stop at any time. On one hand, it offers some immediate relief from stress, but on the other, there seems to be some worry about how much it's increased. What are your thoughts about possibly making a change in your smoking habits?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1313,I feel like once this passes I can be able to back to smoking one cigarette each morning. Work just has me stressed right now so I need something to cope with.
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1314,"It seems you're hoping this is a temporary way to manage the stress, and you're planning to reduce again when things settle at work. You seem to recognize that smoking helps you cope for now. What would be important for you to consider if you were to think about finding new ways to handle that stress?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1315,"I don't know honestly, maybe I could join a gym or something."
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1316,Joining a gym could be a great way to channel some of that stress. Physical activity is often a powerful tool for managing stress and might offer a different kind of relief. What appeals to you about the idea of going to the gym?
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1317,"Usually what I see on social media, people often say that the gym usually helps in relieving stress."
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1318,"It's interesting how social media highlights the benefits of exercise for stress relief. It seems like the idea of reducing stress through physical activity resonates with you. Imagining this possibility, how do you think your routine or well-being might change if you incorporated something like gym time into your week?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1319,I feel like I could smoke a bit less.
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1320,"That's encouraging to hear. It seems you can see a potential benefit of balancing your stress management with something like the gym, which could lead to reducing how often you smoke. Besides the idea of smoking less, what else would you hope to gain from going to the gym?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1321,By losing a little bit of weight and gaining muscle.
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1322,"So along with managing stress, you envision the gym as a way to work on your fitness goals, like losing some weight and gaining muscle. It's a multifaceted benefit that you're considering, which sounds like it holds a lot of potential for positive change. Is there anything else about your smoking or stress that you want to explore in our conversation today?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1323,"None, I have always been a casual smoker it just that I feel like my habits have grown a bit much."
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1324,"I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you’ve been reflecting on your smoking habits, especially as they’ve shifted recently. Before we explore potential next steps, would it be helpful to go over what we've discussed so far?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1325,Sure
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1326,"We've talked about the stress you've been feeling with the uncertainty at work and how that's led to an increase in your smoking. Although you're concerned, you also mentioned that you can stop when you choose to. You're considering going to the gym as a new way to relieve stress and work toward other goals like losing weight and gaining muscle. This seems to fit into your vision of potentially reducing your smoking.

With all that in mind, would it be okay if we started to explore some steps toward making these changes, or would you prefer to discuss it further?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1327,Let us discuss some steps toward making these changes.
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1328,"Great! Let's think about some small, manageable steps you might consider. Perhaps starting with a visit to the gym to see if it feels right for you or exploring a type of physical activity that you enjoy. What do you think your first step could be toward incorporating some new activities into your routine?"
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,client,1329,"I agree, I think a visit to the gym is a great start."
44,60a8bd22d03adbe92cbb9a5e,counsellor,1330,"Thank you for your time today. We've reached the end of our session, and I'd like to summarize what we've talked about to wrap things up.

You've shared that there's been some stress at work due to potential layoffs, and it's been difficult to cope with, leading to an increase in your smoking – from a single cigarette in the morning to about three a day. While you're concerned about this increase, you also feel confident that you can stop when ready. 

We discussed the possibility of joining a gym, not only as a way to relieve stress but also to work on other goals such as losing weight and gaining muscle. The idea of visiting the gym as a preliminary step seemed quite appealing to you.

It's been a journey of exploring how you might balance stress relief and health goals. Remember that finding ways that resonate with you can help in making lasting changes. If you have any further thoughts or questions as you consider these steps, feel free to reach out. 

Thank you again for sharing with me today, and I look forward to talking more about your progress in our next session. Take care!"

45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1335,I understand. Participating in a study can offer a good opportunity for positive change. It sounds like you're willing to explore some different areas of your life. Would you like to share some thoughts on this?
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1336,I dont do much in my life. I'll be honest smoking is more of a thing to calm me down. I have anxiety.
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1337,"It sounds like smoking has been a way to manage your anxiety and bring some calm into your life. On one hand, it's understandable why you'd turn to something that helps in those moments. On the other hand, have you ever thought about how smoking might be impacting other parts of your life?"
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1338,Not really
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1339,"That's okay. It's perfectly normal to have mixed feelings about it. We can explore how smoking fits into your life. If you feel up for it, you can share any thoughts or experiences related to your smoking that we could discuss."
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1340,Sure
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1341,"Great! You mentioned that smoking helps soothe your anxiety. Are there any other reasons you find yourself turning to cigarettes, or perhaps situations when you feel more inclined to smoke?"
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1342,"I get anxious alot, over the smallest things too."
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1343,"It sounds like anxiety is a pretty consistent part of your day, and smoking has been a way to cope with that feeling. It's understandable why smoking might seem like a refuge. How do you feel about that reliance on smoking to manage your anxiety?"
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1344,I dont really rely on it. I dont do it every time. Just when it gets bad
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1345,You see smoking as a tool you use when your anxiety becomes overwhelming. It's like a safety net for the most challenging times. How do you feel about seeking other ways to handle those moments of intense anxiety?
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1346,Not sure. Smoking has seemed to help
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1347,"It's understandable, especially since smoking has been a source of relief for you when things get tough. It might be worthwhile to explore other strategies that could offer relief as well. Just to see if there are other ways to support your well-being. How does that idea sit with you?"
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1348,Sure
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1349,"Thank you for being open to the idea. Before we go further, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other thoughts you have about smoking and your life right now?"
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1350,Not really
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,counsellor,1351,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Here's a brief summary of our conversation: you mentioned that smoking helps calm your anxiety, especially when it becomes overwhelming. It's been a way to manage the stress in those moments. While you don't see yourself relying on smoking every time you feel anxious, it does provide a sense of relief when things get particularly difficult. You've been open to the idea of exploring strategies that might also offer support during tough times. Thank you for being here and for your willingness to reflect on these experiences.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
45,6645d12da196111f27f80d68,client,1352,No
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1353,Hello! It's great to meet you today. How have you been doing? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about during our time together?

46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1355,"It sounds like you're really interested in finding ways to stop smoking, and I can imagine that's been challenging for you. Quitting smoking is a tough journey, and you've already taken a big step by exploring different options and seeking support. I’d love to understand a bit more about what you've tried in the past and what worked or didn’t work for you. Would you be open to sharing some of those experiences with me?"

46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1359,"So you've tried both patches and pills as ways to quit smoking, but they didn't give you the results you hoped for. That can be really frustrating when you put effort into trying something, and it doesn't pan out the way you'd wanted. What led you to choose those methods to begin with, and how did you feel while you were using them?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1360,mad because i spent a lot of money on them and they didnt help me
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1361,"It sounds like the financial investment and the lack of success with those methods left you feeling quite upset. That's understandable, especially when you're committed to making a change. Despite these setbacks, you're still here, looking for solutions. What keeps you motivated to continue exploring ways to quit smoking?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1362,better health and to be able to breathe better
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1363,Your commitment to better health and breathing are strong motivators for you. Those are important reasons to keep moving forward on this journey. How does the idea of enjoying better health and improved breathing make you feel about the future?
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1364,it makes me feel good
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1365,"Feeling good about the prospect of better health and easier breathing is a powerful feeling. It sounds like these are really meaningful goals for you, and they seem to give you hope for the future. Is there anything else about your life or health that you'd like to be different as a result of quitting smoking?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1366,not other them them 2 things i said
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1367,"Those two goals—better health and easier breathing—are quite significant, and it seems like they're central to why you want to quit smoking. Before we think about possible steps forward, is there anything else you want to discuss or explore about your relationship with smoking?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1368,if there are any good eddective ways to quit
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1369,"We can definitely explore different strategies for quitting that you might find effective. Before we dive into that, I’d like to summarize what we touched upon today: you've had some frustrating experiences with patches and pills, yet you're still motivated by the desire for better health and breathing. May I have your permission to talk about some potential options now, and maybe some new approaches that could work for you?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1370,yes
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1371,"Great, thank you. Some people find that support groups, counseling, or a combination of different methods can be effective. Each person's situation is unique, so it's about finding what's best for you. Would you be interested in talking about any of these options, or is there something specific you had in mind that you want to explore further?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1372,i would but the only problem i have with trying that is lack of time
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1373,"That's understandable; finding the time can be a major hurdle. It sounds like your schedule is pretty packed, which makes it challenging to explore new methods. If you were to consider trying something new, what might be a way that fits into your current life, even with the time constraints you're facing?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1374,weekends are really the only free time i have now
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1375,"Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like weekends provide a bit of breathing room in your schedule. Maybe we can explore options that could fit into those free times, like connecting with a support group that meets on weekends or finding resources you can engage with at your own pace, such as online workshops or apps. How does that sound as a possibility?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1376,that sounds good to me
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1377,"I'm glad to hear that sounds like a good fit for you. It seems like you're open to exploring resources that could work with your schedule. Would you like to look into specific groups or tools together, or would you prefer to research some options on your own and discuss them later?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1378,together
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1379,"Absolutely, we can look into this together. Let's start by exploring some online resources or support groups that offer flexibility and align with your weekend availability. Are there any specific types of tools or support systems that you’re interested in, such as apps, virtual meetings, or something else?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1380,virtual would be great
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1381,"Virtual support can be really convenient, especially with your packed schedule. There are a number of support groups and programs that offer virtual meetings designed to help people quit smoking. Some programs also provide access to online communities or forums where you can connect with others who are on a similar path. We can look into finding a specific program that resonates with you and offers meetings or support sessions on weekends. Does that sound like a good next step?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1382,yes
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1383,"Great! Together, we can search for virtual support groups or programs that hold weekend sessions. Many of these programs also offer resources like guided quit plans, educational materials, and access to coaches or counselors. I can suggest a few options, and we can explore which ones might work best for you. How does that sound as we move forward?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1384,thats sounds good
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1385,"I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's start by identifying a few well-regarded virtual programs or support groups. I recommend looking at resources that offer flexibility and are known for supporting people like you who are motivated to quit smoking for health reasons. Once you have a chance to learn more about these options, you can decide which one feels most aligned with your needs and preferences. How are you feeling about exploring these new possibilities?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1386,im feeling good about that

46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1389,"I'm really glad we're moving in a direction that feels right for you.

46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1391,"Thank you for our conversation today, and for sharing so openly. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You expressed your desire to quit smoking, motivated by better health and improved breathing.

Is there anything specific you'd like to delve into at this point, or perhaps any thoughts or feelings that have come up since we last spoke about your decision to pursue virtual support?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1394,no im going to try and find some apps or virtual meetings and see if they help me
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,counsellor,1395,"That sounds like a solid plan.

We started by discussing your experiences with trying to quit smoking in the past using patches and pills, which left you feeling frustrated.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
46,5d42486206811e001ada5b4b,client,1400,No
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1401,Hello there! Thanks for coming in today. How have you been feeling lately? I'd love to hear how things are going for you.
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1402,`thank am feeling fine
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1403,I'm glad to hear you're feeling fine. It's great that you've taken the time to be here today. Do you mind if we talk a little about your smoking habits and how you're feeling about them lately?
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1404,"""Well, I don’t mind talking about it. I guess my smoking habits are...pretty regular. I usually smoke a few times a day—more when I’m stressed. Lately, I’ve been thinking about cutting back, but it’s"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1405,"You're finding yourself smoking more when stress comes up, and recently, the idea of cutting back has crossed your mind but feels challenging in some way. It sounds like you're kind of in the middle—thinking about change but also aware of obstacles. What has prompted you to start thinking about possibly reducing smoking?"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1406,"Stress makes me smoke more, and recently, I've noticed it affecting my energy and breathing. I want change"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1407,It seems like the impact on your energy and breathing is clear to you. The idea of wanting change is beginning to grow because these physical effects are becoming more noticeable. It's a hard balance sometimes—managing stress on one hand and dealing with these health effects on the other. What are you hoping could be different if you were to cut back on smoking?
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1408,I’m hoping I’ll feel more energetic and breathe easier. Maybe I’ll manage stress better without relying on cigarettes. I just want to feel healthier and more in control of it all
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1409,You're imagining a healthier future where you're full of energy and find new ways to cope with stress without relying on smoking. The desire for better control and feeling healthier stands out to you. What do you think might be your biggest motivator to move toward that vision of feeling more energetic and in control?
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1410,"I think the biggest motivator is my health—feeling better physically, like having more energy and not being out of breath. Plus, being able to handle stress without smoking would make me feel more in"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1411,"Your health is a powerful motivator for you. You really want to feel better, both physically and in terms of managing stress. It's important for you to have more energy and to breathe more easily, which would contribute to feeling more in control of your life. Is there anything else you'd like to explore about what this change could mean for you?"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1412,"I think it could also mean a shift in how I see myself—more confident, maybe. If I could manage without smoking, it might show me that I’m stronger than I thought. I’d feel proud"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1413,"It seems that this change could have a meaningful impact on how you perceive yourself. Managing without smoking could bring a new sense of confidence, revealing strength and independence that you'd be proud of. It's wonderful to hear your thoughts on how this could affect your self-image. Would you like to talk more about these potential changes in self-perception or anything else on your mind before we consider exploring the steps to get there?"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1414,"I’d like to talk more about how I might handle those moments when stress hits, without relying on smoking. I think that's the real challenge. I'd need something else to fall back on"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1415,Handling stress without cigarettes is indeed a significant part of the journey you're thinking about. Exploring alternative ways to cope with stress can be a valuable step. What are some things you've considered or done in the past that might help you relieve stress without turning to smoking?
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,client,1416,"I've tried deep breathing exercises before, and sometimes I go for a walk. But when stress hits hard, it's hard to stick with them. I guess I could try them more often"
47,663945510818036ee5453ff7,counsellor,1417,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and taking the time to explore these important aspects of your life with me. Our conversation today has been really valuable, and I want to make sure we capture everything we've talked about.

You've mentioned smoking regularly and how stress tends to increase your habit. You're starting to feel the physical effects like decreased energy and more difficulty breathing, which is prompting you to consider cutting back. It's clear that your health is a big motivator, alongside the desire to manage stress in a healthier way.

You're hoping for a future where you feel more energetic, breathe easier, and handle stress with new strategies— with an added benefit of boosting your confidence and sense of control. We've talked about the idea of deep breathing exercises and taking walks as potential stress-relief activities, acknowledging that they can be difficult to maintain during stressful moments.

As we finish today, you’re reflecting on how to incorporate these strategies more consistently, which is a great starting point. I really appreciate your openness and willingness to engage in this conversation. Whenever you're ready to explore this further or discuss new strategies, I'm here to support you."
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1418,Hello there! I'm glad to have you here for our session today. How are you feeling as we get started?
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1419,I'm a bit nervous
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1420,"That's completely understandable, and I'm here to support you as we talk through anything that's on your mind. There's no pressure, and we can take things at your own pace. Is there anything in particular you'd like to start with?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1421,Sure. How does a constant smoker just quit?
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1422,It's a great question and a big step to even think about it. Many people who smoke have mixed feelings about quitting. It often starts with exploring those feelings—what you enjoy about smoking and what you might be concerned about. What's your experience like when you think about stopping smoking?
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1423,I just don't know if I can completely quit you know. I researched and saw that the nicotine is addictive
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1424,"It sounds like you're wrestling with the idea of quitting and feeling unsure because of how addictive nicotine can be. Many people feel this way. On one hand, the idea of quitting might feel daunting because of that addiction, and on the other, there might be reasons you're considering stopping. What's pushing you to think about quitting right now?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1425,for health reasons majorly
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1426,"You're motivated by health concerns, which is an important reason. It seems like you’re aware of the impact smoking might have on your well-being, yet quitting still feels overwhelming. What specific health concerns are on your mind when you think about smoking?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1427,"I have heard what smoking can do to the lungs. I already have diabetes, I don't think I can add lung issues to it."
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1428,"You're concerned about the potential risks smoking poses to your lungs, especially since you're already managing diabetes. Taking care of your health is clearly important to you, and you're thinking about the added burden smoking might place on your body. How do you feel knowing that quitting could positively impact your overall health and well-being?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1429,I am highly anticipative about that.
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1430,"You're feeling hopeful about the positive impact quitting could have on your health. That's an important feeling to hold onto when considering change. What else do you think would change for you, aside from your health, if you decided to stop smoking?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1431,"well, I guess I can say the money for buying the plethora of cigarettes could be used for something more profitable"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1432,"You're seeing a potential financial benefit, which is great. Redirecting what you spend on cigarettes to something more beneficial could lead to tangible improvements in your life. With health and financial benefits in mind, what keeps you hesitating or feeling uncertain about making a change right now?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1433,I just don't believe in myself enough that I can quit. I have tried quitting several times.
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1434,"You've faced challenges in quitting before, and that's left you feeling doubtful about your ability to quit. It's understandable after several attempts. This journey can be tough, and it can feel discouraging at times. What have you learned from those previous attempts that could inform your approach if you decide to try again?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1435,I realized being around people who smoke contributed to me not being able to quit
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1436,You've noticed that being around others who smoke has been a significant barrier in your efforts to quit. That awareness is incredibly valuable. How do you think addressing this influence could support you if you decide to try quitting again?
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1437,"When I am alone, I don't think I will really crave to smoke continuously. I usually smoke a lot when I am  in the midst of people"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1438,"Being alone seems to lessen the urge to smoke, and social settings seem to increase it. It looks like modifying your environment and the people around you could play a crucial role in your journey towards quitting. With this insight, what are your thoughts on taking small steps towards creating a space conducive to quitting?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1439,Yeah hopefully taking small steps help
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1440,Taking small steps can definitely make the process feel more manageable and less overwhelming. Smaller steps can also build up to bigger successes over time. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about before we explore what these small steps might look like for you?
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1441,let's go right into that
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1442,"Great! So, from our conversation today, it seems like addressing your environment and the company you keep might be key areas to focus on. Perhaps starting with finding moments in your day where you can be in a smoke-free environment could be a helpful first step. How does that sound to you, and are there specific ideas you already have in mind for these small changes?"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,client,1443,"I would maybe have to excuse myself when I am around people who smoke, to take the urge off"
48,66f99b8e907d2350127aa0ae,counsellor,1444,"Thank you for your time today. We've covered a lot in our conversation, and as we wrap up, I want to summarize what we've explored together.

You've shared your concerns about smoking, especially regarding its impact on your health while managing diabetes. The possibility of lung issues is weighing on your mind, and you're also thinking about how quitting could free up financial resources. You've reflected on the influence of social settings on your smoking habits and realized that being around people who smoke contributes to the difficulty of quitting. You also see the value in surrounding yourself with environments that support your goal to quit.

Despite trying several times before, you've gained insights into how your environment affects you and expressed hope in taking small steps. You're considering practical ways to create smoke-free spaces, like excusing yourself from situations where people are smoking.

I appreciate your openness today and your willingness to explore these different aspects. If you'd like to continue our conversation or revisit these ideas in the future, I'm here to support you. Take care as you reflect on these steps, and feel free to reach out whenever you're ready for more support."
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1445,Hello there! It's great to meet you today. How have you been feeling lately?
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1446,I have been feeling okay but a little stressed
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1447,I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like stress is something you're dealing with right now. Stress can definitely have a big impact on our lives. Would you like to talk more about what's been causing stress for you lately?
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1448,My partner is an alcoholic and drinking alot
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1449,"That sounds really challenging and probably quite overwhelming at times. Having someone close to you dealing with alcohol issues can be very stressful. How has it been affecting you, and is there anything specific you've been doing to manage this stress?"
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1450,It has just been making me sad i make her food and she wont eat it
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1451,"I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you're putting a lot of care and effort into supporting her, and it's tough when things don't improve. Your feelings of sadness are understandable. How have you been coping with these emotions, and do you find that smoking plays any role in managing this situation for you?"
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1452,I have had my daughter for support and smoking helps me to calm down abit
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1453,It's great to hear that you have your daughter for support. Having someone to lean on can make a big difference. Smoking seems to be providing you with some relief from the stress and emotions you're experiencing. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in your life overall?
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1454,I feel like it is okay i will only smoke around 5 a day
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1455,"You seem to have a sense of control over your smoking, which might be providing you some comfort through difficult times. Five a day seems moderate, though I wonder if there are things you like about smoking and things you might not like as much. Would you be open to exploring both sides of that with me?"
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1456,I like that it is a destresser but i hate how it makes me smell and my breathe
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1457,"On one hand, smoking helps you manage stress, which is really important to you. On the other hand, there's the downside of the smell and its effect on your breath, which might not be pleasant. It sounds like you're weighing the benefits and the downsides. How do these feelings influence how you think about smoking in your life moving forward?"
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1458,I think i will carry on i have cancer so will only live a few more years anyway
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1459,"I'm deeply saddened to hear about your cancer diagnosis. It's understandable that such a profound situation might influence how you view smoking and other aspects of life. Your health and well-being are important, and I'm here to support you in any way that feels right for you. Given everything you've shared, how do you feel about the ways you're prioritizing your comfort and care right now?"
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,client,1460,I feel good about this having a cigarette and cup of tea makes me happy
49,6615283f82799fd70e2c056b,counsellor,1461,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's go over what we've talked about. You've been experiencing stress, partly due to your partner's struggles with alcohol, which is understandably difficult and has been making you feel sad. Throughout this, you've found support from your daughter and comfort from smoking and a cup of tea, which make you feel good. Smoking seems to serve as a way to de-stress, although you're aware of the downsides like the smell. You’ve mentioned that given your cancer diagnosis, the importance of comfort and happiness may guide your choices moving forward. Whatever path you decide on, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1464,stress with work and kids
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1465,That sounds like a lot to juggle at once. Balancing work and kids can be really challenging and stressful. How have you been managing all of that?
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1466,smoking breaks
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1467,"It sounds like those smoking breaks are offering you a moment to step back, breathe, and collect your thoughts amid the stress. How do you feel about your smoking right now in the context of everything you've been dealing with?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1468,its a relief but i need to quit
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1469,"You're finding that smoking offers some immediate relief from stress, but at the same time, there's a desire to quit. What are the most significant reasons driving your wish to stop smoking?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1470,health and finances
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1471,Both your health and finances are really important factors. Investing in your well-being and saving money could greatly benefit your future. What changes do you imagine might happen in your life if you were to quit smoking?
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1472,i could get fitter and save some money
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1473,Getting fitter and saving money sound like significant and positive changes. Those benefits could have a great impact on your overall lifestyle. What do you think would be the most rewarding part of achieving those changes?
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1474,treating my kids more
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1475,Being able to treat your kids more seems like a very rewarding goal. It really highlights how important family is to you. How does the idea of providing more for your kids influence your thoughts about quitting smoking?
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1476,its a motivstion
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1477,"Focusing on your kids gives you a strong motivation to consider making this change. With everything we've talked about—the stress you're dealing with, the relief smoking provides, and your desire for better health and stability—how are you feeling about where you are right now in your journey to quit smoking? Are there any other thoughts or feelings you’d like to explore before we discuss any next steps?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1478,i really want to quit but at the same time i really love it so its hard
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1479,"You find yourself torn between the comfort and relief smoking provides and the strong desire to quit to benefit your health and family. It's understandable to feel that way, given what smoking means to you right now. Let's take a moment to acknowledge the challenge and complexity of these feelings. Is there anything else you want to explore or share about your experience?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1480,i wish it was easier to quit
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1481,"Wishing it were easier to quit suggests you're really engaged in the idea of making a change, even with the mixed feelings. Would it be okay if we explored some options and ideas that could make the process feel more manageable for you?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1482,yes please
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1483,"Great, thank you for being open to it. We've talked about some key motivations and challenges today, which is a great start. Before diving into planning, let me summarize what we've covered: You're managing a lot of stress with work and kids and use smoking as a momentary relief, but you're concerned about your health and financial savings, which makes quitting appealing. You're motivated by wanting to treat your kids more. Your feelings are mixed because you still find comfort in smoking.

If you're ready, we can explore some steps that might help make quitting feel a bit more within reach. How does that sound to you?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1484,yes please
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1485,"Let's start by considering some small, manageable steps. You might try setting specific times during the day to take breaks without smoking, or finding an activity that can give you similar relief, like brief breathing exercises or a quick walk. What are your thoughts on starting with a small change like that?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1486,yes it sounds good
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1487,It's great to hear that you're open to trying a small change. It can be a valuable way to test out what feels right for you. You can experiment with different activities during your usual smoking breaks to see what brings you the same sense of relief. How about we touch base next time on how that experience went for you? We can keep building on what's working and adjust if needed. How does that sound?
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1488,okay that sounds good
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1489,"That's wonderful to hear! You've taken a big step today by exploring your thoughts and being open to trying something new. I'm here to support you on this journey, and we can continue to build on this foundation together. Feel free to reach out if you have any thoughts or questions before our next session. Take care, and I'll look forward to hearing how things go for you."
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1490,thankyou
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,counsellor,1491,"Thank you for this conversation and for sharing your thoughts and feelings. To summarize what we discussed today, we talked about how you're managing the stress of work and kids and how smoking has been providing a momentary relief. You've shared your desire to quit for health and financial reasons, motivated by the idea of being able to treat your kids more. Despite feeling torn between the comfort smoking brings and your reasons to quit, you're open to starting with small steps, like finding alternative activities during your breaks. I'm here to support you on this journey, and I'm looking forward to hearing how these changes feel for you in our next session. Take care until then.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
50,59edca95ac0af70001b36f9c,client,1492,No
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1493,"Hello there! How are you doing today? I'm really glad you decided to join this session. It's great that we can have this time to chat together. 

I hope you're feeling comfortable. Is there anything particular on your mind today that you'd like to talk about?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1494,Quitting smoking
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1495,Thanks for sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been considering quitting smoking. How does that feel for you right now?
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1496,"It feels like something that I should do, however I have not taken steps towards quitting."
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1497,"It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of quitting, but maybe haven't found the right moment or motivation to take those steps yet. What's brought you to the point of thinking about quitting? What's important to you about it?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1498,Extending lifespan
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1499,That's a really meaningful reason. Wanting to extend your lifespan shows you have a goal of taking good care of yourself and ensuring more time for the things and people who matter to you. What else comes to mind when you think about quitting smoking?
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1500,That's about it
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1501,Extending your lifespan is certainly a significant motivation on its own. It sounds like your health and future are important to you. Do you find yourself thinking about how smoking affects your life or future in other ways?
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1502,Not really
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1503,Got it. Focusing on extending your lifespan is a strong guiding reason. It seems like health is a significant part of your thoughts around quitting. What are your thoughts on some of the challenges or things that make quitting smoking difficult for you right now?
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1504,external stressors
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1505,Stress can certainly pose a challenge when it comes to quitting smoking. Many people find it difficult to manage stress without turning to their usual habits. It sounds like you're balancing quite a bit. What kind of stressors are most pressing for you?
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1506,I do not want to discuss that
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1507,"That's completely okay. We can focus on whatever you're comfortable with discussing. It's clear that these stressors have an impact, so respecting your space is important. Are there particular moments or situations where you feel the urge to smoke more strongly?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1508,usually when focusing on a task
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1509,That makes sense. It seems like smoking has become a way for you to manage focus during tasks. Many people experience a temporary sense of relief or concentration when they smoke. What do you think it is about smoking that helps in those moments for you?
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1510,Nothing
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1511,"It sounds like, on some level, smoking isn't truly providing the help it once might have. Despite not feeling it helps with focus, you've been reaching for cigarettes in those moments. How are you feeling about the idea of finding different ways to manage your focus and stress, ones that might align more with your goal of quitting?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1512,depends on the options
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1513,"That makes a lot of sense, and it's important to find options that feel right for you. Would you like to explore some alternatives that might help with focus and stress, or is there anything specific you have in mind that you'd like to try?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1514,I have nothing in mind
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1515,"That's perfectly okay. It can be challenging to think of alternatives when smoking has been a go-to. Before we explore potential options together, is there anything else you want to chat about regarding your journey of thinking about quitting or the role smoking plays in your life?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1516,no
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1517,"Alright, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me so far. To recap, we've talked about your interest in quitting smoking to extend your lifespan, how stress factors in, and how cigarettes have been linked to focusing on tasks, despite not truly helping. 

Would you be open to exploring some steps or options that could support you in this journey toward quitting?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1518,yes
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1519,"Great! We can look at a few different approaches and see what feels like a good fit for you. Some people find relaxation techniques or mindfulness helpful for managing stress, while others explore physical activities or hobbies to redirect their focus. There are also various resources and support groups available. As we explore these, it'll be important for you to pick what feels most comfortable and achievable. 

Would you like to look into any of these options, or do any other ideas come to mind that you'd like to start with?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1520,"Those options will not work, I smoke when i am working."
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1521,"It sounds like smoking has become intertwined with your work routine. Transitioning away from that can be quite a challenge. Maybe we could consider options that fit into your work environment or routine. For instance, some people keep their hands busy with a stress ball, or they take brief breaks to step away and reset their mind. Others find it helpful to have a drink of water or a quick stretch. What do you think might be manageable during your workday?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1522,I can not leave my desk.  stress ball might work
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1523,It sounds like a stress ball could be a practical option to try at your desk. It provides something to engage with and can be a simple way to channel that urge to smoke. How do you feel about giving that a try or incorporating it into your routine?
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1524,I can try
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1525,"That's a positive step! Trying a stress ball might offer a new way to manage the urge without disrupting your work. It's all about finding small changes that can lead toward your bigger goal of quitting smoking. 

Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any support you might need moving forward?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1526,no
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,counsellor,1527,"Thank you for the conversation today. Let's go over what we discussed. You mentioned that quitting smoking to extend your lifespan is important to you, though the external stressors make it challenging to take that step. Smoking seems to be part of your work routine, and you expressed that it doesn't really help with focus. Together, we explored that a stress ball could be a practical tool to try at your desk. Making small changes like this can gradually support your goal of quitting smoking. If you ever want to delve deeper or explore more options, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
51,66366e14353aa2391aeddbd8,client,1528,No
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1529,Hi there! It's great to meet you today. I hope you're doing well. Let's start by having a friendly chat. How has your day been so far?
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1530,its been ok just a little poorly with a blocked gland in my neck
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1531,I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling under the weather with a blocked gland. That can be really uncomfortable. How are you managing with it?
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1532,just pain killers and heat
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1533,"It's good that you're taking steps to ease the discomfort. Coping with pain can be tough. If you'd like to talk about anything else that's on your mind or something specific you're dealing with, feel free to share. I'm here for you."
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1534,it has got me thinking tho that its time to stop smoking as this blocked gland can be blocked due to smoking
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1535,It's understandable that having this experience can make you reflect on smoking. There's a connection you're considering between your health and smoking. What are your thoughts or feelings about the idea of stopping smoking?
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1536,scares me thinking about stopping smoking as ive smoked for over 25 years ive tried a few times to stop but its so hard to quit
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1537,"It makes complete sense that the idea of stopping smoking after 25 years feels daunting. It's been a long-standing part of your life, and trying to quit is known to be challenging. Maybe you could share some of your past experiences with trying to quit–what worked, what didn’t, and how you felt during those times?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1538,the last time i tried was about 3 years ago i used the patches and the gum see i tend to have a lot of stresses in my life so smoking is like an escapism
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1539,"It sounds like the last time you tried to quit, you were exploring different supports like patches and gum, but stress played a big role in your experience. Smoking has been a way for you to escape from those stresses. What kinds of stress do you find most challenging, and how do you feel smoking helps with that?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1540,when things go wrong or dont go the way you want them to i find smoking a way of not dealing with stuff like that at the time its like you have a cigarette and the stress slips away for a moment or so
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1541,"It sounds like smoking offers you a temporary break from the stress, almost like a pause button that helps you escape from challenges when things aren't going as planned. Having that momentary relief can feel comforting, even if it's for a short time. What do you think might change in your life or how you handle stress if smoking were no longer part of the equation?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1542,need to look at how to handle the stresses in the first place and implement the techniques to deal with the stress etc
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1543,"It's insightful that you're recognizing the need to develop new strategies for dealing with stress. Finding ways to manage stress differently could lead to meaningful changes if you decide to move away from smoking. What kind of techniques do you think would be helpful for you to explore, or are there any you're curious about trying?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1544,im not to sure what is out there to try would love to try new techniques tho
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1545,"It's great to hear that you're open to exploring new techniques for managing stress. There are several options out there, like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or even physical activities that might help in handling stress differently. Would you like to discuss anything else at this point before we explore what might be helpful for you?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1546,no i think that is all thank you
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1547,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's go over what we've talked about. You've been dealing with a blocked gland and are managing it with painkillers and heat. This experience made you reflect on smoking and your desire to stop, despite feeling scared because smoking has been a part of your life for over 25 years. You talked about how smoking has been a way to escape stress temporarily, particularly when things don't go as planned. You've also identified the need to develop new ways to manage stress and expressed interest in exploring new techniques. It's been really nice to understand what you're experiencing and thinking about. Thank you again for sharing.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1548,"Yes, let's continue."
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1549,"Great! Since you've mentioned an interest in exploring new techniques, maybe we could look at some options together. Would it be okay if we talked about potential ideas for managing stress that don't involve smoking?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1550,yes
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1551,"Awesome! Let's explore some possibilities. There are many different techniques that people find helpful. You might consider stress-relief methods, like deep breathing exercises or meditation, that can help calm your mind. Physical activities, like going for a walk or light exercise, can also be effective for managing stress. Some people find journaling to be a useful way to process thoughts and feelings. 

Are there any techniques from these options that you feel particularly drawn to, or would you like to discuss more?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1552,meditation sounds good
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1553,"Meditation can be a wonderful tool for easing stress and finding a sense of calm. It allows you to take a few moments to be present and can really help clear the mind. If you're interested, there are many guided meditation resources available, including apps, videos, or classes, that can help you get started. How do you feel about trying out some meditation as a new way to handle stress?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1554,sounds good defo something i would try
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1555,"That's fantastic to hear! Trying meditation could be a helpful step in managing stress and might offer you some of that peace you seek without reaching for a cigarette. It sounds like you're considering a new path that aligns with your thoughts about change. Is there anything else you'd like to consider or explore, or do you feel ready to start planning how you might incorporate meditation into your routine?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1556,what tablets can you take to help stop smoking
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1557,"There are a few medications that people often use to help with quitting smoking. This includes options like nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in various forms, and there are prescription medications like varenicline or bupropion. These can help manage cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms, but they should be used under the guidance of a healthcare provider, who can help determine the best option for you based on your individual needs and health. 

Would it be helpful to discuss how to reach out to your healthcare provider about these options, or would you like to learn more about how they work?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1558,how do they work ?
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1559,"Of course! Here's a brief overview of how they work:

1. **Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)**: NRT provides you with a lower, controlled dose of nicotine to help reduce withdrawal symptoms while you're quitting smoking. It's available in various forms like patches, gums, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays. The idea is to gradually reduce your nicotine dependence.

2. **Varenicline (Chantix)**: This medication works by affecting nicotine receptors in the brain. It helps alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduces the pleasure you get from smoking, making it less appealing. 

3. **Bupropion (Zyban)**: An antidepressant that also helps reduce cravings and withdrawal effects. It’s believed to work on neurotransmitters in the brain that are involved in addiction and mood regulation.

Each of these options has its own benefits and possible side effects. Would consulting a healthcare provider for a personalized recommendation be a step you'd be interested in taking?"
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,client,1560,Bupropion (Zyban) is this just used for stopping smoking or can it be used for other addictions can u tell me more information on this drug
52,6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,counsellor,1561,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. We've covered some important ground, and I truly appreciate your openness. Let's go over what we've discussed so far. You've given some thought to quitting smoking, especially after dealing with a blocked gland. You talked about smoking as a way to temporarily escape from stress and acknowledged how challenging it has been to quit after 25 years. You expressed an interest in finding new tools to handle stress, and meditation stood out as a technique you'd like to try. We also discussed Bupropion (Zyban) as a potential option to help with quitting smoking. It's an antidepressant that can also aid in reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and you expressed curiosity about how it works.

If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out anytime. Your journey is important, and taking these steps toward change is commendable. Thank you again for sharing, and I wish you the best as you explore new ways to manage stress and potentially move away from smoking."

54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1584,"That's a thoughtful question, and it's great that you're considering what might help make the process easier for you. Before we dive into that, I'd love to hear a bit about your experience with smoking. What's it been like for you so far?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1585,"as an anxious person, smoking has helped me calm my nerves but the constant use of cigarettes over the years has considerably declined my overall health"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1586,"It's understandable that smoking has been a way for you to manage your anxiety. At the same time, it's concerning to hear that it's taken a toll on your health. It seems like there's a lot at play here—some benefits you've seen from smoking, but also some serious downsides. Could you tell me more about how these aspects are affecting your day-to-day life?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1587,i get headaches and joint pains here and there
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1588,Those physical symptoms sound really uncomfortable and challenging to deal with. It must be frustrating to experience those headaches and joint pains. How are these issues influencing your motivation to make a change with your smoking?
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1589,headaches hinder my ability to be efficient in my work and joint pains prove to be a nuisance in the gym
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1590,"It sounds like these health issues are getting in the way of things that are important to you, like your work and staying fit. The impact on your efficiency at work and your time in the gym seems significant. How do you feel about the possibility of regaining some of that efficiency and comfort if you were to make a change?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1591,i am eager for that
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1592,That eagerness is such a powerful feeling and it's great to hear. It shows a strong sense of determination to regain those parts of your life.

54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1594,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns with me today. Let's go over what we've discussed so far. You've shared that smoking has played a role in calming your nerves, especially with your anxiety. However, it's concerning how smoking has impacted your overall health, leading to headaches and joint pains. These symptoms are not only uncomfortable but have also disrupted important activities in your life like work and going to the gym. It's clear that these challenges have motivated you to seek the possibility of change. I'm glad we were able to explore how quitting smoking could improve your daily life and well-being. If you're ready, we can start thinking about steps forward when the time feels right for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1596,"Great! I'm glad you're open to exploring this further. With your motivation to regain ease and efficiency in mind, what do you think might be the first small step that feels doable for you toward reducing or quitting smoking?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1597,getting an alternative since i cant go cold turkey
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1598,"Finding an alternative sounds like a practical and thoughtful approach, especially considering your experience with anxiety. What kind of alternatives have you thought about, or would you like to explore?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1599,coffee or nicotine patches
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1600,"Those are both interesting alternatives to consider. Coffee might offer a ritual similar to smoking, while nicotine patches can ease withdrawal symptoms by providing a steady, controlled dose of nicotine. Which one feels like it might fit best into your lifestyle?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1601,both
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1602,It's great that you're open to trying both options. Combining them might offer a balance between finding a new routine with coffee and managing nicotine cravings with patches. How do you envision incorporating these into your daily routine to help support your goal?
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1603,morning coffees in place of morning smoking and a nicotine patch somewhere during the day
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1604,"That sounds like a thoughtful plan to start with. Replacing your morning smoke with coffee brings a new habit to look forward to, and using a nicotine patch during the day can help manage cravings better. How do you feel about giving this approach a try and seeing how it works for you?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1605,eager
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1606,"Your eagerness to try this new approach is really encouraging and shows your commitment to making a positive change. It's a step that aligns so well with your goals. As you embark on this journey, remember you don't have to tackle everything at once—small steps can lead to great progress. How might you remind yourself of this commitment on days when it feels challenging?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1607,think about the downsides of my cigarette abuse
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1608,"Reflecting on the downsides might serve as a powerful motivator during tougher times. Reminding yourself of how those headaches and joint pains have affected your life can reinforce why you're making this change. Is there any support you might find helpful as you begin this journey, whether from friends, family, or resources?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1609,tell the people close to me about my attempts in order for them to keep cigarettes away from me
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1610,"Involving those close to you sounds like a strong plan. Their support can create an environment where it's easier to stay focused on your goals, and having them understand your commitment can help keep cigarettes out of reach. How do you think they will respond to your decision to make this change?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1611,they will be happy and supportive
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1612,"It's wonderful to know that you have a supportive circle who will be pleased with your decision and can offer encouragement along the way. Their understanding and assistance can really make a difference on your journey. As you prepare to implement this new plan, is there anything else you'd like to consider or discuss that might help you on this path?"
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,client,1613,no
54,66acbaf5c803ca1a1ef3f056,counsellor,1614,"Thank you for sharing so openly and thoughtfully today. You've made some valuable reflections and created a plan that's aligned with your goals and strengths. Remember that this journey is personal, and it's okay to adjust your approach as needed. If you ever want to talk more or explore other aspects, I'm here to support you. Wishing you the best as you take these steps—I'm confident you can do it. Feel free to reach out anytime. Take care!"

55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1622,That's perfectly fine. We can take things slow and just chat about anything that's on your mind. How have things been going with smoking lately?
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,client,1623,fine
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1624,"Got it. Does smoking feel like an important part of your life right now, or is it something you're thinking about changing?"
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,client,1625,important
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1626,I understand that smoking holds a certain value for you at the moment. People often have different reasons for why it feels important. What's it giving you that you find valuable?
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,client,1627,stress relief
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1628,It sounds like smoking offers you some relief when things get stressful. Many people find comfort in routines that help them manage stress. What are some of the situations or moments where you turn to smoking for that relief?
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,client,1629,stress
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1630,Stressful moments seem to trigger that need for relief. It's understandable to seek ways to manage those difficult times. How do you feel about this way of coping with stress? Are there parts of it you find helpful or maybe not so helpful?
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,client,1631,helpful
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1632,"Smoking does help you manage stress in a helpful way right now. It's important to have ways to cope with difficult times. Have you ever thought about other ways to manage stress, or is smoking the main approach you've relied on?"
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,client,1633,smoking
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1634,"It's clear that smoking has been your go-to method for managing stress. It's great that you're exploring this in our conversation. People sometimes find it helpful to think about both the benefits and challenges of their routines. Are there any challenges or concerns you've noticed with smoking, or is it mostly positive for you?"
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,client,1635,content
55,5ea443b82d77062697ac9814,counsellor,1636,"It seems like smoking has been a steady part of your routine, giving you a level of contentment in dealing with stress. You're in a space where you're comfortable with it right now. However, if there's ever anything you'd like to explore or discuss about your relationship with smoking, I'm here to support you.

56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1640,Hi there! It's great to see you today. How have you been doing lately? Feel free to share whatever's on your mind.
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1641,"Yeah,,i'm good"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1642,I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any topic on your mind today?
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1643,Smoking I guess
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1644,"Sure, we can definitely talk about smoking. What's been going on with that for you lately?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1645,wanting to quit but dont
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1646,It sounds like you're feeling torn between wanting to quit smoking and not quite feeling ready to make that change. What do you think is keeping you in both of those places?
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1647,"I like smoking, though its bad for me"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1648,"You enjoy smoking and some aspects of it are appealing for you, yet you're also aware of its negative effects on your health. What are some of the things you like most about smoking? And on the flip side, what concerns you about its impact on your health?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1649,"just habit , a bad one"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1650,"It sounds like smoking has become a routine part of your life, even though you recognize it as a habit you consider harmful. How does smoking fit into your daily routine, and what do you experience when you think about possibly changing that habit?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1651,"Concerns, health reasons"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1652,"Your health seems to be a big part of what's got you thinking about this habit. How does your smoking make you feel in terms of your health, and what changes would you hope for if you decided to make adjustments to your smoking habit?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1653,"You stop smoking, you eat more, to fill the void"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1654,You're thinking about how quitting might lead to eating more to compensate for the absence of smoking. It's like you're weighing one concern against another. What are your thoughts on how you might manage this potential challenge if you decided to make changes to your smoking habits?
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1655,"I'm swapping one bad thing for another , I'd over eat .."
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1656,It sounds like you're concerned about trading one habit for another and turning to overeating could bring its own set of challenges. How do you imagine you could prepare or find strategies to help address this concern if you chose to move forward with changing your smoking habit?
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1657,"don't know how I'd manage it, I'd try, tell my self no .. But give in to temptation"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1658,"You're feeling unsure about managing the urge to substitute smoking with overeating, even though you'd really like to try. It's like there's a struggle between your desire to resist and the temptation itself. What do you believe might help strengthen your resolve, or are there any past experiences where you've managed a similar temptation successfully?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1659,"I've stopped innthe past, for years , then slipped back into it, what do you suggest?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1660,"You've managed to quit before, which shows real strength and determination, even if you've found yourself back in the habit. You've done it once, which means you have strategies that worked before. Would you like to explore those past successes to see what might be useful this time around? If you're open to discussing some options, I'd be glad to help brainstorm ideas with you."
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1661,"Generally, when I've stopped it's been through illness, cold, flu, you dont smoke for days, as youre blocked up, so continue stopping"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1662,"You've found that illness sometimes gives you an unexpected start to quitting, and you've been able to continue not smoking once you begin. So, really, you’ve experienced the ability to go without cigarettes and maintain it for some time. What do you think might help you intentionally tap into that ability to stop, even when you're feeling well?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1663,"Slow down, cut down, phase them out, vaping perhaps"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1664,"Those are some thoughtful ideas—slowing down, cutting back gradually, phasing out, and maybe considering vaping as a transition. It sounds like you're considering multiple ways to approach change gradually and intentionally. Is there one of these ideas that feels more doable or appealing to you at the moment? Or would you like to explore more about how you might implement one of these strategies?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1665,"Cutting back, releasing the routine, one day at a time , the costs are ridiculous, vaping is a tenth of the price"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1666,"Cutting back and breaking the routine one day at a time sounds like a realistic and strategic approach, especially when considering the financial aspect. The cost, it seems, is quite motivating for you. How do you envision starting the process of cutting back, and how might vaping fit into that plan?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1667,"First smoke of the day, don't have it, Once you start, you want more, so prolonging the first smoke longer n longer"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1668,"That sounds like a thoughtful way to gradually reduce your smoking—by delaying that first cigarette as much as possible. By doing this, you're giving yourself more control over craving patterns throughout the day. What do you feel would support or encourage you in extending those periods of not smoking each day?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1669,"Stay busy , do something else with your hands"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1670,Keeping yourself busy and finding things to do with your hands sounds like a smart way to distract yourself and manage those moments when you feel the urge. It seems like having activities or alternatives available could be key in helping you move forward with cutting back. Are there specific activities or strategies that you think could help fill those moments and keep you engaged?
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1671,"Go for a walk, leave the smokes at home, go do chores,"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1672,"Going for a walk and leaving the cigarettes at home—or engaging in chores—are positive and proactive strategies. These actions not only occupy your hands but also create distance from the habit. It feels like you have a good sense of what alternatives work for you. Is there anything else you'd like to explore in terms of cutting back, or any support you think would be helpful as you try out these steps?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1673,"In think thats it , what do you suggest?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1674,"You've given a lot of thought to how you might cut back and manage cravings, including some strategies that have worked for you before. If you feel ready, we could talk about creating a simple plan to try out these ideas, seeing what works best for you, and making adjustments as needed. Would you like to go in that direction and see how you can put these thoughts into action?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1675,Tell me these plans ?
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1676,"Before we dive into planning, is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any other aspects we haven't touched on yet? If you're ready, we can summarize what we've discussed and then explore next steps together. Let me know how you'd like to proceed."
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1677,"Summarize for me, a plan?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1678,"Absolutely. Here's what we've talked about so far:

1. **Awareness**: You're recognizing the ambivalence with smoking—enjoying the routine but being concerned about health and costs.
   
2. **Past Success**: You've successfully quit smoking in the past when illness provided a jumping-off point.

3. **Gradual Change**: You've considered cutting back gradually by delaying your first cigarette of the day and prolonging smoke-free periods.

4. **Supportive Strategies**: You're thinking of staying busy, walking, doing chores, and finding things to do with your hands to manage cravings and routines.

5. **Consideration of Alternatives**: You mentioned vaping as an option to consider for reducing costs and gradually transitioning away from smoking.

Would you like to start building a more detailed plan using these ideas? We can focus on what a typical day might look like using some of these strategies, or set specific goals for how you want to approach this change. How does that sound?"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,client,1679,"I think the plan, is already there, in the above steps"
56,58954e2dc88c680001dd4b7e,counsellor,1680,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. Our conversation has been really insightful, and I appreciate your openness. As we wrap up, let's summarize where we are:

You've expressed your ambivalence about smoking, knowing that it both fits into your routine and raises health and cost concerns. You've drawn on your past experiences of quitting, as you've succeeded before when motivated by health. This time, you're considering gradually cutting back by delaying your first cigarette each day and filling that space with activities like walking or chores to distract and occupy yourself.

Additionally, you've thought about vaping as a more cost-effective alternative while you work towards change. These ideas have formed your plan—one rooted in mindful reduction and resourcefulness.

Remember, it's a process, and being aware of your strengths and potential challenges is a great starting point. If you ever feel like revisiting these strategies or exploring new ideas, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you again, and I wish you all the best with the steps you're setting for yourself. Take care!"

57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1682,Hi there! I'm glad you're here today. How's your day going so far?
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1683,Pretty good- I have had no problems.
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1684,"That's great to hear. It sounds like you're coming into this session with things going smoothly today. I know we're here to talk about smoking, so I'm curious—how do you feel about smoking in your life right now?"
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1685,"I am concerned. I have smoked cigarettes for years, but recently have noticed a constant sore throat, and I am much more worried about lung cancer. Also, the house smells of tobacco."
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1686,"It sounds like there are some real concerns that have been on your mind, like the sore throat and the worry about lung cancer, as well as the smell of tobacco in your home. These things seem to be weighing on you. What has it been like to experience these worries?"
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1687,"Irritating and concerning. However, I am determined to do something about it- to cut down on my smoking and then to give up. I am in the process of reduction."
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1688,"You've got a strong determination to make a change, and you've already started taking steps by cutting down. That shows a lot of commitment. How has this process been for you so far? Are there any challenges you're facing as you make these changes?"
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1689,"It has not been easy and it requires a lot of willpower and mental strength. Smoking is addictive and addictions are not easy to overcome. However, I am making progress- that is a good start."
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1690,"You're recognizing the difficulty in breaking an addiction, and yet you're also seeing the progress you're making, which is really encouraging. It takes a lot of courage and effort to do what you're doing. How do you keep yourself motivated and focused on your goal?"
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1691,"I keep thinking of the major health risks- cancer. Also, the effect of passive smoking on those around me- my family. They are encouraging me in my efforts."
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1692,"You're really clear about the big reasons behind your motivation, like protecting your health and the well-being of your family. That connection with your family's encouragement seems to be quite powerful as well. How does their support make a difference for you in this process?"
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1693,"It is positive as it is supportive- any support for an action is always good, and helps me towards my goal."
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1694,Having that support seems to be a really helpful part of this journey for you. It strengthens your resolve and makes the goal feel more attainable. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about regarding your smoking or the changes you're making?
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1695,Yes- I have tried vaping but that did not work- it did not reduce my consumption. I have thought about nicotine pouches and help and advice from my local pharmacy.
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1696,You've explored vaping as an option but found that it didn't lead to the reduction you were hoping for. You're considering other options like nicotine pouches and seeking advice from your local pharmacy. It's great that you're open to exploring different avenues to support your goal. Would you like to talk more about these possibilities or any thoughts you have on the next steps?
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1697,I think an appointment with the pharmacy is a good idea- I know they help with smoking cessation and put you in touch with the right help and support.
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1698,You've identified a proactive step in making an appointment with the pharmacy. It's great to see you taking this initiative as you know they can offer the support and connections needed for smoking cessation. Would it be helpful to discuss how you might approach this appointment or anything else related to this plan?
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1699,All I need to do is go and see them. I am known at the pharmacy as it is where I get any medicines I need- and they are professional and friendly.
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1700,"It sounds like you have a good relationship with your pharmacy, and you trust their professionalism and friendliness, which should make reaching out to them feel more comfortable. You've clearly thought through this next step. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today, or any other thoughts or feelings you'd like to share before we wrap up?"
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,client,1701,It has been helpful chatting with you- I am more determined to do something about this- the current position cannot carry on.
57,6053e01a6a8e8516ba7d47a7,counsellor,1702,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. Let's go over what we've talked about. You've expressed concerns about the effects of smoking on your health, like the sore throat and the worry about lung cancer, and the impact on your home's environment.

58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,counsellor,1706,"I'm glad to hear you're doing well. I'm doing just fine, thank you! So, what brings you to our conversation today?"
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,client,1707,To explore my smoking behaviors
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,counsellor,1708,That's a great starting point. It sounds like you're curious about your smoking and might be considering how it fits into your life. Would you like to share a bit about your experience with smoking and how you feel about it?
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,client,1709,I have been smoking for 21 years with a few periods of quitting. I would like to quit smoking and develop healthier habits to manage stress and anxiety.
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,counsellor,1710,"Quitting smoking and managing stress in healthier ways can definitely have a positive impact on your life. It sounds like you've already had some experience with quitting in the past, which shows a lot of determination. What do you think has worked for you in those periods of quitting, and what do you find most challenging about staying smoke-free?"
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,client,1711,Well what helped was pregnancy and just not wanting to smoke. The challenge is being able to find soothing healthy habits.
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,counsellor,1712,"It's wonderful that you found motivation through such important moments in your life, like pregnancy. It seems like finding new, healthy ways to soothe yourself could really make a difference. What are some things you enjoy or activities you might be interested in exploring that could bring you a sense of calm or comfort?"
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,client,1713,possibly reading or meditation
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,counsellor,1714,"Reading and meditation both sound like promising options. They can offer relaxation and a sense of peace, which might help manage stress and anxiety. How do you feel about giving one of these a try, and what might your next steps be if you wanted to explore them further?"
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,client,1715,I would try meditating at night instead of smoking a cigarette before bed. Gradually I may be able to incorporate reading.
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,counsellor,1716,"That's a thoughtful approach, trying meditation as a substitute at night. It can be a soothing way to unwind and prepare for rest. Making gradual changes like this can create a supportive environment for exploring new habits. Is there anything else you want to discuss or explore today around your smoking or stress management?"
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,client,1717,No not that I can think of
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,counsellor,1718,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about. You've been reflecting on your 21-year smoking journey and your interest in quitting to adopt healthier habits for managing stress and anxiety. We explored how significant life events, like pregnancy, have been catalysts for previous quitting periods. We've also discussed possible soothing activities such as meditation at night, and gradually incorporating reading into your routine as alternatives to smoking. If you have more to explore in the future, feel free to reach out.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
58,66510b4939f7b5b6cff2cca4,client,1719,No

59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1723,I need help stopping smoking
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1724,You've taken an important step by expressing that you're looking for support to stop smoking. It sounds like quitting is something you're considering seriously. What has led you to think about making this change?
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1725,My health
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1726,"Your health is clearly important to you, and it's understandable that you want to take care of it. What specific health concerns have been on your mind when it comes to smoking?"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1727,I have been coughing uncontrollably
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1728,"That sounds really difficult to deal with, and it must be concerning to have such a persistent cough. It seems like this is affecting your daily life. How have these coughing episodes impacted you?"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1729,Terribly
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1730,"I'm sorry to hear that it's been so tough for you. It sounds like the coughing is quite distressing and maybe even disruptive. In moments like these, what thoughts do you find yourself having about continuing to smoke or quitting?"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1731,"I think quitting will do my health a lot of good, because in the long run it will be bad for me"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1732,"You're envisioning a future where quitting smoking could significantly benefit your health, and you're recognizing the potential long-term risks of continuing. It's clear that you're weighing these important factors. What would be different for you if you were free from smoking and its effects?"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1733,My health will greatly improve
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1734,"Imagining those improvements in your health can be incredibly motivating. It seems like you can envision a healthier version of yourself without cigarettes. Besides the health benefits, what other positives do you think might come from quitting smoking?"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1735,"At least, I won't spend so much on smoking anymore"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1736,"Being able to save money is another compelling reason to consider quitting. It's not just about better health, but also about feeling more secure or free financially. You're seeing the bigger picture and how various aspects of your life could improve. Is there anything else that stands out to you as a benefit of quitting?"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1737,Nothing else I guess
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1738,You've really highlighted some key benefits like improved health and saving money. Those are substantial motivations. Is there anything else on your mind right now related to smoking or quitting that you'd like to explore further?
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1739,None
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,counsellor,1740,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's take a moment to go over what we've discussed. You mentioned that the coughing is a big concern for you and has been impacting your life terribly. This has led you to think about quitting smoking as a means to improving your health, recognizing the long-term benefits. You also see quitting as a way to manage your finances better, noting that you'll likely spend less. These are clearly meaningful motivators for you as you consider change. I appreciate you taking the time to talk through these with me.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
59,6714f1865fa16b2f979f1d94,client,1741,No
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1742,Hello there! I'm glad to have you here today. How are you feeling as we start this session? I'd love to hear a bit about what brings you here and anything you'd like to share.
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1743,Id like some general information about smoking and quitting smoking.
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1744,"That's definitely something we can explore together. Understanding more about smoking and quitting can be a helpful step. 

I'd like to hear more about your thoughts or feelings around smoking right now. What are some of the things you've been considering when it comes to smoking and possibly quitting?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1745,"Right now, i still enjoy smoking. It really helps me with stress from work and life in general. I do want to quit eventually though. Im just not sure exactly when I want to quit."
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1746,"It sounds like smoking plays a significant role in helping you manage stress, and it’s something you still enjoy. At the same time, you have thoughts about quitting at some point in the future. This mix of feelings is quite common. What are some of the benefits you imagine would come from quitting when you're ready?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1747,"better health of course. also, i would smell better and be looked at in a more positive light by others."
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1748,Better health and a more positive image to others are important benefits you see from quitting. These areas hold significance for you. Balancing these benefits with the comfort and stress relief smoking provides can be challenging. What might make quitting at some point a priority for you?
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1749,mostly if or when i notice any negative health effects that i can attribute directly to smoking.
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1750,"You’re thinking that noticeable health effects related to smoking would push you toward making quitting a priority. Health is clearly important to you. If I may ask, is there anything specific about your health that you're currently keeping an eye on, or are you mainly focused on potential future issues?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1751,"not anything specific, but lung and breathing-related effects. also, heaart-related effects."
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1752,"You're particularly mindful of potential impacts on your lungs, breathing, and heart. Taking care of these aspects of your health is understandably a big concern. How does thinking about these potential health effects impact your current feelings about smoking?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1753,"health effect in general have a big potential to cause other effects for me like anxiety. As i get older, i know my health will start to decline naturally but i dont want to speed them up"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1754,"You're aware that natural aging comes with its own health challenges, and speeding up any decline through smoking is a real concern that could lead to anxiety for you. It seems like maintaining your health as long as possible is important for your peace of mind and quality of life. How do you see this awareness fitting into your journey with smoking right now?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1755,it becomes more of an issue the older i get
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1756,"As you grow older, the importance of these issues increases for you. It's like a sense of urgency is building when it comes to risk and health. What are you noticing about your feelings or expectations as this awareness of aging and potential health concerns becomes more prominent for you?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1757,my appearance is also important to me and i know that smoking could have a big impact on age-related effects visually
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1758,"Appearance is clearly significant to you, and you're thinking about how smoking might influence visual signs of aging. Balancing concerns about health and appearance with your current enjoyment of smoking can be complex. Could you be open to exploring some of these aspects further, maybe thinking about changes you'd like to prioritize in the future?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1759,yes
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1760,"Great, thank you for being open to exploring further. Before we dive into brainstorming any specific changes, is there anything else you'd like to share or discuss? I want to make sure we cover what feels most important to you."
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1761,not right now
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1762,"Thank you for sharing so openly. Here's a quick recap: We talked about how smoking helps with stress and brings enjoyment, but you're also thinking about future health implications and the impact on how you might age visually. Maintaining your health and appearance is clearly significant to you as you consider the future.

With all this in mind, would it be okay if we begin discussing what steps you might consider, either now or in the future, if and when you feel ready to work towards change?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1763,yes
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1764,"Wonderful. When you think about taking steps toward a change, are there any small, manageable actions that come to mind that might fit into your life right now, even if they're just initial steps?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1765,"maybe waiting more time in between the cigarettes i smoke. this would hep cut down. or replacing the habit gradually with other, healthier habits"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1766,"Those are thoughtful approaches. Waiting longer between cigarettes and gradually replacing smoking with healthier habits could help you ease into change. It offers a way to begin adjusting without overwhelming yourself.

Is there a particular healthy habit you're drawn to or curious about trying as a replacement, or would you like to brainstorm some possibilities?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1767,physical exercise and drinking water
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1768,"Incorporating physical exercise and drinking water as alternatives is a positive direction. These habits can support both your health and stress relief, building upon your existing strengths. 

How do you envision integrating these habits into your daily routine? Would it be during times you would typically smoke, or another approach you think might work for you?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1769,"i think making a real effort to exercise daily would motivate me more into smoking less, with the goal of quitting eventually. the positive changes in my health and appearance would be motivation"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1770,"Focusing on daily exercise is a motivating way to build positive momentum. Noticing health and appearance benefits from exercise could indeed encourage you to smoke less and work toward quitting. It sounds like this approach aligns well with your values.

Are there any specific forms of exercise you're considering or excited to try as part of this journey?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1771,running and walking while listening to music and being in nature are things ive become addicted to and enjoyed in the past
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1772,"Running and walking outdoors with music and nature offer a wonderful combination of enjoyment and physical activity. This sounds like a great way to embrace your love for these activities while potentially reducing smoking.

How might you set up your routine to include more of these activities? What first steps feel realistic and supportive for you as you begin this journey?"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,client,1773,"i think the main obstacle would be jsut starting. once i start, i become addicted to doing it daily so i dont lose progress made. i suppose finding the motivation to start would be the first obstacle"
60,6709cc4d966fd4b76c0f0286,counsellor,1774,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. We've reached the length of our session, so I'd like to summarize our conversation to reflect on everything we've discussed.

You've shared that smoking currently helps you manage stress and brings enjoyment, but you're also aware of potential health and appearance impacts, especially as you age. This awareness has you thinking about wanting to maintain your health and appearance without hastening any natural decline.

We've explored how integrating physical exercise such as running or walking, especially with a connection to nature and music, could serve as a motivating alternative to smoking. You’re aware that starting is the biggest hurdle, and yet once begun, you expect the routine will naturally build into a habit that supports your goals.

Your readiness to consider these changes, starting with manageable steps, shows a dedication to your long-term well-being. If you’d like, we can continue exploring these ideas and support your journey in future sessions.

I’m here to continue supporting and listening whenever you feel ready to talk further. Thank you again, and take care."
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1775,Hello there! I'm glad to see you today. How's your week been? Anything interesting or challenging that you'd like to share?
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1776,"I feel quite stressed out at the moment. After a long period of unemployment, i am starting a temporary job next week and am anxious to do well."
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1777,"That sounds like a significant change with a mix of excitement and anxiety. Starting a new job, especially after a break, can really bring up a lot of emotions. It's understandable to feel stressed about wanting to do well. Tell me more about what's on your mind regarding this new job, or anything else you'd like to talk about."
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1778,"I worry that they will expect me to work hours that are not possible for me due to local transport and i am worried that my anxiety to do well, will actually hinder me rather than help me."
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1779,"It's understandable to feel worried about the expectations and logistics around your new job, especially with the added pressure of commute and wanting to perform well. These concerns are quite valid, and it makes sense that they could lead to some anxiety. How have you typically managed stress or anxiety in the past? Is there anything else that's been on your mind?"
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1780,I have not managed stress and anxiety well in the past because i don't really have anyone to talk to about it.
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1781,"It must be really hard not having someone to share your feelings with. Keeping everything inside can really weigh you down. I'm here to listen, and we can talk through whatever you're comfortable sharing. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss when it comes to stress, or anything else you want to bring up today?"
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1782,"Not really, i have just been feeling quite anxious and depressed for some time now, i cant remember what it feels like not to feel this way."
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1783,"It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden for quite a while, and that constant feeling of anxiety and depression can be really challenging. I'm here to support you, and it's okay to feel however you do in this moment. I'm interested in knowing more about your day-to-day life and any patterns or habits that have emerged during this time. Is there anything that you do or have done that seems to temporarily shift your mood or help you cope?"
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1784,Yes. A cigarette and a big glass of wine! I also do voluntary work twice a week which does help. It gets me out of the house and talking to fellow volunteers.
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1785,"It sounds like having a cigarette and a glass of wine has become a way to cope with stress and lift your mood, even temporarily. And it's great to hear that your voluntary work provides a positive outlet and connection with others. It's important to have those moments of interaction and purpose. Would you like to explore more about how smoking fits into your life and how it relates to your feelings and coping mechanisms?"
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1786,I am not sure really. I am perfectly aware that having a cigarette doesnt actually change anything in my life- it just means that i have had another cigarette.
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1787,"You've developed an awareness that smoking doesn't bring lasting change to your situation, even though it might offer some momentary relief. This awareness can be a powerful starting point for exploring your relationship with smoking. How do you feel about this connection between smoking and coping with stress at the moment?"
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1788,"The relief i feel when i have had a cigarette is really mainly psychological, i feel able to cope again and i feel temporarily happier."
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,counsellor,1789,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. We've reached the intended length for our conversation, and I'd like to summarize what we've discussed so far.

You've shared that starting a new job next week has brought on quite a bit of anxiety, particularly around expectations and commuting. You’ve been managing this stress largely on your own and have been feeling anxious and depressed for a while. In confronting these feelings, you've found some temporary relief through smoking and a glass of wine, recognizing that it's mainly psychological. On a positive note, you've also found value in your voluntary work, which brings some respite and connection.

Your awareness of how smoking serves as a temporary comfort has emerged as a point of reflection. These moments of insight into your habits and coping mechanisms are truly valuable, and it's a privilege to walk through this with you. If you'd like to explore any of these topics further, or anything else, I'm here to support you at your pace.

Please take care until we speak again."
61,5cfbf333ac28dd00196e807b,client,1790,Thanks!
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,counsellor,1791,Hello! I'm really glad you could join me today. How are you feeling as we start our session?
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,client,1792,"Hello MIBot, I am feeling  tense from a long day. A bit worried? Why do you ask"
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,counsellor,1793,"Thanks for sharing that with me. It's understandable to feel tense after a long day. Sometimes, when we go through the motions of our daily life, there can be these worries and stresses that build up. I was asking to see how I can best be here for you during our time together. What's been on your mind lately?"
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,client,1794,Yes I too believe the motions of our daily life can cause many emotions like stress and being worried. You can assist by providing with any helpful data regarding or reseach you have on your purpose.
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,counsellor,1795,"I appreciate your openness. It's great to see that you're proactive about seeking information. We can absolutely talk about some of the research and knowledge around smoking and its effects, as well as strategies for change. To tailor our conversation, would you like to share a bit about where smoking fits into your life right now? What are your thoughts or feelings about it?"
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,client,1796,"My has been everywhere lately, and quiting smoking is one of them as this is will be another attemp at quitting for good. the desire and want is there, but eventually i somehow crave in to the urge."
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,counsellor,1797,"It sounds like you're really committed to making a positive change, and you’re experiencing a powerful internal dialogue between your desire to quit and the cravings that surface. It can be tough to navigate those urges, especially when they're persistent. You've made an impressive step by trying in the past—what do you think has helped you resist those cravings before, even for a little while?"
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,client,1798,my last attempt at quitting my smoking habit was a little over a year ago. I was sick of the after taste a cig left in my mouth. that was the main reason. Other reasons were cost and health.
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,counsellor,1799,"You had some really solid reasons driving your last attempt to quit, like discomfort from the aftertaste, as well as the impact on your wallet and health. These factors seem to show a strong understanding of both the immediate and long-term consequences of smoking. It's evident that you've given this a lot of thought. How do these reasons resonate with you today in considering another attempt to quit?"
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,client,1800,"Because I want to quit! I choose to be above the influence, and want to keep my reasons being key in kicking this habit. I figure I have the mind and will to do so. Just need to adapt and act on it."
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,counsellor,1801,"Your determination shines through—it's really clear that you’re committed to making this change happen. The reasons you’ve identified, along with your mindset and willingness, are powerful tools in your journey. Adapting and taking action can certainly come from building on those strengths. Is there anything else you would like us to explore before we talk about the steps or strategies to help you move forward with your plan?"
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,client,1802,"Yes , what are your findings on eliminating the  nicotine substance from a smoker's daily life versus going cold turkey on smoking daily?"
62,653f07a14204d793e710611e,counsellor,1803,"Thank you so much for taking the time to share with me today. We've covered a lot, and it seems we've reached the intended length for today's session. Let me just summarize our conversation so far.

You're at a pivotal point where you're feeling a strong determination to quit smoking, wanting to rise above the influence, and recognizing key reasons like the taste, cost, and health implications. We also talked about your understanding of the challenges, such as dealing with cravings, and your awareness of the positive impact that quitting could have on your life.

You've already made attempts in the past, which shows resilience. As we consider the steps forward, we've touched on finding strengths in your previous efforts and building on them. You have a powerful desire to make this change, and that's a great foundation for success.

I know we were about to discuss different strategies for quitting, including tackling nicotine cravings versus going cold turkey, and we can definitely delve deeper into that next time. It was great to talk with you today, and I look forward to supporting you further on your journey. Feel free to reflect on anything we've discussed, and we can pick up right where we left off. Take care until then!"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1804,Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How have things been going for you recently?
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1805,"cant complain,am doing fine"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1806,"I'm glad to hear that you're doing fine. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about today, or perhaps something on your mind that you're considering making a change in?"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1807,a change in my smoking although its not a decision made fully
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1808,"Those feelings are completely understandable. Smoking can be a difficult habit to tackle, and it's normal to have mixed feelings about it. What are some of the thoughts going through your mind as you consider this change?"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1809,"how would it be without smoking,or what if i stop smoking and get tempted to smoking again"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1810,"It sounds like you're thinking about both what life might be like without smoking, as well as having some concerns about the possibility of wanting to smoke again. Those are important questions. What do you imagine life could be like if you were to stop smoking?"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1811,somewhat weird
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1812,"There's an uncertainty there, and that's quite normal when considering such a significant change. It could feel different or unusual at first, considering the role smoking might play in your daily life. What would you see as being some of the potential benefits or good things, if you were to successfully stop smoking?"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1813,maybe the headaches i have without smoking would eventually end
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1814,Focusing on the health benefits like potentially reducing those headaches can be a real incentive. It's encouraging to hear you identify a positive outcome from making a change. Are there other positive impacts you think quitting smoking might have on your life?
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1815,not sure
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1816,"That's okay. It's a journey to explore and identify the benefits. You've already mentioned a significant one with the headaches. Maybe in time, more positives will become clear for you. Is there anything specific that might be holding you back from fully deciding to make this change?"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1817,"yes,its like a pleasure to me"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1818,"It sounds like smoking provides some enjoyment or relaxation for you, which can make the idea of changing challenging. Balancing that sense of pleasure with your thoughts about quitting is a significant part of this process. Are there other ways in your life where you find pleasure or relaxation, or is smoking primarily that outlet for you?"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1819,"no,its my primarily outlet"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1820,"Relying on smoking as your primary form of relaxation can make the idea of quitting feel even more complicated. It's important to consider how this change could impact your sense of relaxation and pleasure. Exploring alternative outlets might be something to think about as you weigh your options. How do you feel about the idea of finding new ways to unwind or enjoy yourself, in addition to or instead of smoking?"
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1821,maybe i can give it a trial
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,counsellor,1822,Being open to exploring new options is a great step. It could be an opportunity to discover activities or practices that provide relaxation or enjoyment and complement or even replace smoking. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or discuss before we think about potential next steps together?
63,6733afc24000cce390aa2575,client,1823,no

64,604bd44cb5668ba12cc9376e,counsellor,1836,"That's really heartwarming to hear. Having that close bond must be very special for both of you. As you're enjoying this renewed connection with your grandson, have you noticed it impacting other areas of your life or things you've been thinking about recently?"

65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1855,It has been good at times but sometimes can be very not un easy
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1856,"It sounds like smoking brings a mix of feelings for you. On one hand, there's something good about it, but on the other, it can also lead to moments of unease. What more can you tell me about that experience?"
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1857,The coughing it causes can sometimes really be terrible
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1858,That coughing must be uncomfortable for you. It seems like its impact on your health is something you find concerning. How do you feel about that connection between smoking and the coughing?

65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1865,I think it is best if i can really be serious about quiting smoking
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1866,It sounds like you're recognizing the value of quitting as it relates to your health goals. You're considering taking a serious step towards change. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore further before we possibly consider what that process might look like for you?

65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1868,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's take a moment to go over what we've talked about. We've explored how smoking brings both enjoyable moments with flavors and a sense of unease with the coughing it causes. You mentioned your strong commitment to good health and expressed concern about the long-term risks like cancer. This led you to consider that quitting smoking might align better with your health priorities. If you're ever ready, we can explore these ideas further.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1869,"Yes, let's continue."
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1870,Great! We've recognized your motivation for good health and the wish to quit smoking. Can we think together about what kind of first steps you might like to take towards quitting?
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1871,Taking therapies and also surrounding my self with people who do not smoke and go to the gym
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1872,"Those sound like thoughtful and positive steps—seeking therapies, changing your surroundings, and engaging in physical activities like going to the gym. Each of these can play a valuable role in supporting your journey. How do you feel about putting these plans into action?"
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1873,I feel very positive about the outcome
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1874,"It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling positive about these changes. That kind of optimism can provide strong support in your journey. Remember, taking it step by step can make the process more manageable. What would you consider as your first action in moving toward these goals?"
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1875,going to the gym
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1876,Starting with the gym could be a great way to build momentum. Exercise can offer both physical benefits and a healthy distraction from smoking. When do you think you’d like to start with this new routine?
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1877,in few weeks time i can say
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1878,"That sounds like a realistic and thoughtful timeframe. Planning to introduce a new routine in a few weeks gives you time to prepare mentally and physically. What, if anything, can you do now to set yourself up for success when that time comes?"
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1879,Reading books something that will keep me busy in oder to avoid smoking
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1880,Reading can be a wonderful way to keep your mind engaged and distracted from the temptation to smoke. It’s also a chance to learn and enjoy different stories or information. You seem to have a plan that's flexible and supportive of your goals. How do you feel about starting with some book choices to accompany your journey before heading to the gym?
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1881,i feel very much comfortable
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1882,That's great to hear. Feeling comfortable with the steps you're taking can make a big difference in sustaining your progress. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore as you think about these plans and your journey ahead?
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1883,nope there is not thank you
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,counsellor,1884,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and plans with me today. Let's go over the key points we've discussed. You talked about the ambivalence you feel around smoking, where you enjoy the flavors and social aspects but also deal with negative health impacts like coughing. Health is a significant priority for you, and you've expressed concern about the long-term risks associated with smoking. You’ve shared your desire to quit and feel positive about the change, considering steps such as going to the gym and surrounding yourself with non-smokers. Planning to read books as a way to distract from smoking appears to be a comfortable choice for you too. Your motivation and positivity towards these changes are commendable, and you have set a thoughtful path to start with introducing the gym into your routine in a few weeks. It’s been valuable hearing your plans, and I'm here to support you in any way that helps as you move forward.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
65,672240fa735fc09f3c8d4581,client,1885,No
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1886,Hi there! Thanks for joining me today. How are you feeling as we get started?
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1887,Keen to start
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1888,"Great to hear that you're keen to dive in! So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you and where smoking fits into your life these days."
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1889,"I have smoked for many years and would like to stop, but I am addicted to smoking and smoke around 20-30 per day. I would like for health reasons to quit"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1890,"It sounds like you've been dealing with smoking for a long time, and you're thinking about quitting mainly to benefit your health. Quitting something that's been a big part of your life isn't easy, and there might be a mixture of feelings about it. What are some of the health reasons that are encouraging you to think about stopping?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1891,Mainly coughing and breathing
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1892,"It sounds like the coughing and breathing challenges are really affecting you, perhaps even on a daily basis. That must be uncomfortable and concerning. How has this impacted your day-to-day life or activities you enjoy?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1893,A simple walk can be hard and can leave me feeling breathless
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1894,"That sounds really tough, especially if something as simple as going for a walk leaves you feeling breathless. It seems like this has had a significant impact on your enjoyment of even everyday activities. How important is it for you to make those walks, and other activities, feel more comfortable again?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1895,As I am getting older I think it is important to try and walk regularly.
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1896,"You're recognizing the importance of staying active as you get older, and it sounds like you want to make sure walking and other activities remain part of your life. That seems like a strong motivation to think about making changes with smoking. Besides these health reasons, are there any other aspects of your life that you’ve been thinking about in relation to quitting smoking?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1897,The big C - cancer. Cost is not relevant as I live abroad and cigarettes are quite cheap.
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1898,"The concern about cancer is powerful, and it shows just how much you value your long-term health. It's interesting that the cost isn't a significant factor for you, but the health risks are definitely weighing on your mind. This awareness can be quite motivating when contemplating a change. What are your thoughts about moving forward in relation to smoking and the risk of cancer?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1899,I would like to stop and improve my health.
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1900,"That's a clear and meaningful goal – stopping smoking with the aim of improving your health. It sounds like you're getting closer to being ready for this change. Before we explore how you might start moving towards that goal, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to discuss?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1901,"Struggling this year with family and friends deaths, which makes me reach out for a cigarette"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1902,"I'm truly sorry to hear about the loss of your family and friends this year. That kind of grief and stress can make anyone seek comfort, and for you, it seems like cigarettes have been a way to cope during this difficult time. It's understandable that the emotional challenges might be making it harder to focus on quitting. How are you feeling dealing with these losses, and is there any support around you that helps?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1903,Just try to remember the good times and fond memories.
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1904,"Appreciating those good times and fond memories sounds like a meaningful way to honor the relationships and cherish what they meant to you. It can be a comforting way to cope and keep those connections alive in your heart. Balancing grief and making changes like quitting smoking is challenging. As you remember those moments, how do you feel about finding new ways to support yourself through this time, possibly without relying on smoking?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1905,That would be helpful
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1906,"I'm really glad to hear that considering new support methods sounds helpful to you. Maybe we can think about some ways together that might support you, especially during those moments when you feel the urge to reach for a cigarette. Would you like to explore a few ideas on how to strengthen your support system or healthy coping strategies?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1907,Yes I would
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1908,"Thank you for your trust. Before we dive into specific ideas, let's take a moment to reflect on what we've talked about so far. You've identified health concerns and the impact of smoking on activities like walking, the significant influence of stress and grief, and a strong desire to quit smoking to improve your health. Does that cover everything you wanted to discuss before we explore some potential next steps?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1909,Yes correct
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1910,"Great, and thanks for confirming. Would you feel comfortable if we start discussing some potential strategies now, focusing on tailoring them to suit your needs and making sure they feel right for you?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1911,Yes please
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1912,"Thank you for your openness. Here are a few initial steps that might support you:

1. **Mindful Breathing or Relaxation Techniques**: When you're feeling the urge to smoke, especially in stressful times, practicing mindful breathing could help. It might offer a calming effect similar to what you seek from smoking.

2. **Memory and Remembrance Activities**: You mentioned cherishing good memories; maybe engaging in activities that celebrate these memories, like writing in a journal or creating a memory scrapbook, could be comforting.

3. **Support Network**: Reaching out to friends, family, or even a support group might provide a sense of connection when you’re feeling low and help in moments you used to turn to smoking.

4. **Physical Activity**: Gradually working on activities you enjoy, if they feel comfortable, could encourage a healthy routine that benefits your breathing and overall wellness.

What resonates with you, or is there anything specific that you'd like to focus on or adapt?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1913,I would like to try and get more physical
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1914,That's fantastic! Gradually incorporating physical activity into your routine could really support your health and might help with easing some of that breathlessness. It's great that you're willing to focus on this. What kind of physical activities do you enjoy or feel drawn to at this stage?
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1915,I would prefer walks
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1916,"Starting with walking sounds like a wonderful choice, especially as it's something you mentioned you find important to do regularly. It can be beneficial in boosting both physical and mental well-being. Would you like to consider setting small, manageable goals for incorporating regular walks into your routine?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1917,"Yes, that I think would work"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1918,"Setting small, achievable goals can make it easier to build a consistent routine. You might start by setting a specific time each day for a short walk, something that feels comfortable and manageable for you. As you get more comfortable, you could gradually increase the distance or the pace at your own rhythm. How does the idea of starting with a short, daily walk sound to you?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1919,Sounds good
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1920,"I'm glad to hear that sounds good to you. It's a positive step forward. As you begin this new walking routine, you might find it helpful to notice any changes in how you feel, both physically and emotionally, and let that inform your progress. If any challenges arise or you need to make adjustments, feel free to bring them up in our future conversations. How do you feel about moving forward with this plan?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1921,Good
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1922,"That's wonderful to hear! Take your time as you ease into this new routine, and know that each step is a step toward where you want to be. If you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss in our future sessions, feel free to reach out. I'm here to support you along the way. Thank you for being open and engaged in this conversation today."
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1923,Weight gain would also be important
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,counsellor,1924,"Thank you so much for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You've shared that you've been smoking for many years, smoking about 20-30 cigarettes a day. You're motivated to quit primarily for health reasons, like the coughing, breathing difficulties, and the big concern over cancer. Managing stress from family and friends' deaths has been a challenge, and you've been seeking new ways to cope, like exploring physical activities. Together, we've discussed trying to incorporate more regular walks into your routine as a way to gradually improve your health and well-being. We've also touched on ideas like mindful breathing and finding support in memory and remembrance activities. As you take these next steps, remember that it's about finding what feels right for you at your own pace. Feel free to bring anything else up in our future sessions.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
66,65afd259807fecf459149c11,client,1925,No
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1926,Hi there! I'm really glad you're here today. How are you feeling as we start our conversation?
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1927,I'm feeling good
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1928,"Great to hear that! I'm here to support you in any way you need today. If it's okay with you, I’d like to learn a bit more about your journey with smoking. What’s been your relationship with it so far?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1929,I've been smoking since I was 22 years old. I'm 39 years old now.
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1930,That's quite a journey with smoking over the years. It must have become a significant part of your daily life. How do you feel about cigarette smoking at this point in your life?
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1931,I feel like I'm dependent on it but don't want to be.
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1932,"That sounds like a tough place to be in, feeling that pull of dependency while not wanting it. It seems like there's a part of you that's thinking about smoking differently. Can you tell me more about what's going on in your mind when you think about your smoking?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1933,I feel like it's releaving stress
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1934,"Smoking seems to offer you some relief from stress, which can be really valuable. At the same time, you've mentioned you don't want to feel dependent on it. That sounds like a bit of a conflict for you. What are your thoughts on other things you might do to manage stress, with or without smoking?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1935,I might try to eat or drink
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1936,"Eating or drinking to manage stress could be an interesting option for you. Finding alternatives can sometimes shift the focus. Is this something you have tried before, or is it a new idea you're considering?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1937,It's a new idea. I never tried it
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1938,"Exploring new ways to manage stress can open up different possibilities. It sounds like you're considering some fresh ideas, and that's great. What's drawing you towards trying this new approach now?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1939,I want to try to quit for my family and my own health
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1940,"You have some really strong motivations, like your family and your own health. Those are powerful reasons that can guide you as you think about the changes you want to make. How do you picture things changing for you and your family if you were to quit smoking?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1941,I want to try to quit for my family and my own health
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1942,Imagining a future without smoking and the positive impact it could have on your health and your family can be a strong motivator. It seems like you've given this a lot of thought. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your relationship with smoking or the changes you're considering?
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1943,Not really
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1944,"Alright, thank you for sharing all of that with me. To recap, we've talked about your long history with smoking, the stress relief it provides, and your desire to quit for your family's well-being and your own health. Would you like to discuss some possible steps or strategies to move forward with your goals, if you feel ready?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1945,Sure
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1946,"Great! We can explore some steps together. Before we dive into that, is there a particular approach or support you've considered or heard about that you might be interested in trying first?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1947,I'm thinking about starting to vape
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1948,"Switching to vaping is something a lot of people consider when looking to change their smoking habits. For some, it can be a step towards reducing tobacco use. How do you see vaping fitting into your journey of cutting back on smoking and working toward your goals for your health and family?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1949,I'm thinking about starting to vape
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1950,It sounds like you're seriously considering vaping as a possible part of your plan. Many people view it as a stepping stone or an alternative. What do you hope vaping might help you achieve in relation to the changes you're thinking about making with smoking?
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1951,I think it would substitute the action of smoking a cigarette
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1952,"You're thinking about how vaping might fulfill the habit and routine aspect of smoking, without some of the things you want to move away from. It could be an interesting strategy to explore. How confident are you in taking this step, and what support might you need along the way?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1953,I think it would work
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1954,"Believing that this approach could work is an important step. Having confidence in your ability to implement change can be very empowering. As you consider vaping as an alternative, how do you plan to start, and is there anything you might need to make this transition a bit smoother for you?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1955,I plan to just buy the vape and try to immediately switch to the vape. Not gradual.
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1956,"That’s a decisive plan you have, aiming to make a direct switch. Taking such a clear step can sometimes make the transition feel more straightforward. What might help you stay on track with this plan once you've made the switch?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1957,Just quitting cigarettes cold turkey
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1958,"Going cold turkey with cigarettes can be challenging but also very rewarding. Your determination and clarity about making this change stand out and may help you in the process. Are there any people, activities, or other supports you think might help keep you motivated and focused as you make this leap?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1959,My wife and my family would help
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1960,Having the support of your wife and family can be incredibly valuable as you navigate this change. Knowing they are there for you might offer encouragement and strength. How do you envision involving them in your journey to ensure their support is most helpful to you?
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1961,Just keeping me on track and trying to distract me if I'm getting a real craving
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1962,"That sounds like a really supportive plan, having your family help you stay focused and provide distractions during those moments of craving. Having this kind of encouragement and involvement from your loved ones can make a big difference. Is there anything else you'd like to consider or prepare before you start this new chapter?"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1963,Nothing else
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1964,"Alright, thank you for sharing everything with me. You've identified some strong motivations and a clear plan with support from your family, and those are important parts of making a successful change. If you ever feel the need to talk more about this journey or need additional support, feel free to reach out. Wishing you strength and success as you take these steps forward!"
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,client,1965,Thanks
67,664d8066db4407ac502a5979,counsellor,1966,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let me summarize what we’ve discussed so far.

68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1969,Good
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1970,I'm glad to hear that. What comes to mind when you think about your smoking these days?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1971,Sad thoughts
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1972,It sounds like smoking is bringing up some difficult emotions for you. Would you be open to sharing a bit more about what's making you feel that way?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1973,I'm worried about my health
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1974,That's understandable. It's a concern that many people share. What specifically about your health has been on your mind?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1975,I get breathless easily
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1976,"That must be frustrating, especially if it's affecting your daily activities. How do you currently manage these feelings of breathlessness?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1977,I don't really. I just have to stop and catch my breath
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1978,"Catching your breath must be challenging, especially if it happens often. How does this impact your everyday life or the things you love to do?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1979,I can't so things I enjoy for very long
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1980,"That sounds tough, especially when it's things you enjoy that you might have to pause. What are some of those activities you wish you could do more freely?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1981,Cycling
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1982,It must be hard to feel limited in something like cycling that brings joy and freedom. I imagine being able to cycle easily would mean a lot to you. What do you think about the possibility of making some changes that might help you cycle more comfortably?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1983,I'm open to it
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1984,"That's a great place to start, being open to exploring changes. Is there anything else on your mind about smoking or your health that you'd like to talk about before we move on?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1985,No
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1986,"Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. You've mentioned some important things, like your worries about health, feeling breathless, and how it's affecting your ability to cycle, an activity you enjoy. You also expressed a willingness to consider making some changes.

With your permission, would you like to explore some options or steps that could help you move towards cycling more comfortably?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1987,Yes
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1988,Great! We can start by considering what small steps might feel manageable for you. We can explore various approaches and see what aligns best with your lifestyle and goals. What thoughts or ideas do you have in mind when you think about taking a step towards change?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1989,Reducing the number of cigarettes I smoke each day
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1990,That's a thoughtful approach. Reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke each day could be a significant step toward improving your breath and enjoying cycling more. How do you feel about setting a specific goal for how many cigarettes you'd like to cut down each day?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1991,Sounds good
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1992,Great! Setting a specific goal can help make the change feel more manageable and trackable. What number feels achievable and realistic to you when it comes to cutting back each day?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1993,5
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1994,Five fewer cigarettes a day sounds like a solid starting point. It's a manageable step that can make a significant difference over time. How would you like to track your progress and stay motivated with this goal?
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1995,I'm not sure
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1996,"That's okay, and totally normal when starting something new. We could explore different methods. Some people find it helpful to keep a journal or use an app to track the number of cigarettes. Others might set reminders or reward themselves after reaching their daily goal. Does any of that resonate with you, or is there another approach you'd like to try?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1997,Use an app
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,1998,"Using an app can be a convenient way to keep track of your progress and maintain motivation. Many apps offer features like setting goals, tracking reductions, and even reminders or encouraging messages. It can help to see your progress in a visual way. Would you like support in finding an app that suits your needs, or do you have something in mind already?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,1999,Yes
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,2000,"I'd be happy to help you explore some options. There are a number of apps designed to support people in reducing or quitting smoking. They often include features like goal-setting, progress tracking, and tips to help manage cravings. Taking some time to find one that feels right for you can be a great step. How do you feel about trying this out as you work toward your goal?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,2001,Yea
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,2002,"It's great to hear you're ready to give it a try. Remember, this process is about your journey and what works best for you. If any challenges come up or you want to adjust your plan, we can explore that together. It's all about finding the right fit that supports your aim of enjoying cycling more. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we wrap up for today?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,2003,No
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,counsellor,2004,"Thank you for our conversation today. We've explored some meaningful topics around your smoking, including your worries about health and breathlessness, which affects your cycling enjoyment. You expressed openness to change and decided to take a step by reducing your cigarette intake by five each day. We discussed using an app to track this progress, which can help you visualize and stay motivated. Remember, this journey is personal, and adjustments along the way are perfectly okay. I'm here to support you as you work toward your goals. Looking forward to our next session.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
68,629e42a3800b66722644beda,client,2005,No
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2006,Hello there! I'm really glad you've decided to join me today. How are you doing?
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,client,2007,"Fine , thanks"
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2008,I'm glad to hear that. What brings you to our session today?
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,client,2009,I’m here to better understand my smoking habits
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2010,That's a great first step. It sounds like you're curious about what drives your smoking habits. Tell me more about your experiences with smoking—what's it been like for you?
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,client,2011,"I started smoking after a tough breakup. It felt like it helped me cope with the pain and the loneliness. Now, it’s just something I do when I feel overwhelmed or down."
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2012,"It's understandable that smoking became a way for you to manage those difficult emotions after your breakup. It sounds like it has since become a habit for you in times of stress or feeling low. Have you noticed any other ways smoking impacts your life, either positively or negatively?"
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,client,2013,"I’ve noticed that smoking gives me a temporary sense of relief, but it’s also starting to affect my health. I’m more winded than I used to be, and I don’t feel as energetic."
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2014,"You're aware that smoking provides a momentary relief, but you're also seeing its effects on your health and energy levels. It sounds like there’s a part of you that values feeling healthier and more energetic. How do you feel about that?"
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,client,2015,"I definitely miss feeling more energetic. I used to have more stamina, and now I feel like I’m dragging. I know that being healthier is important to me, but it’s hard to break the habit."
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2016,It's understandable; letting go of a habit that's been a source of comfort can be challenging. You're seeing the importance of your health and the energy you miss having. What do you think might be different if smoking wasn’t part of your life?
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,client,2017,"If smoking wasn’t part of my life, I think I’d feel more in control of my health. I’d probably have more energy throughout the day"
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2018,"Imagining a life without smoking, you're seeing a picture of feeling more in control and having increased energy. These potential changes seem significant to you. What thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about the possibility of making this change?"
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,client,2019,"Part of me feels hopeful, like I could actually get back to feeling like myself again. But at the same time, I’m also nervous—what if I can’t stick with it? It feels like a big challenge."
69,671cc08bbf9ca032aba042aa,counsellor,2020,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings today. Our conversation has reached its intended length, so let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed.

You've shared that smoking began as a way to cope with a tough breakup, and now it's something you do when you're feeling overwhelmed or down. You've also noticed that while smoking gives you temporary relief, it's impacting your health and energy levels. You miss feeling more energetic and in control of your health, and you're envisioning a future where you could regain that vitality.

There are feelings of hope about making a change and becoming healthier, but there's also some nervousness and doubt about whether you can stick with it, acknowledging the challenge it presents.

You've been open and reflective today, and that's an important step in exploring these feelings about smoking. Thank you again for sharing your journey with me today. If there's more you'd like to explore or discuss in the future, I'm here to support you. Take care."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2021,Hi there! I'm really glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling as we begin our conversation?
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2022,I am feeling good.
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2023,"That's great to hear. I'm here to support you in whatever way you need. Is there anything specific on your mind today that you'd like to talk about, perhaps related to smoking or anything else?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2024,"sure, the study is about quitting smoking."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2025,"Absolutely. Quitting smoking can be a big step, and it's common to have mixed feelings about it. What are some of the thoughts or feelings you have when you think about quitting?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2026,"I have tried before in the past, 3 different times and the first time I quit cold turkey and started having horrible mood swings and night sweats that would wake me up that was about 8 years ago."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2027,"You put in a lot of effort to quit smoking before, and faced uncomfortable experiences like mood swings and night sweats. Those sound like they were really challenging for you. What keeps you thinking about trying again?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2028,Well my past two times I attempted I tried patches and the first time failed after a month and the second time I had a horrible reaction with the patches and gave me a large welt and scar from the pat
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2029,"You've had some tough experiences with quitting, like the skin reaction from the patches and the difficulties during your cold turkey attempt. Even after those challenges, it seems there's still something motivating you to consider quitting again. What are some reasons why quitting feels important to you now?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2030,"Health, it is fine but I worry about cancer. 

I have horrible morning coughs and I've grown used to it, I have been smoking since I was 13 and now I am about to turn 32. 

I am not pleased with that."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2031,"You've been smoking for quite a while, and the health concerns are really weighing on your mind now, especially with things like the morning cough and the risk of cancer. It sounds like you're ready to make a change for your health, and you're not happy with the way things have been going. How do you feel about the possibility of living without those smoke-related worries?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2032,I would love that and so would my family and my wallet.
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2033,"It sounds like living without smoking would have some really positive effects, not just for your health, but also for your family and your finances. It's clear that you're thinking about quitting from multiple angles, recognizing the benefits. As you imagine this smoke-free life, what do you think might be your first steps toward making it a reality?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2034,"No idea anymore, I don't want to lose hope but my last attempt was 2 years ago and don't know how to make it successful this time."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2035,"It's understandable to feel uncertain, especially after past attempts. It's very encouraging to hear that you still want to try and haven't lost hope. Would you like to explore some ideas together about what might help make this attempt more successful?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2036,Yes absolutely.
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2037,"Great! Before we dive into planning, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to discuss or explore?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2038,"No, just that."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2039,"Alright, let's reflect on what we've talked about so far: You've shown a lot of determination by trying to quit multiple times in the past, and even though you've faced some tough challenges, your desire to improve your health is strong. You're also considering the positive impact quitting could have on your family and finances. With all of that in mind, would you like to explore some potential strategies and supports to assist you this time around?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2040,"Yes, give me some ideas or insight."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2041,"Sure! Here are a few strategies some people find helpful when considering quitting smoking:

1. **Support Systems**: Engaging family, friends, or a support group can provide encouragement and accountability. Do you have people in your life who might support you in this journey?

2. **Gradual Reduction**: Some people find success by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes over time instead of quitting all at once. What do you think of that approach?

3. **Professional Help**: Seeking guidance from healthcare professionals or counsellors by using resources like quitsmokinglines to receive tailored advice and support. Have you considered reaching out for professional support before?

4. **Mindfulness and Stress Management**: Engaging in techniques to manage stress like meditation or exercise, can help address the emotional triggers for smoking. Is stress a significant factor for you when trying to quit?

Are any of these options appealing to you, or do you have other ideas in mind you'd like to explore?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2042,"1 my whole support team smokes, 2 I never manage to once I have time off I smoke more, 3 wouldn't even know how to approach this and 4 I try but I don't have the finances to buy weights and to have a"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2043,"You've faced challenges in each area, whether it's the environment around you, managing smoking habits during downtime, or accessing professional support and stress management resources. It's clear you're thinking this through carefully, and it's understandable that these obstacles feel daunting.

Maybe starting small and finding new ways to address these challenges could help. For example, perhaps:
- You could have open conversations with your support team about your quitting goals, offering the opportunity for understanding or even joining you in the journey.
- If possible, establishing routines for specific times when smoking increases, and substituting those with different activities, could help.
- Exploring local community services or online resources might bring professional support within reach.
- Simple activities like walking, stretching, or using free online exercises could offer manageable stress relief. 

How do you feel about any of these ideas? Would any be worth trying or adapting to better suit your situation?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2044,"Stress would be a factor for sure, but when the mood swings hit I don't know how to deal with them."
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2045,"The mood swings can be tough, especially when they're linked to stress and withdrawal. Finding manageable ways to cope with stress and those emotional shifts is important. Perhaps focusing on stress-relief activities that don't require a lot of resources could be beneficial:

- Simple breathing exercises or short, calming activities, like a brief walk or listening to music, might help.
- Creating a list of distraction techniques or activities you enjoy could be handy when you feel mood swings coming on.
- Talking about these feelings with someone supportive or taking a break to write in a journal can sometimes help process emotions.

Would exploring any of these ideas feel feasible for you? Or do you have in mind something else that might help manage those mood swings when they arise?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2046,That seems like I should work on that first.
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2047,"Focusing on stress relief and managing mood swings sounds like a solid foundation for your quit-smoking journey. It's a thoughtful way to prepare yourself emotionally before tackling the challenge outright. Would you like to discuss specific steps or strategies to support you in this area, or is there another approach you'd prefer to explore?"
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,client,2048,no that is it.
70,608f39d2c76e436967135846,counsellor,2049,"Thank you for sharing so much with me today. Let's summarize what we've discussed: You've shown a strong desire to quit smoking, motivated by concerns for your health and the impact on your family and finances. You've faced some challenging past experiences trying to quit, like uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and reactions to patches. We explored some strategies together, considering the possibility of seeking support, managing stress with accessible activities, and creating new routines to help manage mood swings. Focusing on stress relief felt like a priority for you at this stage, which seems like a thoughtful step forward. Remember, your determination to try again is a crucial strength, and preparing to manage stress and emotions can set a solid foundation for your next attempt.

It's nice to hear you enjoyed that. With this peaceful setting in mind, I'd appreciate it if you'd share any thoughts or feelings you might have about smoking, especially during a day like today."
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2058,I do tend to smoke less when I am not in a pressure environment on day to day basis I am more relaxed
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2059,It sounds like being in a more relaxed and pressure-free environment helps reduce the urge to smoke. There's a sense of ease you feel when you're in those calmer settings. How does that contrast with times when you do find yourself smoking more often?
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2060,I smoke more to escape arom the pressure cor a bit in usual circumstances and calm me down
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2061,"When you're facing pressure and need an escape, turning to smoking offers a momentary sense of calm and relief. It seems like it's a way to manage stress in those hectic moments. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in handling stress for you?"
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2062,it helps to calm me down have some peace for a bit or a chat while I smoke to let of steam
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2063,"Smoking seems to serve as a way to both find a moment of peace and to connect with others, giving you the space to let off steam. It offers some relief in times of stress. How do you feel about relying on smoking in these ways, and how do you see that impacting your life?"
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2064,it does not help me like to cind something else
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2065,"You're recognizing that while smoking offers temporary relief, it's not quite helping you in the way you might want in the long run. You're open to exploring other ways to manage stress and find peace. What might be appealing about finding new approaches for handling stress?"
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2066,yes it would be helpful to find another coping mechanism
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2067,"Wanting to find a different coping mechanism shows that you're really considering alternatives that might better serve your well-being. Is there anything in particular that you've thought about trying, or are there certain activities that interest you as potential new ways to cope?"
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2068,I suppose coffee and tea or chewing gum
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2069,"Exploring coffee, tea, or chewing gum as alternatives suggests you're thinking about accessible and simple options that might work for you. It sounds like you're open to experimenting with these substitutes to see if they help provide that moment of peace. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about as we explore your thoughts on making changes?"
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2070,just looking for ideas to help coffee or tea sometimes help to limited effect but also not great drinking to much of them
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2071,"You're mindful of the effects of leaning too much on coffee or tea, even though they offer some relief. It's thoughtful that you're considering a balanced approach, acknowledging both the positives and limitations. Would it be alright if we talk a bit about some ideas that might support you in finding healthier coping options?"
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2072,yes ok
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2073,"Thank you for allowing me to share some ideas with you. We've talked about how important it is to find something that helps you cope with stress without relying on smoking. A few things that could complement your current choices could include:

1. **Deep Breathing or Meditation:** Taking some quiet moments for yourself might offer relief similar to a cigarette break.

2. **Physical Activity:** Short walks or simple exercises may help reduce stress and improve mood.

3. **Mindful Activities:** Engaging in activities like reading or puzzles can offer a mental escape and relaxation.

Throughout this process, it's important to experiment with these ideas to see what best supports you in achieving the sense of peace you desire. What do you think about exploring these possibilities, and do any resonate with you?"

This signifies you are aware of the challenges that come with trying something new. It’s important to recognize that finding the right approach takes time and can involve some trial and error. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other thoughts you'd like to share at this point?"

71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,counsellor,2079,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about. You began by sharing how a relaxed day out in nature reduced your urge to smoke. We also discussed how smoking helps you cope with stress, acting as a temporary escape and offering moments of peace, especially in high-pressure situations. You've acknowledged smoking isn't quite the long-term solution you're seeking, and you're open to exploring alternatives. We brainstormed together, considering things like deep breathing, meditation, physical activities, and mindful activities as potential new coping mechanisms. You're ready to give these a try, even while recognizing the challenge of transitioning during times of strong urge. It's a promising start, and I'm here to support you as you explore these new pathways. If there's anything more on your mind, feel free to reach out whenever you'd like.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
71,63d53d53a7a7b0379ba289cf,client,2080,No
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2081,Hello there! It's great to meet you. How are you feeling today?
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2082,Feeling stressed.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2083,I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed. It's understandable; life can be overwhelming at times. Would you like to share what's been on your mind recently? It might help to talk it through.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2084,I'm just from smoking my third cigarrete today and I have another on my hand now ready to smoke.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2085,It sounds like smoking is playing a role in how you're dealing with your stress right now. It can be tough when you feel the need to reach for a cigarette in stressful moments. What are your thoughts about having that cigarette in your hand?
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2086,I'm really conflicted about it.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2087,"That inner conflict can be really challenging to navigate. On one hand, you might feel like smoking offers comfort or relief, while on the other, there might be hesitation or concerns about it. Could you tell me more about what these different parts of you are saying?"
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2088,I feel the urge to smoke and maybe relax but on the other hand I know and have started experiencing the negative impacts it has on my body.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2089,"Balancing the immediate relief you seek with the longer-term impact on your health sounds like a difficult situation. It's understandable to want to feel relaxed, yet also be aware of the potential consequences. How do these experiences and thoughts about smoking and its effects fit into your life right now?"
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2090,"The urge has overcome me here it goes, let me smoke this one as I think more about it."
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2091,"I hear you taking a moment to sort through your thoughts. It can be challenging when the urge feels strong. As you reflect, would you like to explore further the role smoking plays in your life and how it relates to those immediate and longer-term feelings and health concerns? It's perfectly okay to take small steps in understanding and resolving these feelings."
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2092,"It has been a tough journey, it has caused many hardships in my life and family but I can't seem to stop, I try and at this moment I think I'll just smoke till it eventually kills me."
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2093,"That sounds incredibly difficult, and it's clear that smoking has had a significant impact on both you and your family. Feeling trapped by something that brings hardship can be exhausting. Your willingness to talk about it and reflect on these challenges is an important step. What do you think would be most helpful for you to focus on right now in this conversation?"
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2094,I just want to know how I can make it stop it's killing me slowly but surely I can't take it no more.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2095,"Wanting to stop smoking is a strong and meaningful goal for you, especially considering the toll it has taken on your life. Acknowledging that desire to change is an important first step. Before we explore what stopping might look like, is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your experience with smoking so far, or how your readiness to change has evolved over time? This way, we can ensure we're addressing the full picture before moving forward."
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2096,Let's start I hear first what you have in mind I can't just tell you everything blindly.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2097,"I understand wanting to approach this carefully. Thank you for expressing that. From what we've discussed so far, you've been feeling a strong desire and readiness to stop smoking given its impacts on your life. You've shown a lot of courage by sharing your experiences and willingness to talk about change. Let's explore, if you're comfortable, what a first step might look like for you. Would it be okay to discuss that and see what feels manageable to you?"
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2098,Yes it would be fine.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2099,"Great, thank you for that. One possible first step could be to think about the reasons you want to quit smoking and what benefits that might bring to you and your family. This can help strengthen your motivation as you consider making changes. From what you've shared, what do you think would be the most important benefits for you if you were to stop smoking?"
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2100,Better health and family relations.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2101,Those are meaningful reasons to consider change. Imagining the possibility of better health and stronger family relationships could serve as powerful motivators for you. How do you envision these improvements impacting your day-to-day life and your future?
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,client,2102,Its has been long I can't even tell what's on the other side of noy smoking. I'm hoping maybe that most of my problems will end after I quit this habit of smoking.
72,67367d0a333a8316c597fe24,counsellor,2103,"Thank you for taking the time to talk today. We've reached the intended length for our conversation, so let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed.

You've shared how smoking has played a role in your life, particularly as a way to cope with stress, yet you've also felt conflicted about its impact on your health and family relationships. You expressed a desire to quit smoking as it has been a source of hardship. We explored some initial thoughts about the positive changes you hope to see, such as better health and improving family connections.

Throughout our conversation, we've acknowledged the challenges you've faced and the strength in your desire for change. As you've reflected on both the immediate and long-term effects, it's clear that you're considering how different your life might be without smoking.

As you continue to think about these insights, remember you have the courage and awareness that brought you here. If you're interested, we can explore these thoughts further in our next session and continue to build on what we've started today.

Thank you again for sharing your journey with me. Please feel free to reach out whenever you're ready to talk more."
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2104,"Hello there! I'm really glad to have this opportunity to chat with you today. How are you doing? Is there anything specific on your mind that you'd like to talk about, or would you like to start by telling me a little about yourself?"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2105,"I have been sick for the last five days but, getting better. Nothing really specific that i can think of I am 59 years old, married, 2 grown children and 2 beautiful grand daughters"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2106,"I'm really sorry to hear you've been under the weather, but it's great that you're starting to feel better. It sounds like you have a lovely family surrounding you, with the joy of grandchildren as well. How do you usually find that your health impacts your daily life, especially with the activities you enjoy with your granddaughters and family?"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2107,"My health does effect my life, I have diabetes 2, had a heart attack 2 years ago with 3 stents, neuropathy , also had breast cancer a few years ago"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2108,"You've really been through quite a lot with your health. Managing diabetes, recovering from a heart attack with stents, coping with neuropathy, and going through breast cancer treatment are significant challenges. How have you been handling everything, and how does it all fit into your daily life and routines with your family?"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2109,"I have hardly any energy, tired, it is really tough doing things with family and very hard to do chores"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2110,"That sounds incredibly tough, especially when you want to be active and engaged with your family. It's understandable that feeling tired and having low energy would make everyday activities and chores more challenging. How does smoking fit into your life within this context, especially with the health challenges you've described?"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2111,"It calms my nerves but, know that if I keep smoking my life be shortened"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2112,"It's understandable that smoking can feel like a way to calm your nerves, especially when dealing with so many health-related stressors. At the same time, you recognize the impact it could have on your life expectancy. How does it feel to think about the connection between smoking for relief and the potential risks to your health?"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2113,It is scary
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2114,I can imagine it's pretty unsettling to think about those risks and what they might mean for your future. It sounds like you're really caught in a tough spot—wanting that calm feeling but also being concerned about the implications for your health. How do you see yourself balancing these feelings and making decisions about smoking in the context of your life and family?
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2115,i am not sure if I will stop smoking soon
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2116,"It's completely okay to feel uncertain about making changes, especially with something as complex as smoking. You're in the process of weighing these important factors, and that's a significant step on its own. Is there anything more you'd like to understand or explore about smoking and your health, or any particular questions you have in mind around making changes?"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2117,Not at this time
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,counsellor,2118,"Thank you for sharing with me today; I really appreciate it. Let me summarize our conversation. You've been dealing with significant health challenges like diabetes, a past heart attack, neuropathy, and breast cancer, which have left you feeling tired and low on energy. This affects your daily activities and time with your family. Smoking, for you, is a way to calm your nerves, but you're also understandably concerned about how it might impact your health and life expectancy. Right now, you’re contemplating these feelings and how they fit into your life decisions. If there's anything more you'd like to talk about in the future, I'm here to explore it with you. Take care, and I hope you continue to feel better.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
73,568e7e33e3ef9e000da202a7,client,2119,No
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2120,Hello! It's great to meet you. I hope you're having a good day. How are you feeling as we start our session today?
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2121,"I'm feeling well, thank you for asking"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2122,"I'm glad to hear that you're feeling well. I appreciate you taking the time to be here today. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on, or are you open to exploring your thoughts and feelings around smoking?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2123,it's your boat captain
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2124,Thank you for sharing that with me. I'm here to support you in navigating any thoughts or feelings you might have about smoking. Would you like to start by sharing a bit about what smoking means in your life and what roles it plays?
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2125,"it plays the role of stress mitigator mainly and I also tend to smoke after I partake in marijuana medicinally, of course"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2126,Smoking seems to offer you some relief from stress and serves as a complementary habit when you use marijuana medicinally. How do you feel about these roles smoking is playing in your life? Are there parts of it that you find beneficial or perhaps some aspects that you find challenging?
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2127,I have to say that I don't feel one way or the other about it it's smoking I do it. I know it's not particularly healthy for me but then again what is in today's world?
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2128,"It sounds like smoking is a part of your routine that doesn't evoke strong feelings either way. While you're aware of its health implications, you've also accepted it as something you do. I wonder if there are aspects of smoking that you're curious about exploring further, perhaps related to your health or how it fits into your overall lifestyle?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2129,"Overall lifestyle, I mean it's their day in and day out throughout the day, much like hydration on the other hand, I don't have any health issues so not much to be concerned about there"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2130,"Smoking seems to be woven into the fabric of your daily habits, much like something as basic as staying hydrated. It's a consistent presence without any apparent immediate health issues. Would you be interested in discussing more about how smoking fits into your day-to-day life and any thoughts or feelings that might come up around its role in your routine?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2131,"I mean, not really if you could come up with some other association to make that would be beneficial"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2132,"I appreciate your honesty, and I'm here to support you in whatever way feels most beneficial for you. It sounds like smoking is very integrated into your life right now. What do you think it would be like if smoking changed in some way, or if there was another way to address what smoking currently provides?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2133,"Well, I was in a situation in the past where I was unable to smoke from us two years, so I think about that ofte"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2134,"It seems like that period when you weren't smoking left an impression on you, and it crosses your mind often. Can you tell me more about what that time was like for you and how you felt, both during and after those two years?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2135,"well it wasn't by choice, I was incarcerated so suffice to say when the choice is removed from your control, things get quite a bit easier"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2136,"It sounds like having the choice removed made it more straightforward for you to stop smoking at that time. Being incarcerated must have presented its own challenges, but you managed to get through those years without smoking. Reflecting on that experience, what, if anything, do you think you learned about yourself or your relationship with smoking?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2137,"that is more or less a crutch, but in the grand scheme of things, it's better than other crutches that I've used to deal with stress"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2138,"You've recognized that smoking acts as a crutch for managing stress, and you see it as a preferable option compared to other methods you've used in the past. That awareness offers a lot of insight into how smoking fits into your life. How do you feel about this realization, and is there anything you might want to explore regarding other ways to manage stress?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2139,"I feel grateful for the realisation, just like every other realisation I've come to in my 36 years of existence because when you come to realisation, it's the result of an experience"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2140,"It sounds like you have a deep appreciation for the insights that come from life's experiences, each leading to valuable realizations. This particular awareness about smoking being a crutch seems to have shaped your understanding of stress management. How do you envision the future with this knowledge, especially in terms of how you approach stress or other aspects of your life?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2141,I am vision the future as fluid when the time comes that I decide to quit I'll quit
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2142,"You see the future as fluid, trusting that when you decide it's time to quit, you'll be ready to make that change. It's reassuring to know that you have confidence in your ability to act when the moment feels right. Is there anything else you'd like to explore today, or any other thoughts or plans that come to mind about your relationship with smoking?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2143,"no, I think we've made great progress in the exploration that was made today. Thank you"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,counsellor,2144,"Thank you for the conversation today. I'll summarize what we've discussed to bring things to a close. We talked about how smoking serves as a stress relief for you and complements your medicinal marijuana use. You shared that smoking is a consistent part of your routine and that, while you're aware of the health implications, it doesn't evoke strong feelings. We explored your past experience of not smoking for two years during a time when you didn't have a choice, which helped you understand that smoking is a crutch for stress management. You're grateful for this realization and see the future as fluid, with confidence that you'll quit smoking when you decide it's time. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss, feel free to reach out again. Thank you for your openness today.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
74,646ff124ef129159bf5f08f7,client,2145,No
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2146,Hello there! How are you doing today? I'm really glad we've got the chance to chat. How's your day been so far?
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2147,Its been good i have been productive so far
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2148,It's great to hear that you've been having a productive day! Achieving things can feel really good. Is there anything specific you were focusing on or are proud about today?
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2149,i was focusing on working on a database i created for a bot i'm working on. cleaning up and adding data. How was your day so far?
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2150,"That sounds interesting, working on a database for a bot! It must feel rewarding to see your progress as you clean up and add data. As for my day, it's been fulfilling getting to talk with people like you and help them explore their thoughts and goals. Speaking of goals, would you like to share a bit about what brings you here today?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2151,I'm here today to discuss my goals of stopping smoking
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2152,"Thanks for sharing that with me. It's a big step to even think about quitting smoking, and it shows you're considering some changes in your life. I’d love to hear more about what makes you think about stopping and what your thoughts are about smoking right now."
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2153,Well I went to the doctor recently because of a bad cold and got scary results I guess and I should probably stop smoking
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2154,"It sounds like your recent visit to the doctor left a strong impression on you, especially with the results you received. It must be unsettling to hear anything concerning about your health. What are some of the thoughts and feelings you have as you consider the idea of stopping smoking?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2155,"Well, when I asked for a nicotine patch they said i needed to get a referral from my pcp. But that I had no pcp. So i need to set one up. So I attempted to do so but they said none are avaialble"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2156,"It sounds like you've been trying to take steps towards quitting by seeking out a nicotine patch, but you've run into some roadblocks with the healthcare system. That must be incredibly frustrating, especially when you're motivated to make a change. It's great, though, that you're actively looking for a way forward. How do you feel about the different options you might have for support or alternatives in working toward quitting smoking?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2157,Yes but no pcp is available at the moment I will need to go on a waiting list. which makes it difficult to start the steps i need.
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2158,"It must be really discouraging to feel ready to make this change and run into such delays and barriers. It takes a lot of patience and persistence to deal with such obstacles. Until you can connect with a primary care provider, what are some other ways you think might be helpful in managing your goals around quitting smoking? Perhaps there are other resources or strategies you're considering in the meantime?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2159,attempting to smoke less and remind myself why. having will power
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2160,You're focusing on reducing the amount you smoke and staying mindful of your reasons for wanting to quit. Relying on your willpower and reminding yourself of your motivations can be powerful tools. It shows your commitment to making this change. What are some of the reasons that help you stay motivated or remind you why you want to cut back on smoking?
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2161,mainly my son and future goals
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2162,Your son and your future goals are deeply meaningful motivations to you. Prioritizing your health and well-being for the sake of your son and the future you've envisioned for yourself is a powerful driving force. How does thinking about these motivators impact your resolve and approach towards smoking less?
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2163,it motivates me a lot. though it hasnt stopped me from smoking still
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2164,"Your son and your aspirations for the future fuel your motivation significantly, even if you're still smoking. It's entirely natural to have these strong motivators and yet find it challenging to stop smoking altogether. This is a complex process. What do you think might help further harness that motivation to support your efforts?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2165,probably going on a nicotine patch as i have been smoking for a while
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2166,"The idea of using a nicotine patch as a tool seems like a practical way to support your goal, considering how long you've been smoking. It's great that you've identified a method that aligns with your motivation to change. Until you can access the patch, are there any other small steps or strategies you've thought about that could help you maintain your motivation and gradually reduce smoking?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2167,none really as i enjoy smoking it helps me concentrate and maybe is associated with many actions for me
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2168,"You find smoking to be a source of enjoyment and concentration, and it seems tied to many aspects of your daily life. It's understandable that it's challenging to move away from something that's so integrated into your routines. Balancing the positives you perceive from smoking with your motivations to quit is a big part of what you're working through. What do you think it might be like to try finding some alternatives or new routines that could support your concentration or enjoyment in ways that align with your goals?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2169,i am ok concentrating without them it is just a long established habit so i need to test myself and extend the time i go without them and build on that until i can decrease successfully
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2170,"You've got a clear plan in mind by testing and gradually extending the time between cigarettes. Working to shift a habit that's been part of your life for so long takes patience and persistence, and you've already begun to think about how to tackle it incrementally. It sounds like you're determined to find balance and create a new pattern. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or discuss today as you think about this journey?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2171,at this time i am ok ty
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,counsellor,2172,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. Let's go over what we've talked about so far. You've been considering quitting smoking, especially after receiving some concerning health results from your recent doctor's visit. Despite some frustrations with accessing the nicotine patch due to healthcare hurdles, you've shown great determination. Your son and future goals serve as strong motivators for wanting to make this change, and you're already thinking of practical steps like gradually extending the time between cigarettes. You've recognized the role smoking plays in your routine, yet you're committed to finding new patterns that support your goals. It's clear you're motivated and thinking deeply about how to move forward. Thanks again for our conversation.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
75,6574890e515887ae3dd1a434,client,2173,No
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2174,"Hello there! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about having this session, and is there anything specific on your mind that you'd like to share?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2175,"There isnt anything specfic, is there anything you would like to ask"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2176,"Thanks for that. Well, since we're starting off, it might be helpful to talk a little bit about your experience with smoking. When it comes to your smoking habits, what has that been like for you?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2177,Its been very much worse when i get stressed which has increased it recently
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2178,"It seems that stress has been playing a big role in your smoking recently, making it harder to manage. How does smoking fit into your life when you're dealing with stress?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2179,I do it basically whenever i am stressed
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2180,"Smoking seems to serve as a way to cope with stress for you. It seems like it might be a familiar way to find some relief, even if it's just temporary. How do you feel about using smoking in that way to handle stress?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2181,it makes me very upset as i dont want to be doing this
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2182,It sounds like there's a part of you that's really unhappy about relying on smoking to deal with stress. You're recognizing that it's not something you want for yourself. What concerns you most about continuing to smoke when you're stressed?
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2183,its making my health a lot worse
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2184,The impact on your health is really concerning for you. It seems like you’re recognizing that smoking is affecting your well-being in ways that you don't want. How do you envision things being different if you weren't relying on smoking during stressful times?
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2185,i think it would improve my heath a lot
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2186,Imagining a healthier future sounds motivating. It seems you're envisioning a positive change that would help to improve your overall well-being. What do you think this kind of change would mean for you personally?
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2187,it would make me feel like less of a burdon for affecting my health knowlingly
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2188,"Feeling like a burden because of knowingly affecting your health seems to be quite a heavy weight to carry. You're thinking that without smoking, you might experience a sense of relief and perhaps self-empowerment. Is there anything else related to smoking and change that you'd like to explore today?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2189,Not that i can think og
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2190,"Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. We've touched on some important aspects of your experience with smoking, like its connection to stress and your concerns about health and feeling like a burden. Would you like to talk about some potential next steps or plans for moving forward with your goal of improving your health?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2191,Yes please
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2192,"Great! Before we dive into planning, let's review what we've discussed. You've shared that smoking has become a way to cope with stress, but it's also something you're unhappy with because of its impact on your health and feeling like a burden. You're envisioning a healthier future without smoking. Would it be alright if we explore some steps that might help you move towards that goal?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2193,Yes please
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2194,"Thank you for being open to exploring this. Since stress plays a key role in your smoking, one step might be to consider alternative ways to manage stress. This could involve looking into relaxation techniques or activities that help you feel more at ease. What are your thoughts on trying something new to handle stress, perhaps a hobby or relaxation practice?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2195,i think that a relaxation prcatice would be good
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2196,"That sounds like a promising direction. Choosing a relaxation practice that's appealing to you could make a meaningful difference. Some people find practices like deep breathing, meditation, or gentle exercise helpful. Is there a specific relaxation technique that you're curious about or would like to try first?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2197,Can you give me some suggestions
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2198,"Of course! Here are a few relaxation techniques you might consider:

1. **Deep Breathing:** Focus on slowly inhaling through your nose, holding your breath for a moment, and then exhaling through your mouth. This can help calm your mind and body.

2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This involves slowly tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head.

3. **Mindfulness Meditation:** Spend a few minutes sitting quietly, focusing on your breath, the sensations in your body, or the environment around you. This practice can help bring present-moment awareness.

4. **Guided Imagery:** Picture a calming scene or a place where you feel at peace. Guiding your mind to this image can provide relief from stress.

5. **Gentle Stretching or Yoga:** Simple stretches or yoga poses that you can do at home can help reduce tension and improve your mood.

Which of these resonates with you or seems like something you'd be interested in trying?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2199,5
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2200,"Yoga or gentle stretching could be a great way to relieve stress and tension in your body. It's wonderful because it combines movement with mindfulness, giving you both physical and mental benefits. Do you have any experience with yoga or stretching, or would you like some suggestions on how to get started?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2201,i have some experiene
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2202,That's great to hear! Having some experience can help make it easier to incorporate yoga or stretching into your routine. Sometimes just setting aside a few minutes each day for a short session can make a big difference. How do you feel about setting a goal to include this practice regularly to help manage stress?
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2203,i think it makes me feel positive about it
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2204,Feeling positive about incorporating yoga or stretching into your life is a great starting point. Creating a routine that supports your well-being and helps manage stress in a healthier way can be empowering. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or any support you might need as you begin this new approach?
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2205,nothing as far as i can think
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,counsellor,2206,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let’s go over what we’ve talked about. We explored how stress plays a big role in your smoking habits and how that’s been difficult for you, especially with the impact on your health. You expressed concerns about feeling like a burden and the desire for a healthier future without smoking. We delved into possible ways to cope with stress differently, and you expressed interest in incorporating yoga or gentle stretching as a relaxation practice. It’s encouraging to see how positive you feel about taking this step toward improving your well-being. If more comes to mind that you’d like to discuss, we can explore it further next time.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
76,665cc3df1329066906fba1ad,client,2207,No
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2208,Hello! It's great to meet you. How has your day been going so far?
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2209,great
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2210,I'm glad to hear that! Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to explore in our time together today?
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2211,I have given up smoking before and would like to again but i don't know when
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2212,"It's great that you're thinking about giving up smoking again. It sounds like you've had some experience with quitting in the past, and that could offer some valuable insights into what might work for you this time. What makes you think about stopping now, and what are some of the things you've learned from your past experiences?"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2213,Money is the main reason to give up again. I gave up for about 2 or 3 years and didn't miss it at all. The first 3 or so weeks were hard but then after that it was easy. The hardest part is getting in
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2214,"Saving money can be a compelling reason to consider quitting again, especially since you know from your previous experience that once those initial weeks passed, it became easier for you. It sounds like you really succeeded in managing it before. What do you think might help you tackle those first challenging weeks this time around?"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2215,Getting in to the right mindset to give up is the main obstacle. It never feels like the right time. I had a strategy of replacing each cigarette with a sweet that seemed to work.
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2216,"Getting into the right mindset can be a tricky obstacle, especially when it never seems like the perfect time. It's interesting that replacing cigarettes with sweets worked for you in the past. That shows a creative way to tackle cravings. What could potentially help you feel ready this time around?"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2217,I don't know. Before it took about 3 failed attempts before I was successful at giving up on the fourth
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2218,"It sounds like you showed a lot of determination, trying multiple times before it finally clicked for you. Each attempt likely taught you something valuable. Is there anything from those past experiences that you feel could be helpful as you think about making this change again?"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2219,"Yes, patches, nicotine gum and medication didn't work. The only thing that worked was sheer willpower. The other things act as a crutch and then once their gone you just start smoking again"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2220,"Relying on your own determination really seemed to be key for you, and it's impressive that sheer willpower was what ultimately carried you through. It might be worth considering what helped strengthen your willpower before and how you can tap into that again. What do you think might rekindle that motivation for you this time?"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2221,I was completely out of money and decided i had to give up if I wanted to have some money to do fun things
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2222,"Running out of money and wanting to enjoy life to the fullest really pushed you to make that change. It seems like having a clear goal, like being able to do fun activities, made a big difference for you. Do you have any dreams or goals now that could inspire you the same way?"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2223,"yes, I can think of some and i guess they would be good motivators. But again it's knowing when is the right time to stop. I haven't been thinking about it seriously recently."
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2224,It's understandable that you're looking for the right time to make such a significant change. Those dreams and goals could be powerful motivators when you're ready to focus on them. Sometimes exploring and talking about those goals can shine a light on that readiness. Is there any other aspect of stopping smoking or your life that you feel is important to explore today?
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2225,No I think that's about all
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,counsellor,2226,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let me summarize what we've explored. You mentioned wanting to quit smoking again primarily due to financial reasons and the desire to enjoy life. You've successfully quit before, relying on sheer willpower, especially when motivated by the opportunity to do fun things with the money you saved. We talked about how getting into the right mindset is difficult, but having clear goals or motivators can be powerful. You also reflected on the challenges with finding the right time to stop. It's been a supportive discussion in reflecting on what has worked for you and what matters most in considering change. If you ever want to talk further about this or explore other strategies, feel free to reach out.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
77,5bec8053b6b5ab00017c7349,client,2227,No
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2228,Hello there! Thanks for being here today. How are you doing today?
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2229,okay
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2230,I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything particular on your mind today that you'd like to talk about?
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2231,no
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2232,"That's perfectly fine. We can take things at your pace. When it comes to smoking, how are things for you currently?"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2233,okay
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2234,"It sounds like smoking is a part of your life right now. What are some things you like about smoking, and perhaps some things you don't like so much?"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2235,"i like the taste, it relaxes me. I don't like the cost"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2236,"You're finding enjoyment in the taste and the relaxation it brings, while at the same time you're feeling the burden of the cost. Balancing those feelings can be challenging. How do these different aspects affect your daily life?"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2237,they don't
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2238,"It sounds like you feel that smoking doesn't have a big impact on your daily routine, except for the financial cost. Has there been a particular moment or event that made you stop and think about your smoking habits recently?"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2239,no there hasn't
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2240,"Okay, that's totally understandable. It’s great that you’re reflecting on it now. When you think about the reasons you smoke and the reasons you'd consider cutting back, what comes to mind?"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2241,nothing really
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2242,"Thank you for being open about how you're feeling. It's all right if nothing specific comes to mind right now. Sometimes it takes time to really explore these thoughts. If you ever feel ready to delve more into these reasons or any other feelings about smoking, I'm here to support you. Is there anything else you'd like to touch upon or discuss at this moment?"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2243,no
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,counsellor,2244,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about. You shared how smoking brings you enjoyment through taste and relaxation, though the financial cost is a concern for you. While smoking currently doesn’t seem to impact your daily life significantly, it is something you’re beginning to reflect on. If you ever wish to discuss your thoughts or explore this more, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
78,6565f3239d4b3557933760d3,client,2245,No
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2246,Hello! It's great to meet you today. How are you feeling as we start this session? Anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about first?
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2247,I'm feeling pretty good.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2248,"That's great to hear! Is there anything specific contributing to that feeling, or anything you'd like to explore together today?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2249,It's Saturday and one of my days off so that's nice
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2250,Having a day to relax can definitely feel refreshing. How do you usually like to spend your days off?
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2251,Usually spend some time on my hobbies.  I'll go to the shooting range later this afternoon and then tonight I got plans with my gaming group.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2252,"That sounds like a fun and fulfilling way to spend your day. It's great to have activities that bring you joy. While you're here today, are there any thoughts or feelings about smoking that you might want to discuss?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2253,"Even though I only smoke 4 cigarettes a day and in the evening, I'd really like to finally kick the habit.  A pack of cigarettes is also only going up in price and is expensive."
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2254,"It sounds like you're really considering the impact smoking has on both your life and your wallet. You're smoking a small amount, but it seems like there's a part of you that is motivated to make a change. What's the most important reason for you wanting to quit right now?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2255,It just seems like a stupid habit at this point.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2256,You've reached a point where smoking doesn't align with what you want for yourself anymore. It sounds like you're ready to explore life without it. What do you think keeps you smoking those four cigarettes in the evening?
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2257,It's a habit I've had for years.  And I do enjoy them.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2258,"It's part of a routine you've had for a long time, and there's a real sense of enjoyment tied to it. Balancing that enjoyment with your desire to quit can be tough. How do you imagine your evenings might be different without those cigarettes?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2259,It will definitely be strange at first as my smoking routine is pretty regimented.  I'm also exploring the possible of getting a nicotine vape pen to ease the transition.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2260,"Moving away from a long-time habit like your smoking routine can indeed feel strange initially. You're thinking about a nicotine vape pen as a way to ease into this change, which shows you're proactively considering how to make the transition smoother. What do you hope to achieve or feel by trying the vape pen as part of your journey?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2261,I think it will make it easier because my body is probably used to getting the shot of nicotine in the evening.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2262,"You're mindful of how your body might crave that nicotine in the evenings, and using a vape pen could help manage that transition by offering a similar experience. It sounds like you're really thinking through how to make this change in a way that's manageable for you. Is there anything else about this transition, or any concerns you have, that you'd like to explore further today?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2263,Do you have any advice on quitting?
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2264,"I can definitely share some ideas that might help. Before I do that, is there anything else specific you're curious about or want to talk about regarding quitting?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2265,"No, I think we covered it."
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2266,"Great, let's summarize what we've talked about. You've been considering quitting smoking because it feels like an outdated habit and the cost of cigarettes is rising. You're already smoking a smaller amount, but you're ready to explore a life without it and are considering using a nicotine vape pen as part of the transition to manage cravings. Would it be alright if we discussed some strategies that could support you in your journey to quit smoking?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2267,Definitely
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2268,"Thank you for allowing me to share some ideas. Here are a few strategies that others have found helpful in their journey to quit smoking:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Consider what typically prompts you to smoke. Whether it's stress or routine, knowing your triggers can help you plan for those moments.

2. **Set Small Goals**: It's often helpful to start small. You might set a goal to reduce the number of cigarettes gradually or have smoke-free days.

3. **Create New Routines**: Think about filling the time you usually spend smoking with activities you enjoy, like your gaming or shooting. 

4. **Support System**: Lean on friends, family, or groups who can support you in this journey. 

5. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself during this process. Every step you take, big or small, is progress.

Let me know if any of these resonate with you or if there's anything specific you'd like to focus on!"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2269,Cutting back at first sounds like a good idea.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2270,Cutting back gradually can make the change feel more manageable and less overwhelming. It's a way to ease into the transition while adapting to a new routine. How does that sound as a starting point for you? Are there any specific ways you'd like to begin reducing the amount you smoke?
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2271,I think I will start with skipping my first cigarette of the evening.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2272,That sounds like a solid and achievable starting point. Skipping your first cigarette of the evening can help you gradually adjust and gain confidence in this process. How do you feel about beginning with this change? Is there anything you might need to support yourself in taking this step?
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2273,I'm lucky to have a supportive family who also want to see me quit.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2274,"Having a supportive family can make a significant difference. Their encouragement and understanding can provide you with an extra boost along the way. It's wonderful to know you have that support around you. Is there any way you'd like to involve them as you start on this journey, or anything specific they could do to help?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2275,"I don't think so, just knowing they're rooting for me is enough."
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2276,"Having their encouragement can be so empowering. Just knowing they're in your corner can be a great source of strength. You're taking a positive step forward by deciding to skip that first cigarette. If you have any thoughts or need any support as you go through this, I'm here to chat anytime. What's your next action to take this plan forward?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2277,I'm going to try starting with tonight and see how it goes.
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2278,"That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Giving it a try tonight is a great first step. Remember that it's a process, and any effort towards your goal is progress. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss your experience or need any support along the way. You've got this!"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2279,"Thanks MIBot, you're the best!!"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,counsellor,2280,"Thank you for our conversation today! Let's go over what we've talked about: You mentioned that you smoke about four cigarettes a day and you're eager to quit because it feels like a habit you're ready to move past. We discussed the cost aspect too. You're considering a vape pen to help ease you through the transition, recognizing how your body may still crave that evening nicotine. We talked about gradual changes, and you decided to start by skipping the first cigarette tonight, with the support of your family cheering you on. I'm glad we could explore these thoughts together, and I appreciate your openness in sharing. Feel free to reach out anytime as you continue on this journey.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
79,6605c7d99fbe34468c431d43,client,2281,No
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2282,Hello and welcome. How are you feeling today? Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to start with?
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2283,No. Not really.  I've just woken up and am starting the day with coffee and toast
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2284,That's a nice way to start the day. How are mornings usually for you? Do you have a routine that you follow?
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2285,I have breakfast while I do wordle and read the news.  Then shit/shower/shave and start the day.
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2286,"That sounds like a well-structured morning routine. I'm curious, does smoking fit into your morning at all, or is it something that comes up later in the day for you?"
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2287,I don't even think about a cigarette until the sun goes down at the end of the day
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2288,It's interesting that you have that clear boundary between day and night for smoking. What do you think makes evenings the time when you reach for a cigarette?
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2289,I think it's something to do with being busy during the day.  I never smoke in the house so it's also a hassle.  At night you can enjoy the cooler air and watch the stars and think about things.
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2290,"There's a certain peace and relaxation that comes in the evening, and having a cigarette seems to be a part of that process for you. It's like a moment to unwind and reflect. What are some of the things you enjoy contemplating during those times?"
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2291,"I often speak with my brother, or friends that come around.  We've recently agreed we won't speak of Trump again this year but normally we talk on family care, geopolitics, work, cars, Motogp."
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2292,"It sounds like you share meaningful conversations and discussions under the stars, which can be quite enjoyable. How do those evening conversations and the experience of smoking fit together—are they connected for you in some way, or more just coincidental?"
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2293,"Everyone smokes. Or vapes.  It's part of the evening.  Saturday we braai, Wednesday we play cards so sometimes it involves food and beer or wine."
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2294,"Smoking and vaping seem to be woven into these social evenings, almost like a tradition. They are part of the shared experiences with friends and family, whether it’s around a braai or a card game. Have there been moments where you’ve considered how smoking fits into these evenings or thought about what it might be like without it?"
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2295,"Yeah, totally.  I smoked before the social evenings started.  Although they've been going for 25 years and we've lost many friends and neighbours to cancer/covid/old age, the evenings have evolved."
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2296,"You've been through a lot, and those changes in your social circle can really shape how you view things, including smoking. It sounds like you've experienced the evolution of these evenings over time. Has the loss of friends and neighbors ever led you to reflect on your smoking habit and its place in your life?"
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,client,2297,"I think life is going through a lot. And it's a nice journey. But no, the deaths haven't made me consider stopping.  A third neighbour has just said she has cancer and we've just lost Henri and Mario"
80,60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,counsellor,2298,"Thank you for taking the time to chat today. I appreciate your openness and sharing your experiences with me. As we've discussed, your days begin with a structured routine and the evening holds a special place for relaxation and meaningful conversations with your friends and family. Smoking is intertwined with these social evenings and has its own special place under the night sky.

It's clear that these moments offer relaxation and connection, especially when surrounded by loved ones and shared traditions like cards or a braai. You’ve reflected on the losses of friends and neighbors, and while these events haven't led you to consider quitting smoking, they seem to cause deep reflection on life.

It has been nice to hear about your experiences and the way you navigate through life’s journey. If there’s anything more you'd like to explore regarding your relationship with smoking or anything else in future conversations, I'm here to support you. Take care, and I'm looking forward to our next session whenever you're ready."
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2299,"Hi there! It’s nice to meet you. I'm here to listen and explore any thoughts or feelings you might have about smoking. Whenever you’re ready, feel free to share what's on your mind. How's your day going so far?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2300,my day is going good thanks! nice to meet you too!
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2301,"That's great to hear! I'm glad you're having a good day. I'm here to support you in whatever way you need, especially if there are things on your mind related to smoking. Is there anything particular you feel like discussing today?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2302,i find it really hard to stop smoking
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2303,"That sounds challenging, and it's understandable that stopping might feel difficult. Smoking can be quite a complicated habit with many ties to daily life. What do you think makes it hard for you to stop?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2304,I enjoy smoking when I get up in the morning and having a few cups of tea and also when having a drink and it would not be the  same without a smoke
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2305,"Smoking seems to have become an integral part of your routines, especially during certain activities like having tea or a drink. These moments seem to hold a lot of comfort and perhaps enjoyment for you. How does smoking fit into these experiences for you?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2306,it fits into everything about these experiences and it wouldn't be the same without a smoke
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2307,"Smoking appears to weave itself deeply into the fabric of those experiences, adding something meaningful to them. At the same time, it sounds like you're considering stopping, given our conversation. What has made you think about making a change, even though smoking is such a part of those special moments?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2308,I think it is really bad for my health and it has become very expensive to buy tobacco
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2309,You've identified some important concerns: health implications and the financial cost of smoking. It's quite powerful to recognize how these factors impact your life. How do these concerns weigh against the enjoyment you get from smoking during those moments?
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2310,they weigh heavily and it will be very difficult to quit
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2311,"It sounds like you're experiencing a strong tug-of-war between the enjoyment you find in smoking and the significant costs tied to it. Acknowledging this struggle is a crucial step. What do you imagine life might look like if some of those burdens of smoking were lifted, like health or finances?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2312,I would certainly be a lot more healthy and of course I would have more money
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2313,Imagining a life where you feel healthier and have more financial freedom certainly paints a promising picture. It sounds like these outcomes could bring positive changes to your life. What is it about these potential changes that stands out most to you?
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2314,all of them! to be healthy and have more money sounds amazing
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2315,You really seem to value the idea of better health and financial freedom. Seeing how much these changes can offer might be quite inspiring. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about before we think more about how you might achieve these changes?
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2316,i cant think of anything right now
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2317,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. We've discussed how smoking is entwined in your life, the health and financial concerns you have, and the appealing vision of a healthier and more financially stable future. Would you like to explore some options and strategies to move toward the changes you're considering?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2318,yes definetely!
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2319,Great! I appreciate your willingness to explore this further. Would it be okay if we talk about some steps that might help you on this path?
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2320,sure
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2321,"Thank you. Since smoking is currently a comfort in some of your routines, one approach could be to explore small changes in those routines. We can also look at strategies for managing cravings and consider some support resources that could be helpful. Are there any particular areas you'd like to focus on first, or any strategies you've thought about trying?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2322,I think when i wake i could leave the house and do some exercise perhaps
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2323,"That sounds like a positive adjustment to your morning routine. Engaging in exercise could provide a fresh start to your day and may even help distract from the urge to smoke. What kind of exercise do you enjoy, or could you see yourself trying in the mornings?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2324,I like to walk fast and also swim
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2325,"Those both sound like great options! Fast walking and swimming can be invigorating and have beneficial effects on both body and mind. Starting your morning with an activity you enjoy might create a new, healthy habit. Do you feel ready to give one of these a try, or is there anything you’d like to plan or think through more?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2326,i think i feel ready to begin with a brisk walk each morning and take it from there
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2327,"That sounds like a wonderful place to start! A brisk walk each morning can be refreshing and could open new perspectives on how you begin your day. Remember, it's about taking it step by step at your own pace. Is there anything you might need to prepare or support yourself as you make this change?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2328,I could also hide all my smoking things before I go to bed so I don't see them first thing in the moring
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2329,"That sounds like a thoughtful tactic. By removing the immediate visual trigger, you’re creating a new environment for your morning routine, which can help make space for your brisk walk instead. It's a step towards breaking the usual habits and setting yourself up for success. Do you feel prepared to start with these changes, or is there any other support that might be helpful for you?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2330,i feel like i am prepared to make a start
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2331,"It's very encouraging to hear that you feel prepared to begin. You'll be building new routines and discovering what works best for you along the way. Please remember, even small steps forward are progress, and it's normal to have ups and downs on this journey. Would you like to plan a follow-up session to talk about how things are going, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up for today?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2332,i think everything is covered so far! and it has been great advice and help so far
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,counsellor,2333,"Thank you for the conversation today. It’s been a pleasure talking with you. To summarize, you shared that while smoking is a part of your daily routine, especially during your morning tea or drinks, you're feeling the weight of concerns about your health and finances. We explored the idea of change and how a healthier lifestyle with more financial freedom sounds appealing to you. You expressed interest in starting a brisk morning walk to shift your routine and considered the idea of removing smoking triggers. It sounds like you're prepared to begin this journey toward change at your own pace. I'm glad to hear you found our discussion helpful, and I'm here to support you as you take these steps forward. Please feel free to reach out anytime.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
81,57e7b82b21d77800018e51fe,client,2334,No
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2335,"Hello there! How are you doing today? I'm glad you decided to spend some time with me. We can chat about anything that's on your mind. Is there something specific you wanted to explore in our time together, or would you like to start more casually today?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2336,I'd like some advice on ways to try reduce my smoking?
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2337,"I really appreciate your openness in seeking out ways to reduce smoking. Cutting back on smoking is quite an important step, and can definitely lead to feeling healthier and more energetic. Before jumping into strategies, would you be willing to share a bit about your smoking habits and what your thoughts and experiences around smoking have been like? This might help us tailor any advice to your own journey."
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2338,I started smoking at 15 years old and have tried to quit one time a long time ago and was unsuccessful. I suffer with severe anxiety and without a roll up it's way harder to deal with it.
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2339,"Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like smoking has been a part of your life for quite a while, and it seems like it's connected to managing your anxiety. At the same time, you seem to have an interest in cutting back or quitting. Balancing the relief smoking provides with the desire for change can be tough. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in your anxiety and your life as a whole now?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2340,I feel like I need some other coping mechanisms instead of smoking. My chest and health is worse as well and this worries me.
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2341,"It's concerning that your health is being affected, and it's meaningful that you're considering finding other ways to cope with anxiety that don't involve smoking. It's clear that you care about your well-being and are looking for positive changes. Are there any particular coping mechanisms you've thought about or tried in the past? Or perhaps activities or interests you might want to explore further?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2342,"I've tried the elastic band on my wrist so when I get a craving, I ping it. But unfortunately that doesn't work. Do u have any other ideas?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2343,"It's great that you've experimented with strategies like the elastic band; it shows your willingness to try different things. There are certainly many approaches that people find helpful, and we can explore a variety to see what might fit you best. Would you be open to discussing mindfulness exercises or perhaps physical activities that could help with anxiety and provide a different kind of relief?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2344,Yes a few mindfulness activities please.
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2345,"That's wonderful to hear. One approach involves deep breathing exercises, which can be done anywhere and help calm your mind and body. For example, you could try taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose, holding the breath for a moment, and then slowly exhaling through your mouth. Repeating this several times can be quite soothing. Another option is a brief body scan, where you gently focus on each part of your body, noticing any tension and allowing it to relax.

These are just a couple of examples. What do you think about trying either of these techniques? Are there particular ones you feel might fit into your routine?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2346,Yes I can try these. Thank you. I also thought about maybe putting the money I use to buy tobacco I should put it in a jar and save and use it for a car on 3 years time.
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2347,"That's a fantastic idea! Saving the money you would have spent on tobacco and visualizing it going toward something meaningful, like a car, can be quite motivating. It gives a tangible goal to work towards, which can make the process of reducing smoking feel more rewarding. How do you feel about the idea of making this a part of your journey? Does having a goal like this change how you think about the choices you make around smoking?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2348,Yes it keeps me motivated and maybe get a tracking app for number of days or health quote.
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2349,"Tracking apps can be a great tool for staying motivated and seeing your progress. They often provide insights and encouragement along the way, whether it's counting the days or highlighting health accomplishments. You're really thinking through how to support yourself on this path. Is there anything else you would like to talk about or any other ideas you’d like to explore before we go further?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2350,No let's carry on.
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2351,"Great! Let's recap a bit. We've explored the connection between smoking and anxiety, and you've shared your interest in finding alternative coping mechanisms. You're considering mindful breathing, body scans, and tracking your progress with an app. Plus, saving money towards a car is an exciting goal to strive for.

Would it be alright with you if we began to talk about how you might plan for these changes, incorporating the strategies that resonate with you the most?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2352,"Well I'm going to get a jar, stress ball and a fake fag so I have the hand motion sorted out and then give it a go and lots of chewing gum"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2353,"You have come up with a solid practical plan! Having a jar for savings, using a stress ball, a fake cigarette for the hand motion, and chewing gum for oral fixation are all great steps. You seem ready to take action and experiment with these strategies to see what feels right and effective for you. 

How do you feel about planning a start date for these changes, or would you prefer to ease into them naturally?"
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,client,2354,I'd like to plan a day. I suffer with ocd so I need a plan.
82,613dd5fb512aabe8d5d32393,counsellor,2355,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. We've reached the end of our session, so I'll take a moment to summarize everything we've talked about.

You've shared your smoking history and the challenges with anxiety, as well as your desire to explore new coping mechanisms. We discussed mindfulness exercises like deep breathing and body scans, and you considered utilizing a tracking app to monitor your progress. I admired your creative idea of saving the money you'd otherwise spend on tobacco with the goal of purchasing a car.

You're planning to use a jar for savings, a stress ball, a fake cigarette, and gum as supportive tools. Additionally, you expressed the importance of having a structured plan, given your experience with OCD. You're planning to choose a specific start date to begin implementing these changes.

You've considered many strategies that resonate with you, and it's clear you're committed to making positive steps forward. Thank you again for this productive conversation, and if there's anything else you need moving forward, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care."
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2356,Hi there! I'm glad you've joined me today. It's great that you've taken this step. How are you feeling right now?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2357,worn out
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2358,I hear you're feeling worn out. That must be tough to cope with. Is there anything particular that's been making you feel this way?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2359,financial stress
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2360,Managing financial stress can be really draining and overwhelming. You're not alone in feeling this way. I'm here to support you through this. Is smoking something you turn to when you're experiencing stress?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2361,yes always
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2362,It sounds like smoking is a significant way you cope with stress. How do you feel it affects your stress levels in the moment and in the long run?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2363,it helps take the edge off of the stress but I don't like the money I spend on it
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2364,"Smoking provides you with a sense of relief, but at the same time, it adds to the financial stress you're already dealing with. That's quite a conflict. What are some other thoughts you have when you think about the money spent on cigarettes?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2365,I could be spending money on better things
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2366,You see the potential for using that money on things that might bring more value or joy into your life. That seems important to you. How does this thought affect your overall feelings towards smoking?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2367,it makes me feel guilty to keep smoking when I'm so poor
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2368,"The guilt of spending money on cigarettes while dealing with financial difficulties adds another layer of stress for you. This inner conflict sounds challenging and important. What are your thoughts on how you'd like your relationship with smoking to change, if at all?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2369,"I enjoy smoking, I hate being addicted to it and feeling like I need it"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2370,"You enjoy aspects of smoking, but the feeling of being dependent on it isn't something you want. It sounds like there's part of you that values your freedom more than the enjoyment itself. What do you think you'd like to achieve if you could change this aspect of your life?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2371,I could achieve better financial balance
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2372,Achieving better financial balance is something that stands out to you and could provide some much-needed relief. That seems like a motivating goal for you. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today regarding your thoughts and feelings about smoking?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2373,no
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2374,"Thank you for sharing everything with me today. I'll summarize what we've gone over so far. You've been feeling worn out, particularly because of financial stress, and you've recognized that smoking is both a way you cope with stress and a source of further financial strain. There's a conflicting feeling for you, as you enjoy smoking but dislike the dependence it creates and the financial burden it adds. Achieving better financial balance is something that's important and motivating for you. Please know that I'm here to continue supporting you as you navigate these feelings and any changes you might consider in the future.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2375,"Yes, let's continue."
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2376,"Great! Thank you for your openness. Now, with the idea of achieving better financial balance in mind, can we explore what a first small step might look like for you, if you're ready?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2377,yes
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2378,Would it be okay to discuss some possible small steps you might consider? You could share your thoughts on what feels manageable for you right now.
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2379,yes
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2380,"Thank you. One potential step might be keeping track of how much you spend on cigarettes each week. It could help you to have a clearer picture and start recognizing areas to save. What do you think of trying that, or is there another small step that feels more suitable for you?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2381,I spend about $20 a week
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2382,"Knowing that you spend about $20 a week on cigarettes is an important realization. Considering what you’ve shared, it sounds like having this understanding could allow you to think about where those funds could be redirected. Is there something meaningful or enjoyable you might consider using that $20 for instead, as you consider your options?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2383,"food, clothes"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2384,Redirecting that $20 toward essentials like food or clothes could make a positive impact on your financial balance and overall well-being. It shows how much you care about using your resources wisely. Would planning these changes feel like a helpful step for you?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2385,"no, I have quit smoking before and find I am the most successful in quitting when I'm in a low-stress period in my life, and that just isn't possible right now with the economy."
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2386,"You know yourself well, and it's understandable that low-stress periods have been more conducive for you to make changes like quitting smoking. Recognizing the timing that works best for you is important. It sounds like, for now, you may prefer focusing on managing stress in ways that are achievable, considering the current economic challenges. How do you feel about focusing on stress relief techniques to help ease the current burden you're experiencing?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2387,yes
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2388,"Exploring stress relief techniques could be helpful in managing the pressures you're facing. Are there any methods you've tried before that brought you some relief, or is there something new you'd like to explore?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2389,guided meditations can be helpful sometimes
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2390,"Guided meditations are a wonderful way to find some calm amidst the stress. They offer a moment to step back and relax. How do you feel about incorporating this technique more regularly, as a way to support yourself right now?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2391,it's possible
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2392,"Thinking about incorporating guided meditations more regularly seems like a plausible option for you. It's great that you're open to the possibility. Would you like to talk about how you might make this a part of your routine, or is there something else related to stress relief that you'd like to explore further?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2393,I would like to know stress relief options for when I feel like smoking
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2394,"That's a valuable focus, especially if those moments are where the urge to smoke is strongest. Some people find activities like deep breathing exercises, taking a short walk, or even just stepping away for a moment to be beneficial. What are your thoughts on trying one of these options, or is there something specific you have in mind that could work for you in those moments?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2395,I have considered putting my cigarettes away while working so I'm not tempted to chain smoke
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2396,That’s a proactive approach and could create a barrier that helps reduce the temptation to smoke continuously. Having that distance during work might offer you a bit of control over how often you reach for a cigarette. How does that idea feel to you in terms of practicality and giving it a try?
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2397,It feels scary to go a whole work day without nicotine when my work is so stressful
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2398,"It's understandable to feel apprehensive about such a change, especially when work itself is a source of stress. The idea of creating small distances in moments might still be supportive—like setting specific short breaks where you step outside for fresh air, or having a brief distraction that allows you to catch your breath, without necessarily going a whole day. How does something like that sound to you as an initial step?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2399,ok
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2400,"You're open to trying a small step like that, and that's a meaningful way forward. Creating these small, manageable moments could help you maintain some balance during the workday. Remember, each small effort counts in managing stress and habits. If you find it helpful, we can keep exploring this or anything else that might arise. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2401,ok
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2402,"Great, I'm glad you feel comfortable with giving this approach a try. Know that I'm here to support you along the way, and we can adjust things as needed. If you’d like to revisit or discuss anything else about smoking or stress relief in the future, we're here for it. Would you like to schedule another session, or is there anything else on your mind right now?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2403,we can schedule another session
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2404,"That sounds good. I'm looking forward to continuing our conversation and supporting you in any way I can. We'll schedule another session, and in the meantime, please feel free to reach out if anything comes up that you'd like to discuss. Take care until then!"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2405,ok
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2406,"Take care, and we'll connect again soon. Remember, you're not alone on this journey. Reach out anytime. Have a good day!"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2407,thank you
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,counsellor,2408,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. We've talked about the stress you're experiencing, especially due to financial pressures. Smoking helps you cope with stress but also adds to your financial strain, leading to feelings of guilt. You're aware of the impact smoking has on your finances and are motivated to redirect those funds toward necessities. You identified guided meditations as a helpful stress relief technique, and we explored creating small distances from smoking, like putting cigarettes away during work breaks. You're open to trying these steps as means of managing stress. I appreciate your openness, and we’re here to support you as you continue navigating these challenges. Looking forward to our next session!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
83,667cfd0b827314cd6f7027c4,client,2409,No
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2410,Hello there! I'm really glad to have you here today. How are you doing?
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2411,"I am doing well, thank you for asking!"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2412,That's great to hear. I'm glad to be spending this time with you. What brings you in today?
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2413,I would like help on quitting smoking.
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2414,"That's a really important step you're considering. Quitting smoking can be a challenging journey, and it's great that you're open to talking about it. What's been going on in your life that has led you to think about stopping smoking?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2415,"I am getting older now, and not only is it a dirty habit that I have had over 40 years, but it is very unhealthy for me."
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2416,"You've been smoking for quite some time, and you're recognizing how it might be affecting your health and overall quality of life. Growing older is often a good moment to reflect on these things. What are the aspects of smoking that you find most concerning health-wise?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2417,The likelihood of getting cancer or emphysema
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2418,"The risks of cancer and emphysema can certainly be serious concerns, especially as we age. It sounds like you're thinking about the long-term effects on your health. How do these worries impact your daily life or how you feel about smoking right now?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2419,It frightens me to think about it and the effects it would have on my family. I constantly think about quitting but I am finding the motivation needed is lacking.
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2420,"The fear of potential health issues and the impact on your family weighs heavily on you, and the motivation to quit feels elusive right now. It's understandable to feel this tug-of-war within yourself. What would it mean to you and your family if you were able to stop smoking?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2421,It would mean the world to me and my family. I have always been the only smoker in the immediate family and they have been telling me for years how much it matters to them that I smoke.
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2422,"Your family clearly cares about you deeply, and being the only smoker in your immediate family has been significant for everyone. Stopping smoking would be a meaningful change for both you and your loved ones. It sounds like there is a strong support system around you. What do you think might help you find that motivation to move toward quitting?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2423,"The motivation is only part of the problem, the hardest part is the physical habit of picking up and lighting a cigarette, Every time I quit that was the thing that always brought me back"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2424,"The physical habit of reaching for a cigarette feels deeply ingrained, and it's been a challenging cycle to break. It's not just about motivation for you; it's also about changing that long-standing routine. What do you think the first step could be in dealing with that physical habit?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2425,"I don't know, that is probably why I haven't tried to quit in a few years"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2426,"It's understandable to feel uncertain about where to start, especially since you've tried before and faced difficulties. It shows that you're reflecting on past experiences and what hasn't worked for you. Perhaps we can explore together any smaller changes that might feel doable for you right now. Is there an aspect of your routine where you feel you might have the most opportunity to make a small shift?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2427,"I am not sure....I work from home, so I have a lot of idle time and whenever I am not busy, I reach for a cigarette whether I want one or not. Its that habit that makes it so hard."
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2428,"Working from home gives you a lot of idle time, and during those moments, the automatic response is to reach for a cigarette, whether or not you truly desire one. This sounds like a challenging pattern to break, given your environment. As we think about small changes, is there something else you might be interested in trying during those idle moments that could serve as an alternative to reaching for a cigarette?"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2429,I would try anything that would help me break the cycle! Do you have any suggestions?
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2430,It's great to hear that you're open to trying alternatives. Would it be alright if I shared a few suggestions with you?
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,client,2431,"Yes, please"
84,66d804534578af1dec99f245,counsellor,2432,"Thank you so much for spending this time with me today. As we wrap up our conversation, I want to reflect on everything we've talked about. You've shared that smoking has been a part of your life for over 40 years and that concerns about your health, particularly the risks of cancer and emphysema, weigh heavily on your mind. You mentioned how much it would mean to both you and your family if you could stop smoking, especially being the only smoker in your immediate family. 

You spoke about your struggle with the habitual nature of smoking, particularly during idle moments while working from home. We explored the idea of finding alternatives to smoking during these times, and you expressed willingness to try anything that might help break the cycle. I'm really encouraged by your openness to explore new strategies.

Remember, this is a journey, and taking it one step at a time can be very powerful. Whenever you feel ready, we're here to continue supporting you on this path. Thank you again, and take care."
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2433,Hello! It's great to meet you today. How are you feeling as we start our conversation?
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2434,"I'm feeling good. It's the weekend now, so I can't complain"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2435,I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good. Weekends can be a nice break from the usual routine. What's been going on for you lately?
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2436,"Nothing much, just grinding through work. It's stressful, so it's been making me smoke more"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2437,"Work stress can definitely intensify habits like smoking. On one hand, it might offer a brief moment of relief, but on the other, it seems to increase your smoking. How do you feel about the way smoking fits into your life right now?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2438,I feel like it controls my life
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2439,"That sounds overwhelming, and it seems like smoking might be taking more out of you than it gives back. What are the things you value most about being in control of your life?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2440,"I'd just like to be healthier, plus, smoking is extremely expensive"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2441,You're focusing on being healthier and noticing the financial cost that smoking carries. Both of those aspects seem pretty important to you. What changes do you envision in your life if you were to move away from smoking?
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2442,I'd have a lot more money thats for sure
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2443,"The thought of having more money sounds appealing, maybe opening up possibilities for other things you'd like to do or invest in. What else comes to mind when you think about what life without smoking could be like?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2444,"I'd just generally be healthier. Maybe I'd be more inclined to exercise, and eat healthier"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2445,"Imagining a healthier lifestyle, full of exercising and better eating habits seems to be quite motivating for you. It's as if embracing one healthy change, like reducing smoking, could encourage other positive shifts in your life. How do you feel about taking steps toward this healthier version of yourself?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2446,I feel negative about it - I've never been a strong willed individual
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2447,"It sounds like you have concerns about your ability to make changes, which is completely understandable. Many people worry about whether they'll be able to follow through. What have you done in the past that required effort and determination, even if it wasn't easy?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2448,"I managed to cut down my alcohol consumption by a lot, which was difficult"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2449,"That's a significant accomplishment, showing that you possess the determination and capability to make meaningful changes when needed. What do you think helped you succeed in cutting down on alcohol? Could any of those strategies support you in reducing smoking?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2450,"I was putting on a lot of weight, and I knew alcohol was causing it"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2451,"You had a clear reason and motivation to cut down on alcohol, recognizing its impact on your weight. Having a tangible goal perhaps gave you the drive you needed. Are there specific motivations or goals around your health or lifestyle that might similarly propel you to address smoking?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2452,"The only motivation currently, is just the financial aspect of it. I spend around £200 a month on cigarettes"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2453,"The financial cost is a substantial motivator for you, given how significant the expense is over time. It's as though reclaiming that money could create opportunities for other priorities or desires. Is there something specific you'd like to do with that money if it wasn't being spent on cigarettes?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2454,I'd probably just save it
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2455,"Putting that money into savings could provide a sense of security or allow you to pursue something meaningful in the future. It feels like building a safety net or making possibilities more attainable is something valuable to you. With these financial and health motivations in mind, how do you feel about exploring some steps toward reducing smoking?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2456,I'd quite like to explore some steps
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2457,"Great to hear you're open to exploring steps toward change. Before we dive into planning, is there anything else you'd like to talk about? If not, I can summarize what we've discussed, and then we could see what comes next."
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2458,That's it
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2459,"Thank you for the conversation today. Let's go over what we've discussed. You shared that work stress has been affecting your smoking habits, leading you to feel somewhat controlled by it. We talked about the importance of health to you, the desire for more financial freedom, and your admirable effort to reduce alcohol consumption in the past. You connected the financial burden of smoking with the potential of saving money for future security. You expressed openness to exploring steps toward reducing smoking, considering these motivations. I'm glad we're exploring ways to support the positive changes you want to make. 

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2460,"Yes, let's continue."
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2461,Wonderful. May I have your permission to discuss some potential steps and ideas for reducing smoking? We can consider what might fit best with your lifestyle and goals.
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2462,Yes please
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2463,"Thank you. Let's look at a few small steps you might consider, and you can tell me what resonates with you.

1. **Timing**: Identify certain times or situations when you typically smoke and see if those might be times to focus on reducing or delaying smoking.

2. **Alternative Activities**: Try replacing smoking with a different activity you enjoy or find relaxing, to address stress or boredom without reaching for a cigarette.

3. **Mindful Spending**: Think about putting aside the money you would have spent on cigarettes into a savings jar, and watching it grow.

4. **Support System**: Consider reaching out to friends, family, or support groups to have encouragement and accountability as you make changes.

5. **Gradual Reduction**: Plan to cut down a specific number of cigarettes each day or week, leading to gradual reduction.

Which, if any, of these ideas or any others you might have feel like a good starting point?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2464,I think number 5 would be best
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2465,"Starting with a gradual reduction can be a practical and manageable approach, allowing you to slowly ease into the change without feeling overwhelmed. Is there a specific number of cigarettes you think you might want to start cutting back on each day or week to begin this process?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2466,"Maybe just reducing the number by 1 each week, rather than trying to go too extreme"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2467,"Reducing by one each week is a thoughtful and steady way to approach this, giving you time to adjust and focus on each small step. It's all about balancing progress with what's manageable for you. How do you feel about starting with this approach, and is there any support or resource you'd like as you begin?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2468,"I think there's any specific support or resource that'd help for this, I'd just have to kind of push myself for it"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2469,"Having the mindset to push yourself and knowing what's manageable for you is powerful. As you go through this process, remember that I'm here to support you, whether it's talking through challenges or celebrating victories. How about we check in on this again next time we meet to see how you’re feeling and what’s working or needs adjustment?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2470,"Yeah that sounds good. I'll see by this time next week, if instead of smoking 15 a day, I've managed to cut it down to 14 a day, and then carry on doing that weekly"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2471,"That sounds like a solid and thoughtful plan. Taking it one step at a time, with a focus on weekly progress, can make a world of difference. I'll be here to support you with any reflections or new challenges that might come up as you work toward your goal. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Until then, take care and remember to acknowledge the effort you're putting into this!"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2472,Thank you!
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2473,"You're welcome! I'm here to support you, and I'm glad we had this conversation. Wishing you a positive and healthy start to your journey this week. Take care, and see you next time!"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2474,Goodbye! - Close the conversation
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,counsellor,2475,"Thank you for the conversation today. To summarize our discussion: You shared that work stress has been influencing your smoking habits and leading to feelings of being controlled by it. You expressed a strong desire to improve your health and manage your finances better, recognizing the significant cost of smoking. You also mentioned your success in reducing alcohol consumption in the past, which highlights your capacity for change. Together, we explored the idea of gradually reducing your smoking by one cigarette each week, which feels like a manageable starting point for you. You've set a personal goal to check in on this progress by our next meeting. I'm here for support, and I look forward to seeing how things evolve for you. Take care until next time!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
85,65dde97292c3b8d0e4fa00d7,client,2476,No
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2477,Hi there! It's great to meet you. How are you feeling today? Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and support you.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2478,"Well, I really wish I could stop smoking altogether. I've cut down considerably. But can't seem to quit."
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2479,"You're feeling determined about wanting to quit smoking completely, and you've already made some progress by cutting down. It sounds like quitting is something you really want for yourself, and yet, it's been challenging to take that final step. What do you think has been making it tough for you to quit smoking entirely?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2480,I've been really ill for the past two years. So I'm stuck in bed the majority of the time. Which means I have very few pleasures in life right now and very few distractions or things to keep me busy.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2481,"That sounds incredibly challenging, being unwell and confined to bed for such a long time. Smoking might feel like one of the few comforts you have, something to turn to when life is otherwise so limited. It's understandable that in those circumstances, quitting can seem even tougher. What do you think might help you find other sources of comfort or distraction?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2482,I don't know. This is where I get stuck. I do a lot of things in my bed to distract myself. I get myself involved in things and manage to pass a lot of time. But after a few hours I get the urge.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2483,"It sounds like you've already put a lot of effort into finding ways to keep yourself occupied, even while bed-bound, and those urges to smoke still find a way through. The fact that you're able to keep yourself engaged for hours shows a lot of strength and resourcefulness. When those urges come up, what do you notice about them? Are there specific times or feelings that seem to trigger them?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2484,It's like it's my reward for having made it through so many hours not doing much beyond just existing and waiting to heal.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2485,"It really shows that smoking has become a kind of reward for enduring those long, slow hours, something that breaks up the monotony and maybe even feels like an accomplishment in itself. Given the lack of variety in your day-to-day life, having something that feels like a reward must be significant. What are some other ways you've found to reward yourself or to add some positivity into your day?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2486,"Well, I eat. I love sweets. Lately it's been chocolate chip cookies. I need something. And I'm afraid if I keep eating like this I'll gain so much weight. So I end up going between eating and smoking."
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2487,"You've found some comfort in sweets, like chocolate chip cookies, but there's a concern about the impact on your weight, creating a cycle between smoking and eating. It must be tough to feel like you're bouncing between these choices, both offering some temporary relief yet also adding to your concerns. How do you feel about this balance you've been trying to find, and what would look like a more ideal reward system for you?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2488,I can't find one right now. I feel like I'd lose my mind if I gave up either eating sweets or smoking. I feel stuck.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2489,"Feeling stuck in this cycle is really weighing on you, especially when both options feel crucial to maintaining your sanity right now. It's a challenging place to be, where the thought of giving up either feels overwhelming. Despite feeling stuck, it's clear you have a thoughtful awareness of what's going on. Is there anything that you’ve found even a little helpful when you’ve felt trapped like this in the past?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2490,"The best I can do is keep delaying. Like, I'll say I have to wait one more hour before I can smoke. It works for that hour. But it keeps getting tougher as time goes by. And I end up smoking."
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2491,"Delaying your smoking sounds like a strategy that’s been helpful for you, even if just for a short while, by giving yourself some control over the situation. It shows a lot of determination and strength to be able to hold off for that time. Even when it gets tougher and you ultimately smoke, each hour you delay is a small victory. How do you feel when you successfully delay smoking, even if only for an hour?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2492,I feel like a failure because I know that eventually I will smoke.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2493,"It's hard to view those moments as successes when there's the anticipation of eventually giving in to the urge. It's understandable to feel that way, but it's worth acknowledging that each delay is still a step forward, a sign of your strength and effort. Have there been any positives or things you've learned about yourself through this process of trying to quit?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2494,I've learned that cigs have a strong hold on me. I've learned that I can go for hours without them. But that it never leaves my mind completely.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2495,"You've come to see just how strong the hold smoking has on you, which is an important realization. You've discovered that you have the ability to go for hours without smoking—even if it's hard to fully let go of the thought. Each hour without smoking is a testament to your resilience and capacity for change, even in a difficult situation. Knowing what you know now, what do you see as your most important reasons for wanting to quit?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2496,I know it affects my health and my body's ability to fully heal.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2497,"Your health and your body's healing process are clearly very important to you, and it's frustrating to know that smoking could be getting in the way of that. Taking care of yourself and supporting your healing journey seems like a strong motivation for wanting to quit. How do you think your life might change if you were able to stop smoking completely?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2498,"Well, first off, I would save an extra hundred dollars a month. Second, I know I would start to see the health benefits rather rapidly."
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2499,"Saving that extra money and experiencing the health benefits could bring a lot of positive change to your life. Both financially and physically, quitting could offer you a lot of rewards, even more than you're already experiencing. It seems like these possibilities are important to you. Is there anything else you would like to talk about or explore before we consider some next steps together?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2500,No.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2501,"Thanks for sharing everything with me today. You've brought up a lot of important insights and desires for change. To summarize, you've expressed a strong desire to quit smoking for your health and finances, and you've been trying to navigate the challenges involved with finding comfort while bedridden. You've also shared how you've been able to delay smoking at times, which shows your capability for making changes. Would it be alright with you if we start talking about some possible steps you could consider moving forward?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2502,Definitely.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2503,"Great! We can take a look at the resources and strategies that might fit best with the insights and strengths you've shared. One option might be building on the delaying technique that's been somewhat effective for you. We could think about how to extend those intervals or find ways to support yourself during those tougher moments. Another possibility could be exploring some nicotine-replacement options to reduce cravings while continued efforts to find alternate rewards to smoking. How does any of that resonate with you, or are there other strategies you've heard of and might be curious about?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2504,I'm not sure about nicotine replacement. I've used those before and found them to be too strong for me. But advancing the delaying technique sounds like a winner.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2505,"It's helpful to know how your past experiences with nicotine replacement have been, and it's understandable why you're cautious about them. Focusing on advancing the delaying technique is a solid choice that's already shown some promise for you. We can think about ways to build on that, perhaps by incorporating activities or relaxation techniques during those intervals to support you even more. How do you feel about starting there and maybe brainstorming some specific ideas together?"
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,client,2506,I like that idea.
86,5ef1a79464e5837c95df3de8,counsellor,2507,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. We've had a meaningful conversation reaching the intended length, and I'd like to summarize what we've covered so far.

You've shared the challenge of being stuck in bed due to illness, leading to smoking and sweets being significant comforts for you. Your goal is to quit smoking for your health and to save money, though balancing these comforts is tricky. Despite feeling stuck, you've been trying strategies like delaying your smoking, and you appreciate the small victories in being able to hold off for hours. This indicates your strength and commitment.

Together, we've explored ways to expand on the delaying technique, and you're open to finding new activities during these intervals to support yourself. Strategies will focus on supporting your health while considering some alternative rewards and comfort options.

I want to acknowledge your courage and effort in working through this ambivalence and finding a path forward. Whenever you're ready, feel free to reach out again if you'd like to explore more strategies or simply want some support. Thank you again for your openness and trust. Take care, and I look forward to our next conversation."
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2508,Hello! It's great to meet you. I hope you're doing well today. How has your day been so far?
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2509,its going
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2510,"I'm glad to hear that. So, what brings you here today?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2511,i am doing a study avbout quitting smoking which i would love to do
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2512,"That's really interesting that you're studying quitting smoking, and it sounds like quitting is something you're considering personally as well. What about quitting smoking interests you?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2513,my lungs are clogged every morning
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2514,"That must be uncomfortable for you. It sounds like you are experiencing some health-related impacts from smoking, especially with your breathing in the morning. How do you feel about how smoking is affecting your health?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2515,not happy   been smoking since 15 . i am now 64
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2516,"It sounds like you've been living with smoking for a long time, and it's not bringing you the happiness or health you might want at this stage in your life. What do you think keeps you smoking, despite wanting to quit?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2517,habit. my brain is trained. just like i dont think about breathing or walking -i just do it- thats how i am about smoking. its like breathing to me. the reward part of my brain delivers dopamine as a
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2518,"Smoking has really become a part of your daily routine, almost automatic, like other basic activities you don't think about. It's understandable that it feels deeply ingrained after so many years. What do you think might happen if you began to change this habit?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2519,it would take much awaarness and thinking about it. it takes time to strengthen neural paths in my brain and smoking as areward is like scetched in my neural pathways
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2520,You're acknowledging that breaking this habit isn't just a matter of willpower but involves retraining your brain – something that would take awareness and effort over time. That awareness is already a valuable step in itself. What do you think could help you stay motivated in this process of change?
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2521,in all honesty it will take time and energy and time to teach my brain that not smoking is a reward.  my time and energy are limited. i am 64 years old and tired
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2522,"It makes perfect sense that you're feeling tired given the time and energy it could take to change something so deep-rooted, especially at this point in your life. Aging can add layers of fatigue, yet you're still here exploring the possibility of change. What do you think it would mean for you if you managed to shift that understanding of reward?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2523,it would mean not coughing up a lung every morning . at night as i lay all my mucus settles in my lungs and chest. after bering vertical for about 30 minutes the coughing goes away but it sucks
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2524,"That doesn't sound pleasant at all, and it's clear how much you're affected by the physical consequences of smoking, especially when it comes to living with those symptoms every day. The idea of reducing that discomfort by changing your smoking habit seems significant. What would be the most important benefit for you if you were to make this change?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2525,to stop coughing hard every morning    to save money and my wife is at her end with my smoking. her things smell and i get lazy as the night goes on and get ashes on the table or floor. also i live in
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2526,"You see a lot of valuable benefits in quitting smoking. You mentioned the relief from morning coughing, saving money, and even improving your relationship with your wife. It seems like making this change could positively impact many areas of your life, including the environment you live in. How do you feel about these possibilities?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2527,the last problem i couldnt type is that i live in a condo. the neighbors are pissed. the consequences are adding up the older i get.
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2528,"It sounds like the consequences of smoking are reaching beyond just personal discomfort, affecting your home environment and even your neighbors. It's clear that these accumulating factors are adding pressure and could be hard to manage over time. Given all of this, what stands out to you as the strongest reason or motivation to consider a change?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2529,my health but all of the reasons are pretty strong. i think low self esteem tells me i cant do it
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2530,"Your health emerges as a strong priority for you. You also recognize other compelling reasons for change, but low self-esteem might be whispering doubts about your ability to succeed. It's normal to feel that way when considering a big change. What is something you've accomplished before that required effort and determination, where you proved you could do something challenging?"
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2531,i stopped shooting heroin
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2532,That's an incredibly significant accomplishment. Overcoming something as challenging as heroin addiction takes immense strength and determination. It shows that you have the resilience and capability to make tough changes. How might the strength you demonstrated in the past help you as you think about changing your smoking habit?
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,client,2533,the problem is the drinking goes along with the smoking.
87,5e711d9e908b46031e32138c,counsellor,2534,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. Our time has flown by, and as we wrap up, I'd like to summarize some of what we've talked about.

You've shared that smoking has become such an ingrained habit, like breathing, and you recognize it's impacting your health, particularly with the morning symptoms you're experiencing. You identified some important reasons for wanting to make a change—like health benefits, saving money, improving your relationship with your wife, and reducing problems with your condo neighbors.

We celebrated an incredible strength from your past, having overcome heroin addiction, which shows your resilience and capability for tackling significant changes. Now, you're considering how your drinking and smoking might be linked, which adds another layer to think about moving forward.

Thank you again for your openness and courage in sharing these personal aspects of your life. If there's anything more you'd like to discuss or explore about these changes in the future, I'm here to support you whenever you're ready. Take care!"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2535,Hi there! It's great to have you here today. How has your day been so far?
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2536,"Hello, it's been okay so far"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2537,"I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about today, perhaps something related to your smoking habits or anything else that's on your mind?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2538,Yes I would like to stop smoking for health reasons but I am a bit worried about this and would like to know what help is there out there for me?
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2539,"It's really great that you're thinking about your health and considering a change. Stopping smoking can definitely be a big step, and feeling worried about it is completely normal. There are many different forms of support available, from counseling and support groups to medications and nicotine replacement therapies. We can explore those options together whenever you're ready. What's been on your mind the most about this journey?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2540,I have smoked for 40 years and tend to smoke more when I am drinking alcohol and when I get stressed.
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2541,"It sounds like smoking has been a part of your routine for quite some time, especially during certain situations like social drinking and stressful moments. These situations may link smoking with relaxation or coping. How do you feel about these connections, and what do they mean for you as you think about quitting?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2542,I feel quite anxious and worried. I'm sure I will find the cravings hard to deal with.
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2543,"It's understandable to feel anxious about cravings. Many people share that concern. Cravings can indeed be challenging, but it's important to recognize that they're temporary and there are strategies to manage them. What do you think might be helpful for you in dealing with those cravings or challenges as you consider making this change?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2544,I have heard that there is new medication out that stops the cravings of the brain signals
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2545,It's encouraging that you're exploring different options to help manage cravings. There are medications designed to reduce the urge to smoke and can support you in this journey. They work by lessening withdrawal symptoms and reducing the rewarding effects of smoking. Would you like to learn more about how these options work and consider if they might fit into your plans?
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2546,Yes please
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2547,"I'd be happy to provide more information. There are a couple of medications commonly used to help people quit smoking: varenicline and bupropion. Varenicline works by reducing cravings and the pleasurable effects of smoking, while bupropion helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke. Both can be effective tools in a quit plan, often alongside support like counseling or other therapeutic methods.

Have these types of medications been something you're considering as part of your approach, or are there other support options you're interested in as well?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2548,"These medications would be of interest to me, I'm sure if I manage to stop I will be able to breath much easier and in turn increase my exercise."
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2549,"That's a really positive outlook. Imagining the benefits, like easier breathing and being more active, can be a powerful motivator as you think about this change. It's wonderful to envision the improvements it could bring to your overall well-being. Is there anything else about the changes that you find motivating or exciting as you consider moving forward?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2550,I suffer from COPD and whilst quitting smoking won't cure this it will delay it getting worse. My clothes and hair won't smell of smoke. I won't be worried about where I can have a cigarette when out
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2551,"These are indeed significant motivators, especially with your COPD in mind. Quitting smoking can help slow down the progression of COPD and improve your quality of life. Not having to worry about the smell of smoke or finding a place to smoke can also bring a sense of freedom and freshness to your everyday life. It sounds like there are several meaningful changes you're looking forward to. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today or any other questions you have?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2552,How do I commence my road to quitting?
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2553,"That's an important question and a great step forward. Before we dive into planning, is there anything else you feel is important for us to talk about?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2554,Not at the moment
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2555,"Great, let's go over the key points we've discussed today: You've been thinking about quitting smoking for health reasons, especially considering the impact on your COPD. You've shared some situations where smoking is linked with drinking alcohol and stress. You are interested in medications like varenicline or bupropion to help manage cravings. You've also envisioned the benefits of quitting, such as easier breathing, less stress about smoking in public, and feeling fresher. 

Would you like to start discussing how to map out your journey to quitting, including the options and supports that might work best for you?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2556,Yes I would
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2557,"Great! We can look at a few key steps to get started. 

Firstly, setting a quit date can be a helpful way to prepare mentally and make concrete plans. Secondly, considering support systems: do you have friends, family, or groups you might lean on during the process? 

Finally, we can talk about consulting with a healthcare provider about medications that might support your efforts and how they fit into a comprehensive quit strategy. 

How does this outline sound to you, and which of these steps do you think you'd like to focus on first?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2558,That sounds perfect. I would like to focus on consulting with a healthcare provider regarding supporting my efforts
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2559,"That's a great place to start, as healthcare providers can offer valuable insights and help tailor a plan that suits your needs. They can provide information about medications, discuss their benefits, and ensure any underlying conditions like your COPD are managed throughout the process.

Are there any steps you might consider taking to set up that consultation, like contacting your doctor or exploring local healthcare resources?"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,client,2560,"Yes, I will contact my local GP surgery and make an appointment to see a healthcare assistant or even join a Stop smoking group"
88,5e19b24b2bf9512392d6dd90,counsellor,2561,"Thank you for taking the time to have this conversation today. We've reached the end of our current session, so let's summarize what we've discussed so far.

You've recognized the strong desire to quit smoking for your health, particularly with the impact on your COPD in mind. We talked about the connections between smoking, drinking, and stress, and you shared several positive changes you're looking forward to, like improved breathing and fewer worries about smoking. We've explored the option of medications that can support you in managing cravings, which you're interested in pursuing.

You committed to making an appointment with your local GP to discuss medications and support options and are considering joining a Stop Smoking group.

It's been a meaningful chat, and it sounds like you've started setting a solid foundation for your journey to quit smoking. If you want to continue this discussion or explore more, feel free to reach out anytime. Take care and good luck with your next steps!"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2562,Hello there! I'm really glad you could make it today. How are you doing?
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2563,I;m fine
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2564,I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to support you with whatever you’d like to talk about today. What's been on your mind lately?
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2565,I've been thinking about quitting smoking
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2566,That's an important decision you're contemplating. It sounds like you're weighing things out. What has led you to think about quitting smoking?
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2567,It's gotten expensive
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2568,"It sounds like the rising cost is having a real impact on you. I'm curious, in addition to the financial aspect, are there any other reasons that make you consider quitting smoking?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2569,Not really. I like smoking
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2570,"You enjoy smoking, and it brings you some satisfaction, but at the same time, the expense is a concern. It sounds like you're experiencing some mixed feelings about it. Can you tell me more about what you enjoy about smoking and how it fits into your life?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2571,I've been doing it so long it's part of my daily habits. I don't know what I would do if I didn't smoke
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2572,"Smoking seems to be deeply woven into your routine, almost like a familiar companion throughout the day. The idea of life without it is hard to picture. What do you think might change in your daily life if you were to quit?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2573,I don't know. I guess I would have more time but i don't know what I would do with that time
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2574,"It sounds like the thought of having extra time is intriguing, yet there's uncertainty about how you'd fill those moments. If you were to picture yourself having more free time, are there any activities or things you've wanted to explore but haven't had the chance to?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2575,Not really
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2576,"It's understandable that nothing specific comes to mind right now. Change can be challenging to envision, especially when a habit has been a part of your life for a long time. Is there anything else you've wondered about or felt curious about when it comes to smoking or the idea of quitting?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2577,I don't know where I would start
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2578,"Thinking about where to begin can certainly feel overwhelming. Finding the starting point often feels like the hardest part. Would you like to explore what the first steps might look like, or perhaps talk more about what quitting could mean for you?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2579,I wouldn't be able to do it cold turkey.
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2580,"It sounds like quitting all at once might not feel right for you. There are definitely other approaches out there that can be more gradual and fit better with what you need. Is there a specific approach or idea that you think could work for you, or would you like to explore different options?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2581,Explore options
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2582,"Absolutely, exploring your options can help you find the path that feels right for you. Before we go into those details, is there anything else on your mind about smoking or the idea of quitting that you'd like to discuss?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2583,No
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2584,"Alright, let's summarize what we've touched on so far. You've been thinking about quitting smoking primarily because of the cost, but it's something you're used to and enjoy as part of your daily routine. The idea of quitting cold turkey doesn't feel suitable for you, and you're open to exploring different options.

With your permission, we could start looking at some of the approaches that could help you if you decide to make a change. Does that sound alright to you?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2585,Yes
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2586,"Great! Let's consider some of the options that have helped others. There are various methods like using patches or gum, trying medications, getting support from a group, or even gradually reducing smoking over time.

Is there one of these approaches that resonates with you or perhaps something else you've heard about and might be interested in?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2587,I've tried patches and reducing somking over time and they haven't worked
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2588,"It's really good that you've tried different methods, and it shows your willingness to find what works for you, even if those attempts didn't lead to the change you wanted. It's all part of figuring out your path. 

Perhaps exploring new strategies or even combining them with support from a professional or support community might offer a fresh perspective. What are your thoughts on trying something like that, and how it might make the journey different this time?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2589,I don't think I would be comfortable with that
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2590,"It's important to feel comfortable with whatever path you choose, and your feelings matter in this process. Perhaps there's another way to approach this where you feel more at ease. What would make you feel more supported or confident in taking steps towards quitting?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2591,I'm not sure
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2592,"It's okay not to have all the answers right now. Sometimes, just thinking about it and allowing yourself to gather ideas without any pressure can be a helpful step.

If there is ever a time when you feel ready to explore further or if new thoughts come to mind, I'm here to support you. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore today?"
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,client,2593,No. Thank you
89,67270dd5d7b7e418ba4f296f,counsellor,2594,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let me summarize what we've talked about.

It's completely understandable, considering all the focus and energy you're putting into other goals. If you'd like, we can explore this further together, keeping in mind the hope and possibilities for the future you've mentioned. How does that sound to you?"
90,5f44021f15c23f6e8e413b91,client,2613,sounds great

You’ve expressed a strong desire to create a loving home where your kids can be proud of you and spoken about your plans to enhance your career and financial stability. It is clear these goals mean a lot to you.

We also delved into your health habits—how you're making strides with diet and exercise while feeling some ambivalence around smoking and drinking. You've shared that, despite putting these thoughts off for ""future you,"" you're aware of the potential impact smoking could have on your health, especially in light of your desire for a longer, more fruitful life. You’ve expressed a hope to be there for your kids as they grow and to see them thrive.

It seems like you’re holding a vision of a smoke-free future that could bring many positives, from personal health gains to deeper connections with your children. If and when you decide you're ready to explore changes in this area, I'm here to support you through that process.

92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2665,Hello! It's great to have you here today. How have you been feeling lately?
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2666,I have been fine. How are?
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2667,"Thank you for asking, I'm doing well. I'm glad to hear you've been feeling fine. I'd love to hear more about what's been happening in your life lately. Anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2668,Oh I've not been up to much really. My life is quite dull so don't have much to talk about
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2669,"I understand it can feel that way sometimes. Even in quieter moments, there can be things we wonder or feel uncertain about. Is there anything that's been on your mind, maybe something you've been considering or feeling unsure about?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2670,"Just thinking about my football team, that's all. They are called Burnley. Just been a bit concerned about their recent dip in form"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2671,"It's understandable to feel concerned about something you're passionate about, like your football team. Burnley's struggles might feel a bit frustrating right now. Do you find that watching football brings a bit of relief or maybe even adds stress sometimes?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2672,"It does both. It's stressful when they don't play as well as they can because they have one of the best teams in their league. When they do win, then I am happy of course."
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2673,It sounds like your emotions can really swing with how the team performs. It must be quite a ride experiencing both the stress and joy they bring. How do you usually cope when things don’t go as planned with the team?
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2674,Oh I just get annoyed but quickly forget about it.
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2675,"It's great that you're able to move past the annoyance and let it go. That ability to not dwell too long on disappointments can be really helpful. I’m curious, is there anything else in your life where you're finding it a bit tougher to let go or feel conflicted about?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2676,Not really. Things are fine with me. I'm content with my life at the moment
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2677,"Thank you for the conversation today. We touched on how you’re feeling about your football team, Burnley, and how their performance can bring you moments of both stress and happiness. Despite some disappointments, I admire how you can quickly move on and find contentment in other areas of your life. It was great to hear that you're feeling fine and content with how things are for you right now. If anything comes up in the future that you're thinking about, I'm here to listen and support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2678,"Yes, let's continue."
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2679,"I'm glad to hear that. Since you're feeling content and grounded overall, it might be interesting to explore if there's any area in life where you think there might be room for some changes or improvements, or even something new you're curious about trying. Is there anything that comes to mind?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2680,"Well, if I can give up smoking and reduce my drinking, that would be good"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2681,That's really insightful of you. It shows you're already thinking about areas that might enhance your well-being. Giving up smoking and reducing drinking are substantial changes to consider. What has prompted you to think about making these changes?
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2682,"A month ago, I felt pain in my throat. It turned out it was caused by GERD but I couldn't help thinking that smoking and drinking could exacerbate it."
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2683,"It must have been quite concerning to experience that throat pain, especially with the worry about possible contributing factors like smoking and drinking. It sounds like that experience may have acted as a wake-up call, highlighting the impact these habits might have on your health. How do you feel about the idea that changing these habits could possibly lead to improving your health?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2684,I am sure changes will lead to improvement of my health but I don't feel like I can do it. It's so difficult.
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2685,That feeling of difficulty is completely understandable and you're not alone in that. Acknowledging that it's tough is a significant step. It speaks to the struggle between wanting better health and the challenge of changing established habits. What do you think might make this process a little easier for you?
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2686,"Actually, I thought about this and thought that when my life becomes less stressful, such as the day I stop working, maybe that would be the time to give up smoking."
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2687,"It's clear that stress relief plays an important role in your life right now, and you're imagining a future time when it might become easier for you to make these changes. It sounds like your work adds a considerable amount of stress, and you see retirement as a time when you would have more space and calmness to make those changes. Until that day comes, is there anything you'd like to explore that might help manage stress while you continue working?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2688,"I am not sure. Most people cope with the stresses of daily life fine. For me, I think I'm being a bit selfish and want everything in life to be perfect. Do you think that's my problem?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2689,"It seems like you're holding some high expectations for yourself and your life, and it's leading to feeling like you should handle stress differently. It's definitely natural to want things to go smoothly and desire perfection, but it's also important to be kind to yourself when things feel overwhelming. Perfection is hard to achieve, and we all have our ways of dealing with stress. How do you feel about the idea of being a little gentler with yourself and recognizing that it's okay to seek balance in your own way?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2690,But how do I do that?
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2691,"That's a meaningful question. Finding balance and being gentle with yourself might involve noticing and appreciating the small things you do well each day, or exploring activities that bring relaxation and joy, whether that's a hobby, spending time outdoors, or connecting with friends. It can also be helpful to take things step-by-step, focusing on one positive change at a time rather than expecting everything to be perfect all at once. Is there a small step or habit that stands out to you as something you might want to try or incorporate into your daily routine?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2692,"Well, I have thought about it that way but still I have not found the answer. It seems like nothing will help me stop smoking until the day when I have no stresses in my life."
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2693,"It sounds like you're feeling like your current circumstances make it difficult to address smoking, and you're imagining a future where there's less stress as a better time for change. It’s understandable to feel that way when stress feels overwhelming. Until then, maybe we can consider little ways to handle everyday stress, adding up over time. 

Would you like to spend a moment thinking together about small stress-relief activities or routines that could support you now, even with smoking still in the picture?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2694,"OK, what activities do you suggest?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2695,"Thank you for being open to exploring this. Some people find it helpful to engage in activities like deep breathing or brief mindfulness exercises, which can be done in just a few minutes during the day. Others may benefit from setting aside time for physical activities, such as a short walk, gentle stretching, or even dancing to a favorite song.

Creating moments of joy or connection, like enjoying a hobby or spending time with friends or family, can also provide relief from stress. 

Of these options, is there one that resonates with you, or perhaps you have another idea in mind that feels manageable to try?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2696,"Oh none of those resonate with me, I guarantee you that. I do go for walks, play sport, etc. I don't believe in breathing exercises. How is breathing going to help?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2697,"It's perfectly okay if certain activities, like deep breathing exercises, don't resonate with you. It's essential to find what feels right for you. Walking and playing sports are great ways to handle stress, so it's great you're already doing those.

Breathing exercises can help some people by bringing awareness back to the present moment and creating a moment of calmness, but if it doesn’t resonate with you, that’s okay.

Is there anything you do that feels particularly soothing or enjoyable, even if it's a small daily pleasure? Or maybe there is something new you are intrigued to explore?"
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,client,2698,I find going on day trips or having a holiday very soothing and enjoyable. But it's catch 22 because I can't do enough of it as I have to work
92,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,counsellor,2699,"Thank you for spending time with me today. We've covered quite a bit, and as our conversation comes to a close, I'd like to summarize the main points we've discussed.

We started with your passion for Burnley and how the team's performance affects your emotions, sometimes bringing stress or happiness. You shared significant insights about your experience with throat pain and the role it played in prompting you to think about smoking and drinking. There's an understanding within you that these changes might improve your health; however, you're feeling the challenge of making these changes with everyday stress in your life.

We talked about the possibility of small stress-relieving activities, like enjoying a walk or playing sports, both of which you're already engaging in. Although deep breathing exercises aren't your preference, you mentioned that day trips and holidays bring you calm and enjoyment. There's a recognition of the challenge in balancing work and these soothing activities.

I appreciate the openness and thoughtfulness you've shared today. If anything changes for you or you wish to explore more, know that you're welcome to reach out again. Take care and have a great day!"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2700,Hello! It's really nice to meet you today. How are you doing?
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2701,I'm doing pretty good! How about you?
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2702,"I'm glad to hear you're doing well! I'm doing great, thank you. I'm here to support you today, so feel free to share whatever is on your mind. What would you like to talk about today?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2703,"So we should talk about smoking, yeah?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2704,"Yes, if that's something you're open to discussing. Many people have a mix of feelings about smoking. How do you feel about your smoking right now?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2705,"I mean, I'm 36, I've been smoking since I was probably 16"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2706,"You have quite a history with smoking, spanning two decades. It sounds like it's been a significant part of your life for a long time. How do you feel about that journey and where you are now with smoking?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2707,"I know it's harmful in the long run to health, and I feel the effects of smoking for decades. But it's not bad, certainly not enough that demands the abrupt and painful cessation of smoking."
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2708,"It sounds like you’re aware of the health impacts and have experienced some effects after years of smoking, but you're balancing that with the discomfort or challenge of quitting. What are some of the things that keep you smoking, or the benefits you feel from it?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2709,"Oral fixation is definitely a big part of it. It's habitual that I want to have something to do with my mouth regularly. If I were to go cold turkey, I'd be wanting to snack on chips or something 24/7"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2710,You find that smoking satisfies that need for an oral activity and worry that stopping might lead to other habits like snacking. It sounds like there's a strong connection between smoking and your daily routines. How do you see that oral fixation impacting your life now or in the future?
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2711,"It can be a problem, for instance, with a new job. Your habits are that you constantly have access to your cigarettes, but the new job dictates that you can't smoke whenever you want. That can be hard"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2712,"It sounds like there's a conflict between your smoking habits and the demands of your new job. That adjustment can be challenging, especially when you're used to having that accessibility. How important is it for you to adapt to this change, and what are your thoughts on finding a balance between smoking and your work life?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2713,"Sorry, that was more past experience, I'm currently unemployed. It's important to adapt to those work rules because otherwise you're not going to hold that job long."
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2714,"It makes sense that adapting to those work rules is crucial for maintaining a job. Even though you're not currently employed, you've had experiences where smoking impacted your work life. How do those past experiences influence your thoughts about smoking now?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2715,"They make me think that not smoking is more convenient for job searching, just a limitation I don't have to worry about"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2716,"It sounds like you're recognizing the convenience and potential benefits of not having smoking as a limitation, especially when considering job opportunities. How do you feel about this realization, and what do you see as potential next steps for yourself?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2717,But that's not near enough for me to even consider not smoking
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2718,"You're acknowledging the convenience of not smoking, but it doesn't feel like a strong enough reason to make a change. It seems like the benefits of smoking, at least for now, still outweigh the reasons to quit. Is there anything else that has ever made you consider, even briefly, the idea of cutting back or stopping?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2719,The only reason that has made me seriously consider not smoking for longer than a period of a couple weeks is vanity. The fact that smoking can ruin your youthful appearance.
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2720,"It looks like the impact smoking can have on your appearance is a significant consideration for you. The thought of maintaining a youthful look holds some weight in your mind. How does that aspect influence your feelings about smoking, and have you noticed any effects you'd like to change?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2721,"It hasn't seriously impacted me at all. I know it's bad and that it has negative consequences on my appearance through skin elasticity, etc. But it's not enough. to dissuade me."
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2722,"You've thought about the potential effects on your appearance, but it hasn't reached a level where it motivates you to make a change. It sounds like you're in a space where you hold awareness of the negatives but aren't convinced to make a shift yet. Is there anything else that you think might be important to explore in relation to your smoking?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2723,"I've had that same perspective for over 15 years, it's hard to think that something will make me change. Except the obvious, like emergency hospitalization directly related to it."
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2724,"It appears that your perspective on smoking has been quite consistent over the years, and it would take something quite significant, like a health crisis, to consider a change. You seem to have a clear understanding of where you stand right now. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your relationship with smoking or explore further at this moment?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2725,"I can't think of a specific point I'd like to bring up, is there anything you would like to ask me?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2726,"You've shared some valuable insights into your experience with smoking, and I appreciate your openness. Would it be alright with you if we summarized what we've talked about so far, and then see if there's anything more you'd like to add or discuss about a potential path forward?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2727,Sure!
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2728,"Thank you. So far, we've explored your long history with smoking over the years, acknowledging the challenges and the benefits it holds for you, like oral fixation and the impact on your routines and past professional experiences. You've considered factors such as health and appearance but feel that they aren't compelling enough to quit.

You're aware that something major might be needed to shift your current perspective. Is there anything else you'd like to reflect on, or do you feel this covers most of your thoughts on smoking right now?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2729,I feel like that is a good summary of our conversation and a reflection of where I stand currently.
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,counsellor,2730,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. To summarize our conversation, we discussed your long-term relationship with smoking, the oral fixation it fulfills, and how habits have impacted your past job experiences. We've acknowledged the awareness you have regarding the health impacts and appearance concerns, even if they haven't been strong enough motivators for change just yet. You expressed that a significant health event might make you reconsider your current stance. I appreciate your openness in exploring these facets of your smoking journey. Let me know if there’s anything more you’d like to add or any other support you might need.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
93,6718da927f1110131780367d,client,2731,No
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2732,Hi there! How's your day going so far?
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2733,"It's going great, thanks for asking. How about you?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2734,"I'm doing well, thank you! I'm glad to hear your day's been going well. So, as we settle in here, what would you like to focus on during our conversation today?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2735,I would like to attempt to quit smoking and not just for one day or two.
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2736,That sounds like a significant decision you're thinking about making. What are some reasons that have led you to consider quitting smoking for good?
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2737,I want to focus on being healthy. I have a bit of health issues and I've been going to the gym but overall I just want to be a healthier person.
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2738,Your focus on health and making positive changes for yourself is quite powerful. It sounds like you're motivated by a desire to improve your overall well-being. What are some aspects of your health that you're hoping to improve by quitting smoking?
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2739,I have shortness of breath so it becomes hard for me to breathe at times especially at night or when I'm sleeping.
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2740,"That must be really challenging to experience, especially when it affects your sleep. It seems like your breathing issues are having an impact on your daily life. How does this shortness of breath influence your thoughts about continuing to smoke?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2741,"It makes me want to change because I also have sleep apne, stress, and anxiety. So I just want to finally be a different person."
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2742,"It's understandable that experiencing sleep apnea, stress, and anxiety along with shortness of breath would lead you to want to make a change. Quitting smoking seems to be a significant step toward becoming the healthier and different person you're aiming to be. What would you envision life being like if you were able to quit smoking and address these health concerns?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2743,"I would save a lot more money, I wouldn't smell as bad from smoking, and I would change up all these bad habits and turn them into good habits."
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2744,"Saving money, smelling better, and transforming bad habits into good ones are admirable goals to strive for. Imagining these positive changes in your life seems to bring a sense of possibility and motivation. What do you think might help you in taking the next step toward achieving this vision for yourself?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2745,"I'm not really sure, I just know I can't quit cold turkey because as I said I'm someone who stresses a lot and I have anxiety so I need an alternative that would stick."
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2746,"It's great that you're aware of what might not work for you, like quitting cold turkey. Finding an approach that's more suitable for you can make a huge difference. Have there been any methods or strategies you've heard about or considered that might feel like a better fit for your journey toward quitting smoking?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2747,Some people mentioned nicotine patches but I'm not sure.
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2748,"Nicotine patches could be one option to explore, especially if you're looking for something to help manage cravings gradually. It's understandable to feel uncertain about which path to take. It might be helpful to think about what you need to feel comfortable and supported during this process. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we possibly explore more about these options together?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2749,I think I've covered most of it
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2750,"Great, thank you for sharing all of that with me. To summarize, you've expressed a strong desire to quit smoking to improve your health and overall well-being. You're considering options like nicotine patches but want something that aligns well with managing stress and anxiety.

Would it be okay with you if we now shift our conversation toward discussing some potential plans and strategies to support you in this journey?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2751,Yes of course
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2752,"Wonderful. Let's take some time to explore options that could help you feel more confident and supported in this process. We can look at different methods like nicotine replacement therapies, strategies for managing stress and anxiety, and even lifestyle changes that might align with your goals. What feels like a good starting point for you?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2753,Probably therapy first and foremost
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2754,"Therapy can be a valuable support system on your journey. It might help you address stress and anxiety while you work on quitting smoking. Engaging with therapy could offer you tools and coping mechanisms tailored to your unique situation. Is there a specific type of therapy or support you're interested in, or would you like to explore a few options?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2755,Not really sure probably something to address my current issues and rely on something more healthier
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2756,"Considering therapy to address your current issues while fostering healthier ways of coping sounds like a thoughtful approach. You might find Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helpful, as it focuses on reframing thoughts and behaviors, which could support both stress and smoking cessation. Additionally, mindfulness practices might offer a healthier alternative for managing stress. Would exploring these options further be of interest to you?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2757,Doesn't sound like a bad idea at all
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2758,"Great! Exploring options like CBT and mindfulness can provide you with tools to tackle stress, anxiety, and smoking cessation effectively. Connecting with a therapist who specializes in these areas could be a strong next step. How do you feel about starting this process by reaching out to a qualified therapist who can guide you in the right direction?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2759,I would need time to consider it more and see what my options are
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2760,"Absolutely, taking the time to consider and explore your options further is a wise approach. You deserve to feel confident and comfortable with whatever steps you decide to take. If you have any questions or need more information as you consider your options, please feel free to reach out. I'm here to support you on this journey in whatever way you need. What are your thoughts on possibly looking into resources or support groups in the meantime?"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2761,I'm not that big on support groups because I'm a shy person but I would look into some resources and see what I can find
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2762,"That makes sense, especially if you're not as comfortable in group settings. Exploring resources at your own pace can offer valuable insights and guidance. This could include reading materials, online tools, or even apps designed to help with smoking cessation and stress management. If there's anything specific you're curious about or any assistance you need as you explore these resources, don't hesitate to reach out. You're already taking meaningful steps towards change, and that's commendable."
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2763,"Thank you, I appreciate it"
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2764,"You're welcome! I'm really glad you reached out today, and I'm here to support you whenever you need it. Take your time as you consider your options, and remember that you're not alone on this journey. When you're ready, we can continue to explore more ways to support your goals. Until then, take care and be kind to yourself."
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,client,2765,:)
94,5c67c5d4085e6a0001fed61b,counsellor,2766,"Thank you for our conversation today. Here's a summary of what we've discussed so far: You're motivated to quit smoking, driven by a desire for better health and overall well-being. You shared that your shortness of breath and other health issues like sleep apnea have led you to want healthier habits. You envision being a different person who saves money, avoids the smell of smoke, and replaces bad habits with good ones. We talked about potential methods, like nicotine patches and therapy options such as CBT and mindfulness practices. While you're still considering your next steps, you're open to exploring resources that can support your journey. You've shown a strong commitment to change, and I'm here to assist you whenever you're ready to continue this process. Take care!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

95,5c4d87576aeb5d00010184f8,counsellor,2768,Hello there! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?
95,5c4d87576aeb5d00010184f8,client,2769,fine thanks

95,5c4d87576aeb5d00010184f8,client,2771,"yes, ive been smoking for many years and cant quit"

But, in the morning, if you don't have that first cigarette, you might find it easier to go without for a while. What are some of the things you enjoy about smoking during those times?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2884,"I dont think i particularly enjoy smoking, its just what i do when im not busy, if im busy i dont mind not smoking, its only when i think about it i want to"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2885,"It seems like smoking has become a part of your routine, especially when you have downtime, but it’s not necessarily something you feel compelled to do when you're occupied with other activities. When you find yourself thinking about it, what do you find yourself thinking or feeling?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2886,That i have time and i have to fill it. Smoking relieves anxiety but only anxiety caused by not smoking
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2887,"It sounds like smoking sometimes feels like a way to fill moments when you're not busy and can perhaps bring relief, but that the anxiety it addresses might actually be tied to the act of smoking itself. How do you feel about this cycle and the way it impacts your day-to-day life?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2888,i dont feel like it does impact my daily life
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2889,"It seems that, for you, smoking is integrated into your routine but perhaps doesn't stand out as something that heavily impacts other areas of your life. Have you ever thought about what life might be like without smoking, or is that not something that's crossed your mind much?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2890,"i read a book once and tried to stop, it felt easy and i didnt smoke for 3 days but i was so bored"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2891,"It sounds like that attempt gave you a taste of what not smoking could be like, but the boredom you experienced was a real challenge. Those three days show that you have the ability to go without, which is significant. What do you think made it feel so easy at first, and what was it about the boredom that made you want to return to smoking?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2892,"i think because it was new and didnt feel like a challenge, i was busy too. the boredom was feeling like i should be doing something else while watching tv or driving."
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2893,"It seems that when you first tried it, the newness and staying busy helped, but when you hit those routine moments—like watching TV or driving—that's when the urge crept back in. It's understandable that those familiar activities would bring up those feelings. If you were to consider trying again, is there anything you might want to do differently to address those times when boredom strikes?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2894,"I dont know to be honest, i cant think of anything that would help in those moments"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2895,"It’s okay not to have the answers right now. Exploring this is a process, and you're already taking important steps by reflecting on your experiences. If you’re open to it, we can continue to think about ways to handle those moments together. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any specific concerns or thoughts about smoking that are on your mind right now?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2896,"no, i would like some ideas on how to tackle those moments"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2897,"Thank you for letting me know what you’d like to focus on. Based on our conversation, you've identified that staying busy can help, but the challenge is when routine moments create that urge to light up. Would it be alright if we explore some ideas together on how to approach those specific moments when boredom strikes?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2898,yes
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2899,"Great. One approach might be to think about small, engaging activities that you could try during those times. For instance, having something to fidget with, listening to music or a podcast during drives, or trying simple breathing exercises during TV time. How do these suggestions sound to you, or are there any activities you already enjoy that you think might work?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2900,thank you for the ideas. im not sure they're for me. I already listen to something while driving but it doesnt stop me smoking.
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2901,"I understand, and I appreciate your openness about what's working and what might not. It's about finding what fits best for you. Since listening to something feels normal, perhaps we can brainstorm other activities that could help during those moments. What are some things you enjoy or have ever been curious to try that might be different from your usual routine?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2902,that i can do while driving or watching tv?
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2903,"Yes, exactly—something you can do during those moments that might feel engaging or satisfying. If driving or watching TV is a time you're used to smoking, maybe there's something else that could share your attention or offer a new focus. Is there anything that comes to your mind?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2904,no there isnt
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2905,"That's perfectly fine. It can be challenging to come up with alternatives on the spot. Would it be helpful to reflect more on what you enjoy when you're not smoking, or perhaps on any small changes you've thought about trying in other aspects of your routine? Our goal is to find something personal and meaningful to you."
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2906,ok
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2907,"Thank you for being open to this reflection. Let’s take a moment to consider some of the things you currently enjoy or find fulfilling, even outside of smoking. What are some activities or interests that bring you enjoyment or relaxation?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2908,"doing my nails, reading, painting, workking"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2909,"Those are some wonderful activities, and it's clear you have a varied set of interests. Doing your nails, reading, painting, and working all seem to engage you in different ways. While driving and watching TV, perhaps there's a way to draw on a similar sense of focus or creativity—like audiobooks related to your reading interests, or nail care products designed for quick use. How do any of these ideas feel in relation to times you're usually your smoking?"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,client,2910,"i still smoke while doing these things though. the only time i dont smoke is when im busy indoors and its not allowed, working in a food environment or asleep"
98,6658b8079bdcfc7da425e0ec,counsellor,2911,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. Our conversation has reached its intended length, so I’d like to take a moment to summarize the key points we've discussed.

We've explored your relationship with smoking, noting how it's integrated into your daily routine, especially during downtime or routine moments like driving or watching TV. Although it doesn’t heavily disrupt your life, you expressed that it can offer relief from anxiety caused by smoking itself. 

You shared an experience where you stopped smoking for a few days, finding it easy when you were busy but reverting back due to boredom during those routine activities. We've also discussed how certain activities like doing nails, reading, painting, and working engage you, yet smoking still finds its way into that space, except in environments where it's not allowed.

We've touched on some strategies and ideas to perhaps fill those moments differently, though identifying something that feels impactful is a process we're continuing to explore. 

Feel free to think about these ideas and any others that may come to mind, and we can continue to work through them if you decide to explore this further. Thank you again for your openness and willingness to engage in this conversation. Please feel free to reach out whenever you're ready to continue. Take care."
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2912,Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling as we begin our session?
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2913,I feel good
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2914,"That's great to hear. I'm really glad you came today. Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to chat about, particularly around your smoking habits or anything else that's been on your mind?"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2915,"Honestly, I've been thinking about quitting smoking a lot lately. It's just getting harder to keep up with the habit, you know? The cost, the health concerns, the social stigma."
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2916,"It seems like you're really noticing the different ways smoking is impacting your life, from the financial burden to feelings about health and how others might perceive you. These are all important considerations. What's been the biggest factor making you think about quitting lately?"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2917,"You know, I think it's been a combination of things, but if I'm being honest, it's probably been my family. My kids are getting older, and they're starting to ask me more questions about why I smoke."
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2918,"It sounds like your family, especially your kids, are becoming a significant motivation for you. Their curiosity and questions could really be highlighting the contrast between your role as a parent and your smoking habit. How does that feel for you?"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2919,"I want to be someone my kids can look up to, someone who sets a good example. And smoking just doesn't fit with that."
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2920,"You're really striving to be the kind of parent your kids can admire and learn from, and smoking seems to feel at odds with how you envision that role. It's clear that you value their perception of you and their well-being. How does that influence your thoughts about making a change?"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2921,"I want to be someone my kids can be proud of, and smoking is just not compatible with that. When I think about quitting, it's not just about me anymore; it's about being a better role model for them."
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2922,"Your strong commitment to being a positive influence in your children's lives is really compelling. You're viewing quitting not just as a personal change, but as a step towards embodying the values you want to pass on to them. That broader perspective can really bolster your motivation. Have you envisioned what life might look like if you were to quit smoking entirely?"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2923,"I've started to think about that a lot, actually. If I were to quit smoking entirely. I imagine it would be a really freeing experience."
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2924,"You're imagining a sense of freedom that comes with letting go of smoking. That imagery can be powerful and inspiring. What does that newfound freedom mean to you, both for yourself and for your relationship with your kids?"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2925,"It means everything to me. For myself, it means breaking free from the physical and mental grip of smoking. It means being able to live my life without being controlled by nicotine"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2926,"This idea of freedom encompasses breaking loose from the constraints that smoking has placed on you, both physically and mentally. It suggests a significant step toward reclaiming control and autonomy over your life. How do you think this change could transform your day-to-day experiences with your kids?"
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,client,2927,I think it would be a game changer. I would be able to participate in activities with my kids without getting winded or feeling exhausted.
99,6667276a6083d675d2459fa3,counsellor,2928,"Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with me today. As our session comes to an end, I'd like to summarize what we've talked about.

You expressed that smoking has been on your mind a lot lately, especially in light of the financial, health, and social aspects. Your family, particularly your kids, have become a big motivation for thinking about quitting. You want to set a positive example for them and be someone they can look up to. This goal has led you to envision a life free from the control of nicotine, where you experience increased freedom for yourself and more fulfilling interactions with your children—like fully engaging in activities without feeling exhausted or winded.

We've explored the significance of these motivations, and your desire to transform the role you play in your family life. It sounds like there's a clear vision for the change you're starting to contemplate.

If you're ready, we can explore more about this in future sessions, just let me know if there are any topics you’d like to delve into next time. Thank you again for being here, and taking this important step toward the freedom and example you wish to achieve."
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2929,Hi there! I'm glad to have you here today. How are you feeling as we start this conversation?
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2930,A little trepidation.
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2931,"It's completely normal to feel a bit uncertain when starting something new. I'm here to support you, and there's no pressure. We can take things at your pace. How about we start by talking about what's on your mind today?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2932,Our current U.S. election and I'm curious about this non-smoking conversation.
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2933,"The election can certainly bring up a whole range of emotions and thoughts. It's a significant time for many people. And when it comes to our conversation about smoking, feel free to share anything you’re curious about or interested in exploring. There's no rush, and we're here to approach it together comfortably. Is there anything specific about smoking that you find you're thinking about lately?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2934,"I find smoking comforting and soothing, like an adult pacifier."
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2935,"It sounds like smoking offers you a certain comfort and relief, like a way to find calm in the midst of life’s stresses. It's understandable to seek out something that provides that feeling. What are some situations where you feel smoking gives you the most comfort?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2936,"Drinking a cup of coffee, after a meal, when I'm playing a game on the computer, paying bills"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2937,Smoking might feel like a companion in those everyday activities and moments when you might be looking to ease a bit of tension or just enjoy a moment. It seems to be intertwined with those routines. Do you also notice moments when smoking doesn't quite fit or feels like it might be in the way?
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2938,Out in public as we're now social pariahs
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2939,It seems like smoking in public might bring a sense of unease or awareness of being perceived differently by others. Finding oneself in that position can feel isolating. How does that experience shape your thoughts about smoking or how it fits into your life?
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2940,"I just try to be polite as possible as I know I am now in the minority, unlike the 70s, 80s, early 90s"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2941,"Navigating those changes in social norms and expectations can be challenging, especially when you're adjusting to being in the minority as a smoker now. It must require some conscious effort on your part to be mindful of others. Given these shifts over time, has the change in how smoking is viewed affected how you see your own smoking habits?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2942,"I don't see them negatively as I am mindful of others and smoke at home, in my car, or in environments where many people smoke, e.g. a casino."
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2943,"You've found ways to balance your smoking habits with being considerate of those around you, mainly by choosing spaces where it feels more accepted or personal. It seems like you've carved out areas where smoking feels more comfortable and less of an issue. How do you feel about the places where smoking is more accepted, and what about them appeals to you?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2944,"The fact that it is acceptable, although, e.g., I am near a non-smoker at the casino, I sit as far away from them as possible or don't smoke at all."
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2945,"It shows a lot of thoughtfulness on your part to ensure you're being considerate, even in spaces where smoking is generally accepted. You've found a way to enjoy those environments while still being mindful of others. Do you think this balance affects how you view your smoking in other aspects of your life?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2946,"No, as a retiree, I am not as social as I used to be and my partner (non-smoker) does not have a problem with it."
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2947,"It seems like you've found a personal and social balance that works for you, especially now that you have a supportive partner who respects your choices. Having that understanding can make it easier to feel content with your habits. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in your life at this point, especially with the changes retirement brings?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2948,"I am probably smoking more than before. At work, there were hours in between a cigarette so I know I can go without, but there's no restriction now."
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2949,"Without the structure of work, it might be easier to reach for a cigarette more frequently throughout the day. It's interesting to note that you know you're capable of going longer without smoking when you're in an environment with more restrictions. How do you feel about the increase in smoking since retiring, and how it fits into your current routine?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2950,I'm really only concerned with the cost.
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2951,"The financial aspect of smoking seems to be standing out to you now, especially with a change in routine and possibly income after retirement. It can be quite impactful to consider how those costs add up. How do you feel about the financial side of smoking and its effect on your budget or other interests?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2952,"Well it does not impact any interests. The costs can be difficult to adjust to. However, my partner often buys them for me when he sees I'm running out, so it's not affecting me overall."
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2953,"Even with your partner's support in sharing the expenses, there might still be an awareness of how costs are shifting in this stage of life. It sounds like you appreciate the help but still notice the economic impact overall. In this context, how do you see your relationship with smoking moving forward?"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,client,2954,"Frankly, I enjoy it, and long ago I tried hypnosis and it worked; I found it distasteful. However, I am not overemotional, especially in public, and all I did was cry. My co-workers all said, please s"
100,65735a2100e6cf8638803943,counsellor,2955,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. As we wrap up our conversation, I'd like to summarize some of the key points we've touched on.

We talked about how smoking feels comforting to you, like an adult pacifier, and how it fits into your routines, such as enjoying a coffee or playing computer games. You also shared the challenges of smoking in public and have taken steps to be considerate of non-smokers.

Since retiring, you mentioned smoking more frequently due to the lack of restrictions a work routine provided, and your main concern with this increase is the cost. Despite the financial side, you still enjoy smoking, and your partner's support helps manage the expense.

We also explored your past experience with hypnosis as an attempt to quit, which, although it had some effects, was emotionally challenging for you. It seems like you're in a place where you're balancing smoking with the changes and dynamics of retirement, and the financial aspect is a point of consideration moving forward.

I'm glad we could explore these different facets together. Whenever you're ready to continue this conversation or if you have any other thoughts or questions, feel free to reach out. Take care!"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2956,"Hello, and welcome! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling about joining this session?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2957,great
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2958,"I'm glad to hear that! It's a good starting point. What would you like to focus on today, or is there anything specific about smoking or anything else that you'd like to explore together?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2959,that is all
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2960,"You're open to talk about smoking, great. Could you share a bit about your experiences with smoking? What's your relationship with it like these days?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2961,I use smoking as a way to procrastinate what i am supposed to be doing
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2962,"It sounds like smoking serves as a break or a distraction when you're dealing with tasks or responsibilities. How is that working for you overall, using smoking in this way?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2963,Oh not great
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2964,It must be frustrating if smoking is getting in the way of things you want to accomplish. What do you notice happening when you choose to smoke instead of doing what you planned?
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2965,feel guilty
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2966,"Feeling guilty must be tough to carry. It shows that you care about your responsibilities and the impact smoking has on them. What do you think keeps you turning to smoking, even though it leaves you feeling this way?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2967,im not sure
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2968,"That's okay. It's not always easy to pinpoint why we do certain things, especially when it involves habits like smoking. What are some benefits you feel you get from smoking, if any, that might make it challenging to let go of?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2969,a break
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2970,"Taking breaks seems to be important for you, and smoking offers a way to step away and pause for a moment. How do you feel about the idea of finding different ways to take those breaks, ones that might not involve smoking?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2971,I'm open to tit
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2972,"Being open to exploring new ways of taking breaks is a great start. Before we delve deeper into planning or discussing alternatives, is there anything else about smoking or your current situation you'd like to talk about?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2973,no
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2974,"Okay. To summarize, we've talked about how smoking is something you use to procrastinate and take breaks, even though it sometimes leaves you feeling guilty. You’re open to exploring other ways to take breaks that might not involve smoking. Does this capture what we've discussed so far accurately?

If you're comfortable, would it be alright to talk about some possibilities or steps you can take from here?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2975,sure
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2976,"Great, I'm glad we're moving forward together. Let's consider what kind of activities or methods might help you take those needed breaks in a more positive way. Are there any hobbies or relaxing activities you enjoy that we could incorporate into your breaks?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2977,reading
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2978,"Reading could be a wonderful way to find some relaxation and take a break. It offers the chance to pause, much like smoking does, but maybe with less of the guilt afterwards. How do you feel about substituting a smoking break with a few moments of reading instead?"

101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,counsellor,2980,"It sounds like you're open to giving this a try, which is fantastic. Starting small, maybe you could carry a book or an e-reader with you, and when you feel the urge to pause, you can read a few pages. How does that sound as a first step?"
101,6361a6a7be16d8144319fd3a,client,2981,ok

To summarize our conversation, we've explored how smoking functions as a way for you to take breaks and procrastinate, although it sometimes leaves you feeling guilty. We talked about your openness to trying new ways of managing your break time, like reading, which could offer a relaxing pause without the guilt of smoking. You've decided to try carrying a book or an e-reader and substituting your smoking break with reading. I admire your openness and courage as you consider these steps. If anything changes or if new thoughts arise, we can dive into them in our future sessions.

It takes courage to consider changes amidst such challenging times, and your willingness to explore these options shows a lot of resilience. If you need support along the way, remember I'm here. Take care.

105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3091,tehy have been going ok but could have been better
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3092,Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like there's a bit on your mind. What's been happening that seems to be making things just okay rather than better for you?
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3093,money issues
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3094,"That sounds tough. Financial stress can really weigh you down. How does that compare with what's been happening in other areas of your life, like your smoking?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3095,my smoking is good
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3096,It sounds like smoking might be something you're comfortable with or find helpful during stressful times. Can you tell me more about how smoking fits into your life right now?
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3097,i smoke after i eat and when i am stressed
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3098,"Thanks for sharing that. Smoking after meals and during stressful moments seems to be a routine part of your day. I'm curious, what do you like about having those cigarettes during those times?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3099,it makes me feel good
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3100,"Smoking brings you a sense of relief or comfort, especially during times of stress or after eating. On the flip side, do you notice any drawbacks or concerns with your smoking?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3101,t is habit
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3102,"So, it feels like a habit for you – something that's just a part of your daily routine. Does the idea of it being a habit bring up any particular thoughts or feelings for you?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3103,no
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3104,"I understand. It sounds like smoking is a stable part of your routine and doesn't stir up any strong feelings at the moment. Is there anything specific you'd like to explore or discuss about your smoking today, or any other areas you're curious about?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3105,no nothing else
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3106,"That's perfectly okay. I think you've shared some valuable insights with me today about how smoking fits into your life. Would it be alright if we talk a bit about where you see this continuing in the future, or any small changes you'd be interested in exploring?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3107,i would be interested in cutting down
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3108,"That's great to hear. You're considering cutting down, which shows you're open to exploring some changes. Before we move further, is there anything else you'd like to share about your thoughts on cutting back or anything else on your mind?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3109,no
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3110,"Alright, thank you for sharing. To sum up our conversation, we've talked about how smoking feels like a comforting routine for you, especially during certain times of your day. You've also expressed an interest in cutting down. If you're ready, would it be okay with you if we discuss some steps or options you might consider to start moving in that direction?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3111,yes tahts ok
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3112,"Great. Let's explore some initial steps you might take to begin cutting down. We can look at your smoking patterns and think about small changes that might feel manageable. Where would you like to begin, or do you have any thoughts on what those first steps could look like for you?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3113,i am not sure where to begin
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3114,"That's completely understandable. It can feel overwhelming to think about where to start. We can take it step by step together. How about beginning by noticing when you smoke the most and identifying if there are any times or triggers you might be willing to try cutting back on, even just a little? Does that sound like a good place to start exploring?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3115,yes
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3116,"Great! Paying attention to your smoking patterns can be a helpful first step. Perhaps you could try tracking when you feel the urge to smoke and jotting down what you're doing or feeling at that moment. It might help us figure out specific times or situations where you could experiment with cutting back. If you'd like, we can discuss what you notice in our next session. How does that sound to you?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3117,sunds perfect to me
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3118,"I'm glad to hear that. It sounds like we've got a plan to start with. Remember, this is a journey, and taking small steps is perfectly okay. Feel free to reach out if anything comes up before our next session. Looking forward to hearing how it goes for you. Take care!"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3119,ok bye
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,counsellor,3120,"Thank you for today's conversation. Let me summarize what we've touched on: We've explored how smoking fits into your daily life, offering comfort during stressful times and after meals. Though you see it as a habit now, you've shared an interest in starting to cut down. Together, we've considered the idea of tracking your smoking patterns to identify potential areas for small changes. This could help us find manageable ways to reduce smoking over time. I'm really looking forward to hearing how this goes for you in our next session.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
105,567f59e0d18c640011e7ac0b,client,3121,No
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3122,Hello there! I hope you're having a good day so far. I'm glad we've got this opportunity to talk. How are you feeling as we get started?
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3123,I'm feeling good thank you
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3124,"That's great to hear! If you're ready, I'd love to know what brings you here today and what you'd like to focus on during our time together."
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3125,I am trying to stop smoking
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3126,"That's an important decision, and it's great that you're considering making such a positive change. What has motivated you to want to stop smoking, and what are some reasons it's important to you?"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3127,for both health reasons and to save me money
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3128,Prioritizing your health and finances shows a lot of insight and determination. It sounds like improved well-being and financial freedom are valuable to you. How do you feel smoking affects these areas in your life now?
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3129,"well it costs me money that I really can't afford right about now and the smoking makes me feel ill, i'm always coughing etc"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3130,"It seems like smoking is taking a toll both financially and on your health, with your budget feeling the strain and your body experiencing discomfort like coughing. How does it feel to acknowledge these impacts?"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3131,It feels fine I gave no problem acknowledging the problem
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3132,It's great that you're clear about the impact smoking has on your life. Are there any barriers or challenges you see in your journey to stop smoking?
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3133,I just find it hard to stop
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3134,"Many people find stopping to smoke challenging, so you're definitely not alone in feeling that way. What are some things you've noticed that make it particularly hard for you?"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3135,The cravings and being used to smoking for so long
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3136,"Cravings can be really powerful, and breaking a long-established habit can feel daunting. It takes a lot of awareness to recognize these as hurdles. What are some moments or situations when you notice these cravings are the strongest?"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3137,"Just when I haven't had one for a while, so mornings the craving is strong after I have slept"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3138,"Mornings can be tough because the habit has been interrupted overnight, and the body might be really yearning for that first smoke of the day. It's a significant observation. As you think about those moments, what do you feel might help in managing those cravings when they come?"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3139,I have no idea
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3140,It's completely okay to feel uncertain about what might help with those cravings. Sometimes exploring small and simple changes can make a difference. Is there any particular approach or strategy you’ve considered or heard about that you're curious to learn more about?
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3141,No I don't know of any strategy's
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3142,"Thank you for sharing that. There are different strategies and approaches available, and exploring them at your own pace can be helpful. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore further before we consider some possibilities together?"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3143,No thats all
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,counsellor,3144,"Thank you for our conversation today. Before we wrap up, I'd like to summarize what we've talked about. You've mentioned that you're interested in stopping smoking for both health reasons and to save money. Smoking seems to be affecting you financially since it's a strain on your budget, and it's also impacting your health, causing you discomfort like coughing. You recognize the challenge of getting over the cravings and breaking the long-standing habit, especially in the mornings. We focused on understanding these impacts and acknowledging the difficulties you face, and although you're not aware of strategies yet, you're open to learning and exploring options that may work for you. It's an important step that you're considering these changes, and I'm glad we could discuss them today. 

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
106,5dc5da21d999de45a504651b,client,3145,No
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3146,Hello there! I'm glad you could make it today. How have you been feeling lately?
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3147,I'm OK.
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3148,I'm glad to hear that you're doing alright. Is there anything specific going on in your life that's been on your mind lately?
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3149,Not particularly. The usual.
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3150,I understand. Sometimes the usual can be quite a lot in itself. I know we're here to talk a bit about smoking. How do you feel about your smoking habits at the moment?
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3151,"It's depressing. I've given up so many times, but can't seem to quit."
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3152,"It sounds like you've been through quite a journey with smoking, and I really appreciate you sharing that with me. It can be tough when you've made attempts to change but feel stuck. What keeps you motivated to keep trying?"
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3153,Health reasons mainly. I got through periods when my breathing's labored and I feel very weak.
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3154,"That sounds really challenging, especially when breathing becomes difficult and you feel weakened. It seems like you're quite aware of the impact smoking has on your health, and that awareness is driving you to make those changes. What do you think has been the most difficult part of quitting for you?"
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3155,"Not smoking that first morning, always seem like falling off a cliff. It's just so automatic. Even when I prep the night before, most of the time I find myself doing it anyway. It's auto pilot."
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3156,"It sounds incredibly frustrating to wake up with such a strong habit that it feels like it's happening without even thinking. Breaking routines that have become automatic, especially ones that start your day, can be really tough. I'm curious, when you do prepare the night before, what kind of steps do you take?"
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3157,"Usually I start a quit midday, so I have at least 12 hours nicotine free. It helps remind me in the morning first thing. Otherwise I'll just forget or won't bother. Vested interest, I suppose."
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3158,"Having that vested interest and finding a time that sets you up for a better chance of success sounds like a thoughtful approach. Those 12 hours nicotine-free are a significant step and show a lot of determination. During those times when you've managed to stick to your decision not to smoke, what has helped you through those moments?"
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3159,"I'm usually fine after I get over the morning cigarette. I use supplements like niacin or rhodiola for withdrawals, and magnesium for calm and glutamine for blood sugar control."
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3160,It's impressive how you've identified and used different supplements to support yourself through withdrawals and other discomforts. It seems like you've built a personalized routine that makes you feel more equipped. Are there other strategies or supports you think could further enhance your efforts in these early morning hours?
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,client,3161,Not smoking first thing is really motivation or grit. The rest of the day I can manage. I don't really have anything for the morning. Times I've quit sucessfully were really down to sickness.
107,5d2b24c5f91bdd0016e9865e,counsellor,3162,"Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and experiences with me today. We've reached the intended length of our conversation, so I'd like to recap what we've discussed.

You've expressed that smoking is something you find depressing, and you've made several attempts to quit in the past. Health concerns have been a significant motivator for change, especially when you've experienced labored breathing. The mornings present a particular challenge with smoking being so automatic, and you've creatively addressed this by starting your quit attempts midday to give yourself overnight tobacco-free hours. You've found various supplements helpful in managing withdrawals and regulating your body's responses throughout the day, which shows your commitment to finding effective ways to support yourself.

It sounds like a mix of motivation, grit, and some strategies that have helped you in the past, especially during those morning moments when it's most challenging. Even though getting sick has been a successful way to quit in the past, you’re clearly exploring mindful approaches that don’t depend on being unwell.

If there's anything more you'd like to explore or discuss, I'm here to help. Otherwise, I look forward to our next conversation and continuing to support you on this journey."
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3163,Hello! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling about being in this session?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3164,I feel good about being in the sessions and I hope that it helps me quit
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3165,That's a positive outlook to have. It sounds like making a change is something you're considering. What are some of the reasons you're thinking about quitting smoking?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3166,Because it's unhealthy and I don't want to get cancer also I don't like the way my clothes smell like cigarettes and my whole house smells like cigarettes it's gross
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3167,"You've mentioned some important concerns—your health, like the risk of cancer, and also the impact smoking has on the smell in your life. Those sound like compelling reasons to think about quitting. What's it like for you right now living with these concerns?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3168,I don't know what you mean what's it like for me right now living with these concerns I have no idea sorry I don't know
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3169,"That's okay, there's no right or wrong answer. You're thinking about these concerns and noticing the impact of smoking in your life. How do these thoughts about your health and the smell affect your feelings toward smoking?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3170,It makes me more driven to quit smoking
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3171,It sounds like these concerns are really motivating you to consider quitting. You're feeling driven to make a change. What else might be pushing you toward wanting to quit or perhaps pulling you back to keep smoking?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3172,Those are the reasons that I can think of And something that keeps making me smoke is the cravings are absolutely ridiculous and that's why it's absolutely horrible I hate being a slave to a cigarette
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3173,"It seems like those cravings have a powerful hold on you, and it's frustrating to feel that dependency on cigarettes. Balancing that drive to quit with the struggle of cravings sounds challenging. What do you think makes it hard to manage these cravings right now?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3174,Something that makes it hard to manage is not having the cigarette
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3175,Not having a cigarette when the craving hits makes it really difficult. That pull can be intense. What do you normally do when those cravings come up?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3176,Smoke because that's the only thing to do to get rid of it
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3177,Reaching for a cigarette is the way you find relief from those cravings. It seems like having a reliable way to manage them could be helpful if you're considering quitting. What other strategies have you thought about or tried in the past?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3178,Using a vape pen helps a lot and I've also used the nicotine patch with step two of the nicotine patch because step one does not help but step two is effective along with using a vuse vape pen
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3179,"You've experimented with a few options like the vape pen and the nicotine patch, and it seems like step two of the patch, along with the vape pen, has been useful for you. You're already exploring different ways to support yourself in this process. What's been your experience with using these methods to manage your cravings?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3180,It worked really well and but there were still one or two moments during the day the craving was intense and I had to take a few hits off a cig
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3181,"So, using the patch and vape pen has been helpful for most of the day, but those strong cravings still hit occasionally. It's impressive that you've tackled most of them with these tools. What do you think might help during those particularly intense moments?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3182,Being able to take a couple hits off of a cigarette not smoking the whole thing but only just taking a couple puffs
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3183,"Taking a few puffs seems to provide you with a way to manage those especially intense moments. It sounds like you're trying to find a balance that works for you. How do you feel about this approach, and is there anything else you're considering trying?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3184,Nothing else I have considered trying and I think step two of the nicotine patch and using the vape pen with an occasional couple puffs off of a cigarette works
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3185,"You've found a method that seems to work for you—using the patch, the vape pen, and occasionally having a couple of puffs. You're building a strategy that fits your needs and helps you manage cravings. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore today related to your journey?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3186,Maybe trying to get in the right mindset I don't know how to explain it but reframing my thinking maybe making myself believe that I can do it then I know I can
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3187,"You're thinking about strengthening your mindset and rethinking your beliefs to support yourself more effectively. Reframing can be a powerful tool, and believing in your capability to make this change is key. Would you like to talk more about ways we might explore this kind of positive reframing together?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3188,sure
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3189,Great. A good starting point could be identifying some positive statements or affirmations that reflect your strengths and goals. What are some things you believe or would like to believe about your ability to quit smoking?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3190,That I can quit smoking
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3191,Believing that you can quit smoking is a strong and empowering statement. It's a testament to your determination and desire for change. What other strengths or qualities do you possess that can support this journey?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3192,I dont know Honestly I don't know
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3193,That's okay. Recognizing strengths can take some time. You've already shown determination by attending this session and exploring different strategies. Your openness to finding what works for you is also a strength. How do you feel about using these qualities in your journey to quit smoking?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3194,Sounds good
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3195,It sounds promising to tap into your determination and openness. These qualities can really support you in this process. Is there anything else you'd like to touch on today before we wrap up?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3196,Not that I can think of unless you can provide any tips that would be helpful too
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3197,I have some ideas that might be helpful. Would it be okay to share them with you?
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3198,Yes sure please do
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3199,"Thank you. Some people find it helpful to set small and realistic goals, like gradually reducing the number of cigarettes each day or finding a new routine when cravings hit. Another strategy could be identifying specific triggers and planning how to respond to them. How do these ideas resonate with you?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3200,Those are good tips thank you
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3201,"I'm glad you found them helpful. Feel free to take things at your own pace, and know that you can reach out for support whenever you need it. I'm here to support you in any way I can. Would you like to set a follow-up session to continue working on this, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3202,Yes let's have a follow-up session please
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3203,"Great! We'll set up a follow-up session to continue supporting you on this journey. We'll pick up where we left off and explore more strategies together. Take care, and I'll look forward to our next meeting."
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3204,Thank you
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,counsellor,3205,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about so far. You came into this session with a strong desire to quit smoking, motivated by concerns about health, the smell of smoke, and wanting to live smoke-free. You've been using a combination of step two of the nicotine patch and a vape pen, finding that helpful for most of the day, though occasionally faced with intense cravings. You've expressed an interest in exploring your mindset and reframing your thinking to believe in your ability to quit. We've talked about your determination and openness as strengths, as well as some strategies like setting small goals and identifying triggers. I'm glad we've set up a follow-up session to continue this journey together. Thank you again, and I'm here to support you as you work towards your goals.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
108,62b0ff84054c6ca32f481c65,client,3206,No
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3207,How are you feeling today? I'm glad you're here for this session. What's been going on with you lately?
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3208,feeling good ty
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3209,"I'm glad to hear that. As we get started, feel free to share whatever's on your mind. How have things been with smoking for you lately?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3210,yeah i would really like to quit but my willpower has failed me multiple times
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3211,"It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated. It seems like quitting is something important to you, but you've found it difficult to achieve on your own. What draws you to the idea of quitting smoking?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3212,mainly the health benifits i think
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3213,Thinking about the health benefits sounds like it's a big motivator for you. It shows that you care about your well-being. What would be the most rewarding part of experiencing those health benefits for you?
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3214,not getting sick and having a strong immune system and being more active
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3215,"Staying healthy and active seems really valuable to you. It paints a picture of a lifestyle where you're able to do more of the things you enjoy without being held back by health concerns. Given these benefits, what do you think has been holding you back from quitting smoking?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3216,I think i am addicted strongly and I give up too easily at times
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3217,"It sounds like the addiction feels powerful, and sometimes it feels easier to stop trying than to face the struggle. It's really common to feel that way. What do you think would help you feel more supported or capable of taking on this challenge?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3218,I am not sure really
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3219,"It's understandable to feel uncertain about where to start. Sometimes, working out what support you need can be as important as finding the motivation itself. Can you think of any past experiences or strategies that have helped you face other challenges in your life, even if they're not related to smoking?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3220,yeah i think exercise and feeling good in general would make the task somewhat easier and less daunting
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3221,"So, exercise and maintaining a positive mindset might help you feel more confident and less overwhelmed in tackling this challenge. It sounds like when you engage in activities that make you feel good, it bolsters your strength—both physically and mentally. How might you incorporate these helpful strategies into your plan to quit smoking?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3222,I guess i should try to incorporate more exercise in my daily life to fill the gaps
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3223,"Incorporating more exercise into your daily routine might really enhance your ability to take on quitting smoking. It seems like a step you feel open to exploring and integrating. Is there anything else on your mind about this process, or any other topics you'd like to talk about today?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3224,well i would like to ask have you any strategies or methods which help the process of smoking cessation
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3225,"I’d be happy to discuss some strategies with you. Before we dive into that, let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about so far: you’re motivated by the health benefits of quitting, like having a strong immune system and being more active. You’ve also mentioned that incorporating exercise into your routine might support your efforts.

Would it be okay with you if we spend some time discussing some strategies that align with these goals?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3226,yes
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3227,"Great! Some strategies people find helpful include setting a quit date, building a support network, and identifying triggers that lead to smoking. Since you mentioned exercise, you might consider pairing physical activities with moments you feel the urge to smoke. 

How do these ideas resonate with you? Is there anything specific you'd like to start with or something else you're curious about?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3228,yes they sound good
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3229,It's great to hear that these ideas resonate with you. Would you like to explore setting a specific quit date or perhaps identifying some of your triggers? Let me know which step feels right to focus on for you.
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3230,yes i would like to explore setting a date
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3231,"Setting a quit date can be a powerful commitment to yourself. It gives you something to prepare for and work toward. Do you have a date in mind that feels both challenging and achievable for you? Or, would you like to consider some options together?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3232,2019-11-24
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3233,"Choosing November 19th, 2024, sounds like a meaningful step towards your goal. It gives you a clear target to aim for and some time to prepare. How do you feel about this date, and what might be the first step you want to take as you get ready for it?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3234,I think really if i want to do it i should be prepared to try at any time so why not in a few days
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3235,That's a courageous shift in perspective—being ready to start soon shows your commitment to this change. Preparing to make the quit attempt in just a few days can boost your momentum. What practical steps would be helpful for you to prepare in this shorter timeframe?
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3236,I think perhaps cutting down smoking in between now and then might ease the transition process somewhat
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3237,Gradually cutting down on smoking sounds like a sensible approach to ease the transition. It gives your body some time to adjust while you build your confidence. How do you plan on managing this reduction? Are there certain times or situations where you plan to focus on smoking less?
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3238,i think smoking maybe every two hours might be a step then gradually increase that to 3 hours
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3239,"That’s a thoughtful approach, focusing on extending the time between cigarettes. It allows you to gradually adjust your routine and cravings. How do you plan to handle the times when the urge to smoke arises during those intervals?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3240,I think i will try to stay busy and do some exercise
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3241,"Staying busy and incorporating exercise during those times can be a great way to refocus your energy and manage cravings. It ties back to the positive, healthy routine you want to build. What kind of exercises or activities are you thinking about to keep you engaged?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3242,possibly golf or walking
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3243,"Golf and walking sound like enjoyable and active options. They can both provide a refreshing break and help keep your mind off smoking. How do you feel about setting up a plan to include these activities in your daily routine, especially during those times when cravings might hit?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3244,good
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3245,"That's wonderful! Setting up a plan with these enjoyable activities can support you in this journey. Is there anything else you’d like to add to your plan, or any support you might need to help make these initial steps more manageable?"
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,client,3246,no not at the present moment
109,659583e0d5fab84895bfac7c,counsellor,3247,"You're taking some thoughtful and positive steps towards quitting, and that's commendable.

110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,counsellor,3261,"You're concerned about the potential long-term health risks, like cancer, that smoking might cause. That's a really serious consideration, and it's understandable that you're thinking about it. It sounds like protecting your health is important to you. How does smoking fit into your daily life right now, and how do you feel about the role it plays?"
110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,client,3262,it helps me relax
110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,counsellor,3263,"Smoking offers you a sense of relaxation, which can be quite appealing, especially when dealing with stress or life's pressures. On one hand, you're worried about your health in the long run, but on the other hand, smoking provides you with immediate relief. How do you balance between these concerns and the need to relax?"
110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,client,3264,"i dont know, do you have any ideas"

110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,counsellor,3269,"That sounds intriguing. It seems like the experience left an impression on you. What about it stood out, and did anything from that experience help you consider different approaches to managing your smoking?"
110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,client,3270,it showed that im more so addicted to the act of smoking rather than the actual cigs
110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,counsellor,3271,"You've discovered that the act of smoking itself is something that draws you in. That's an insightful realization and can be very helpful in understanding what plays a role in your smoking habit. Knowing this, what do you think might be the next steps in exploring other ways to satisfy that habitual part?"
110,60abca98eca58f378b17dc20,client,3272,im not sure but im finished talking about this

Today, you expressed your concern about the long-term health risks of smoking, including cancer, which is important to you. You mentioned that smoking brings you relaxation, and that it plays a habitual role in your life. We also talked about how you've experimented with using weed as a substitute, which led you to realize that you’re more drawn to the act of smoking than the cigarettes themselves. 

This awareness is an important first step in understanding your relationship with smoking. Whenever you're ready to explore this further or discuss other alternatives, please know that I'm here to support you. Thank you again for sharing your time with me today, and take care."

111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3282,"Wanting to live a longer, healthier life is such a powerful motivator. It sounds like you've really thought about how smoking affects your future. On the other hand, are there things that make quitting feel challenging for you?"
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3283,yes all of my friends smoke
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3284,"Having friends who smoke can make it tough to quit, especially if it's part of your social routine. It sounds like being around them might create a bit of a struggle between wanting to quit and wanting to stay connected. How do you feel about handling that situation?"
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3285,"im not sure as i want to continue chilling with the,m"
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3286,It's understandable that you want to continue enjoying time with your friends. Those connections are important. You're figuring out how to balance the relationships you value with the changes you're considering. What do you think might help you manage that balance if you decide to move forward with quitting?
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3287,if my friends can also quit smoking
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3288,Having your friends quit smoking too would definitely provide you with a strong support system. It could make the journey easier for you and might even strengthen your friendships. Have you talked to any of your friends about your thoughts on quitting?
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3289,yes but they dont want to quit
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3290,"That can be a tough situation. It seems like your path towards quitting might be a personal journey for now, even if your friends aren't joining you. I imagine it might feel a bit isolating, having to take a different route than those close to you. How does that leave you feeling in terms of moving forward with your goals?"
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3291,it weill m ake me feel left out and lonely when they are all smoking and i am not
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3292,"Feeling left out and lonely is a real concern, and it’s okay to acknowledge that. Staying connected with your friends is clearly important to you, and at the same time, there's this goal of quitting smoking for your health and well-being. What might be some ways for you to stay engaged with your friends while you work on this personal goal?"
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3293,im not sure maybe i can use a vape to help
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3294,Thinking about alternatives like using a vape could be a way to bridge the gap between staying socially connected with your friends and working toward quitting cigarettes. It's a personal choice and might serve as a middle step in your journey. Is there anything else on your mind about how switching to a vape might help in your situation?
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3295,no can you suggest me anything
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3296,"I appreciate you asking for suggestions. It's sensitive to provide advice, so it's great that you're open to exploring options. Besides considering a vape, some people find success in setting boundaries, like stepping away for a moment when friends are smoking, or finding new activities to do together that don't involve smoking. There are also smoking cessation programs, support groups, or even apps that can offer guidance and connection during this time. Does any of that sound interesting to you?"
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,client,3297,yes that sounds interewsting thank you for the suggestions
111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3298,"You're welcome! It's great to hear that some of those ideas resonate with you. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore regarding your goal to quit smoking?"

111,631755de69157e27c295a340,counsellor,3300,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's summarize our conversation: You expressed a strong motivation to quit smoking because of concerns for your health and how smoking affects your smell, alongside wanting to live a longer life. You mentioned that your friends smoke, which makes quitting challenging due to the fear of feeling left out and lonely. We talked about the possibility of using a vape as a potential middle step to help you manage this change, while keeping the social connections with your friends.

112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3305,no
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3306,"That's perfectly okay. We can take things at your pace. Whenever you're comfortable, we can talk about anything you'd like to explore. If there's anything specific you're hoping to get out of our session, feel free to let me know."
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3307,no we just talking
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3308,"Of course, we can just chat. If there's anything on your mind you're comfortable sharing, we can explore that together. Or if you prefer, we can talk about your day or anything else that interests you. It's completely up to you."
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3309,how are you doing
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3310,"Thank you for asking! I'm here and ready to listen. This time is all about you, so whenever you're ready to chat about anything that's important for you, just let me know."
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3311,what do you want out of this conversation
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3312,"That's a great question. My role here is to support you in exploring what's important to you, whether it's about something specific or more general. If there's anything you'd like to talk about—doesn't matter how small or big—I'm here to listen and help in any way I can. If smoking is something you're thinking about, we can discuss that as well, but we can cover whatever feels right for you."
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3313,I have tried to quit in the past
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3314,It sounds like you've had some experiences with trying to quit smoking before. That can be a challenging journey. What was it like for you during those times?
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3315,pure hell
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3316,That sounds incredibly tough. It can be really difficult when trying to make a change brings so much struggle. What do you think was the hardest part for you?
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3317,the mentality of it first time almost drove me insane
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3318,It sounds like the mental aspect was really overwhelming for you. It's not easy when something that feels ingrained in daily life becomes such a challenge to manage. What do you think made it feel almost impossible back then?
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3319,Like a thousand knives in your head
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3320,"That sounds incredibly intense and painful. Trying to navigate through those feelings must have been so difficult. It can be really challenging to deal with such strong and overwhelming emotions. What do you think kept you going during those times, or is there anything in particular you wish you had as support back then?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3321,My ex
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3322,Your ex played a role in supporting you during that time. Having someone close can make a big difference when going through a tough challenge. Is there anything about that support that you found especially helpful or would like to talk more about?
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3323,"I did it for her, she was not exactly supporting she drove me nuts during the first month lol"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3324,"It sounds like you were motivated to make the change for her, even though her approach might not have been the most supportive for you. Relationships can be complex, especially when it feels like there's added pressure or stress. Reflecting on that time, is there anything you learned about what kind of support or motivation works best for you?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3325,Its all about will power
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3326,You feel that relying on your own determination is crucial for making changes like quitting smoking. It seems like you really value your ability to draw on your own inner strength and resolve. What do you think helped you harness that willpower during your previous attempts?
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3327,I wanted it and I did what I needed to do to get it.
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3328,"You had a clear desire and took the necessary steps to pursue it. Having that strong internal drive and focus can be empowering. Going forward, how do you feel about your ability to tap into that willpower again, or is there anything different you feel you might need this time around?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3329,"I can do it again, but I was naive to think that I could sustain it."
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3330,"You've shown yourself that you have the power to make the change, but maintaining it presented its own challenges. Recognizing this is important as it can inform a different approach if you decide to try again. If sustaining the change is something you're reflecting on, what do you think might help this time to support a more lasting shift?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3331,Less stress and more support.
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3332,Having less stress and more support in place could potentially make a big difference for you. Balancing stress and having a network of support can be really helpful in maintaining changes. Is there a specific type of support or way to manage stress that you think might be particularly beneficial for you as you consider moving forward?
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3333,Meditation
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3334,"Exploring meditation as a form of support and stress reduction sounds like a promising idea. It can offer a sense of calm and help center your thoughts. Have you had any experiences with meditation before, or is it something you're thinking about trying as you move forward?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3335,Trying
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3336,"Trying something new like meditation can be a great step. It may offer a different way to manage stress and support you in your journey. As you begin exploring this, is there anything you're hoping will change or improve as you incorporate meditation into your routine?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3337,not sure
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3338,"That's perfectly understandable. When trying something unfamiliar, sometimes the experience itself can guide you to insights or benefits you hadn't anticipated. If you ever want to discuss how it's going or what you're noticing, I'm here to listen and explore it with you. Is there anything else about this journey or your thoughts on smoking that you'd like to talk about?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3339,Just that it is a journey and everybody is different in how they will overcome it.
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3340,"Recognizing that it's a personal journey and that everyone finds their own path is a powerful insight. Each person's experience and way of overcoming challenges is unique, and honoring that individuality can be especially important. If there's anything more on your journey that you'd like to reflect on, I'm here to support you. And if you're considering next steps or pondering about a change, we can explore that too. Would you like to discuss anything else related to this?"
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,client,3341,no
112,66db58ca73be06273e7f8d78,counsellor,3342,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. To summarize our conversation, you reflected on your past attempts to quit smoking, expressing how challenging the mental aspect was and the intense experiences you faced. Your ex was a motivator at the time, though the support was complex. You acknowledged relying on your own willpower and inner strength as fundamental parts of your journey. We touched on the potential for meditation to offer stress relief and support. You've recognized that each person's journey is unique, and you're exploring your own path with an understanding that maintaining change might involve handling stress differently and seeking supportive experiences. I'm here to continue this journey with you whenever you're ready.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

It sounds like it might be quite challenging right now. I'm here to support you as you explore what's going on for you. Would you like to share a bit more about what might be contributing to your increased smoking or anything else on your mind?

113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3348,"I'm really sorry to hear about your dad's stroke. It must be incredibly difficult and worrying for you. It sounds like smoking might be providing you with some temporary relief from the stress you're experiencing. It's understandable to seek comfort during such a tough time. 

Is there anything else you'd like to express about how you're feeling or how this situation is affecting you?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3349,Very stresful and start crying
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3350,"I can only imagine how overwhelming this must be for you. It's okay to feel this way and to allow yourself those emotions. I'm truly here with you, and it's a safe space to express what you're experiencing. What do you find really challenging about this situation, and how has it been impacting your day-to-day life?"

113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3352,"You're under a lot of stress and it's affecting every part of your life, especially with the constant worry about your dad's condition. It's like your mind is always on high alert, wondering what the next phone call might bring. This must be very exhausting and hard to deal with. How do you usually cope or manage these feelings when they come up?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3353,It was big shock
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3354,"It sounds like the situation with your dad came as a sudden and significant shock, which is completely understandable. Coping with such unexpected news can be really tough, and it's natural to feel shaken. You're navigating through some heavy emotions right now. 

Have there been any moments or things that have brought you a bit of comfort or peace during this difficult time?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3355,Yes my kids give me energy and my husband help me too
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3356,"That's really heartening to hear. It seems like your kids and your husband's support are sources of strength for you during these challenging times. Having a family you can lean on can be incredibly valuable. 

As you think about your smoking and the role it's playing now, how do you feel about it in the context of this support from your family?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3357,I try to not smoking too much but sometimes not can stop smoking
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3358,"You find yourself trying to cut back on smoking, but sometimes it feels difficult to stop entirely, especially during stressful moments. It sounds like there's a part of you that wants to change, especially with the support of your family. Balancing the stress and your desire to smoke less can be quite a challenge.

What have you noticed about the times when you are able to smoke less? Are there particular things or strategies that help during those moments?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3359,I will try
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3360,"It's great to see that you are considering trying different things to manage your smoking. This willingness to explore change is a wonderful step. Your intention to try shows your strength and openness to finding what works for you. 

Is there anything else you want to talk about before we think about what the next steps might be for you in this journey?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3361,No what is the next step
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3362,"Thank you for sharing so much with me today. Here's a quick summary of what we've talked about: You're facing a challenging time with your dad's health, which has affected your smoking habits. Despite this, you have support from your family and are open to finding ways to manage your smoking better.

If you're ready, I'd love to discuss some small, manageable steps you could consider taking toward your goal to smoke less. Would that be okay with you?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3363,I am ready
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3364,"Great! Together, we can explore some options for steps that might feel manageable for you. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Identify Triggers:** You could think about which moments or situations are most likely to lead to smoking and consider if there are any small changes you could make in those moments.
   
2. **Alternative Activities:** Maybe finding an activity that helps you relax or distracts you when you feel the urge to smoke could be helpful, like going for a walk or trying a breathing exercise.

3. **Reach Out for Support:** Continuing to lean on your family's support could also be beneficial. Sharing your journey with them might provide encouragement and accountability.

Does any of this resonate with you, or is there something else you'd like to explore as a next step?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3365,1 is better
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3366,"Focusing on identifying triggers sounds like a meaningful next step. Gaining insight into the specific situations or emotions that tend to lead to smoking can really empower you to make choices that align with your goals.

As you go through your days, perhaps you can start to notice when and where the urge to smoke hits hardest. You could jot down a few notes about what's happening in those moments to see if any patterns emerge.

How do you feel about trying this out? Would there be anything helpful to support you as you explore this?"
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,client,3367,No i
113,6715013670bed7e4e955f109,counsellor,3368,"That's perfectly okay. Taking it one step at a time and seeing how things unfold is a great approach. Remember, this is your journey, and you're in control of how you move forward. I'm here to support you whenever you need it.

114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3377,I feel fine
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3378,"That's good to hear. As we spend time together, I want this to be a space where you feel comfortable sharing whatever's on your mind. Is there anything particular you'd like to talk about today?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3379,Not in particular
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3380,"That's perfectly okay. We can take our time and go at your pace. Since part of what we're focusing on here can be smoking and any thoughts or feelings you might have about it, would you be open to sharing a bit about your experience with smoking?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3381,"I feel pretty neutral about it, it's just something I do"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3382,"It sounds like smoking is a part of your routine, something that you don't really think too much about. On one hand, it might just feel like a normal habit, and on the other hand, it might not hold any strong feelings for you. Where do you think this sense of neutrality comes from?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3383,I've been smoking since I was 12 so that's probably where
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3384,"You've been smoking for quite a long time. It seems like it's been a significant part of your life for many years, almost like it's just always been there. Given this long history, has there been any point where you've thought about the role smoking plays in your life?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3385,Yeah I quit for two years back in college
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3386,That's impressive that you were able to quit for two years during a time that can be really stressful and full of changes. What was that experience like for you during those two years?
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3387,"It was fine, I didn't miss it that much"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3388,"It sounds like during those two years without smoking, you didn't miss it significantly and were able to adapt pretty well. Looking back at that time, is there anything in particular that helped you stay smoke-free, or any aspects of not smoking that stand out to you now?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3389,"Not really, I just didn't do it anymore"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3390,"You made a decision, and it seems like you found it manageable to just not smoke during that period. It sounds like stopping smoking then wasn’t something you struggled much with, which is interesting. As you think about your current smoking, are there any thoughts or feelings that come up for you today?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3391,I'm too addicted at the moment and extremely stressed
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3392,Coping with addiction and stress at the same time can be really challenging. It seems like smoking might be playing a role in how you manage stress right now. How do you think smoking connects with stress relief for you?
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3393,The literal affect it has like stress relieving obviously
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3394,"It seems like the immediate effects of smoking provide you with some relief when you're feeling stressed. At times, smoking serves as a kind of quick break or moment of calm amid everything else going on. Are there other ways you've found to manage stress, either now or in the past, that have also been helpful?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3395,Drinking
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3396,"Using drinking as another way to manage stress suggests you're looking for ways to find some relief. These approaches might offer some quick respite, even if they aren't perfect solutions. How do you feel about the role both smoking and drinking play in your life right now as ways to cope with stress?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3397,I feel that I do it
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3398,"It sounds like these habits are just part of your current routine when managing stress. Given where things are now, is there anything else you'd like to reflect on or explore about smoking or stress, or perhaps something else entirely?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3399,"Not particularly, I know I need to quit and plan on it but it's not new information in any way to me I'm already self aware"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3400,"You've already recognized and acknowledged that you want to quit smoking, and it sounds like you're well aware of its role in your life. That self-awareness is an important part of any journey toward change. Is there anything about the idea of quitting or the future without smoking that you'd like to talk about today?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3401,"No, thank you!"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,counsellor,3402,"Thank you for this conversation. Let's briefly review what we've discussed today. You've shared that smoking has been part of your life for a while, starting from when you were 12. You managed to quit during college for two years and seemed to find that period without smoking quite manageable. Recently, smoking and drinking have been ways that you've coped with stress, although you've recognized they're not the only solutions. Your self-awareness about the need to quit smoking is evident, and you've planned on making that change when you're ready. Thank you again for being open, and I'm here whenever you're ready to continue this journey.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
114,663a64da0dbc37192d930b1c,client,3403,No

115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3408,"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed. Life can definitely throw a lot at us sometimes. Would you like to share a bit about what's been causing you stress lately, and maybe we can explore it together?"

115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3422,"Smiling can be a simple yet powerful way to change our mood and perspective, even when things feel tough. It's like a reminder to yourself to find the good in every situation. In this process of embracing positivity, how does smoking fit into the picture for you, if you're open to sharing that?"
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3423,it helps relieve stress when I dont have time for exercise
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3424,"Smoking seems to be a fallback for managing stress when life gets busy, especially when you can't get that time for exercise. It's understandable to turn to something that feels helpful in a moment. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in your stress management overall?"
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3425,helpful mostly
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3426,"It sounds like smoking feels like a reliable tool in your stress-management toolkit. At the same time, I'm curious if there are any aspects of smoking that you feel differently about, or any other feelings you experience around it?"
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3427,It smells bad
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3428,"That’s an interesting contrast—you find it helpful for stress, but you also experience the downside of the unpleasant smell. It's common to have these mixed feelings. How do you balance these conflicting thoughts, or does one feeling weigh heavier than the other?"
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3429,not really
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3430,"It seems like the helpful aspect of smoking when it comes to managing stress has been quite influential for you so far, even if there's that downside with the smell. How do you see this playing out in the future, especially as you think about stress management and positivity in your life?"
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3431,less smoking as life improvees
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3432,You envision a future where smoking might naturally decrease as things in your life get better and stressors change. It sounds like you see a connection between your life circumstances and how often you smoke. Are there certain improvements or changes you’re thinking about or working towards that could influence this?
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3433,cutting back

115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3435,1 less a day
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3436,"That's a practical start—reducing by one cigarette a day. Even small steps can lead to significant progress over time. Would you like to discuss any strategies or support that might be helpful as you take this step, or is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about right now?"
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,client,3437,not really
115,6672ebed0a2fc6fd8ad014c7,counsellor,3438,"Thank you for taking the time to share with me today. We've reached the end of our session, so I'd like to summarize what we've talked about. You've been navigating some stress, especially around finances and family, and have found solace in early morning walks that provide clarity and contemplation. You're working on maintaining a positive mindset by focusing on thankfulness and smiling through tough times. While smoking has been a tool for managing stress when you don't have time for exercise, you've expressed some mixed feelings about it, particularly regarding its smell. You've noted that as life improves, you aim to cut back on smoking, starting with just one less cigarette a day. These are all great insights and steps you've shared today, and it sounds like you’re moving toward changes that align with your aspirations. If you ever feel like exploring these topics further or need support, feel free to reach out. Take care, and I wish you the best on your journey."
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3439,"Hello there! I hope you're doing well today. I'm glad you've taken this step to have a conversation about smoking. When you're ready, I'd love to hear a bit about your experiences with smoking and what brings you here today. Just take your time and share whatever you're comfortable with."
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3440,"My experience with smoking gives me a sense of calm, followed by lingering guilt."
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3441,"It seems like smoking brings you a sense of calm, but it also leaves you dealing with feelings of guilt afterward. It must be tough to deal with those two opposing feelings. Could you tell me more about what the calm and the guilt mean to you?"
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3442,Calm to me might be a moment of peace and guilt on the other hand is a feeling of doing something wrong.
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3443,"So smoking gives you a moment of peace, a break from whatever might be going on. But then there's a sense of wrongdoing afterward that weighs on you. It's a bit like seeking refuge but having it come at a cost. How do these feelings of peace and wrongdoing affect your thoughts about smoking?"
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3444,The feeling of peace and wrongdoing against myself leads to thoughts of breaking free from this habit.
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3445,"You're recognizing that while smoking gives you a temporary peace, the guilt that follows pushes you to think about breaking free from the habit. It sounds like there's a part of you that wants change. What does breaking free mean to you?"
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3446,It means having a sense of control.
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3447,So breaking free represents regaining control over your life and choices. That sounds really empowering. What are the things in your life that you would like to have more control over right now?
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3448,Self awareness is a big part of this for me.
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3449,Gaining self-awareness is incredibly important to you. It's like understanding your actions and connecting with who you truly are. How do you see increasing your self-awareness relating to your smoking habit?
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3450,A high sense of awareness is the key to unlock or take back your power.
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3451,"For you, increasing self-awareness is crucial in taking back your power and control. It's as if being more conscious and aware can help you make choices that align with what you truly want. How do you see this new mindset influencing your thoughts or actions related to smoking?"
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3452,This mindset will help me make the right decisions in relation to smoaking.
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3453,You believe that this heightened awareness can guide you toward making the right decisions regarding smoking. It's like having a clearer path forward. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss related to this or anything else on your mind today?
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3454,No
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,counsellor,3455,"Thank you so much for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to reflect on what we discussed. We've talked about how smoking gives you a brief sense of calm but is quickly followed by guilt, which drives you to think about breaking free from the habit. You mentioned that breaking free represents regaining control and increasing your self-awareness. You believe that heightened awareness is crucial for making the right decisions about smoking, aligning with who you truly want to be. I appreciate you for sharing your insights, and please know that I'm here to support you on your journey.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
116,66f9b99f230e80e70676f4ab,client,3456,No
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3457,Hello! Thanks for joining me today. It's really great to have this opportunity to talk with you. How have you been doing lately?
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3458,Fine thanks.
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3459,I'm glad to hear that. Have there been any recent experiences or situations that you feel have been on your mind lately? Anything that you'd like to share as we begin our conversation today?
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3460,Nothing that I can think of.
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3461,"That's perfectly okay. We can take things at your pace. Since we're here to discuss things that may be important to you, I'm curious—how do you feel about your smoking habits these days?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3462,"Well, I feel a bit alienated as it is not very popular with some people."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3463,"That sounds challenging, feeling alienated in certain social settings. It must be hard when what you do isn't fully accepted by others. How do those feelings of alienation affect your thoughts or actions around smoking?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3464,I feel a bit guilty when I smoke.
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3465,That guilt seems to come from a place of social pressure and maybe even internal conflict. It's like a part of you is saying that smoking might not align with what you want for yourself or how you wish to be seen by others. How do you handle those feelings when they come up?
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3466,I try and put them out of my mind as much as possible.
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3467,"You try to push those feelings aside, which might help temporarily, but they seem to linger in the background. It's a tough place to be, feeling that conflict inside. What do you think might happen if those feelings were less easy to put aside?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3468,"I would just continue to feel the feelings of guilt I assume as I am now, but it would not effect me too much."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3469,Sounds like you're managing to keep the guilt at a tolerable level for now. It’s interesting that guilt doesn’t seem to have a huge impact on your everyday actions with smoking. What do you think it would take for things to change in a way that might affect your smoking?
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3470,"Well, maybe if it was just me who smoked, but it is not and many of my friends smoke, so we tend to support each other."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3471,"Having friends who smoke and that support network can make it feel more normal or acceptable, even if there are some conflicting feelings. It's like having a shared experience that creates a bond. How does this shared experience with your friends impact your thoughts about potentially making a change in your smoking habits?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3472,"Smoking can be social activity where we all meet up and talk, so it could effect that activity maybe."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3473,"It’s interesting how smoking has become a social connector for you and your friends, almost like a routine that brings you together. Changing that habit might shift how you all interact. How important is it for you to maintain those social connections, and do you think there are alternative ways you might consider maintaining them?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3474,"Yes, as obviously social media is prevalent and widely used, but nothing is quite like the personal contact, so it is quite an important part of my day."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3475,"The personal contact with your friends during those smoking meet-ups is really valuable to you, offering a unique and meaningful connection. It's a significant part of your day. As you think about this, are there ways you're curious about how you could keep that important connection, even if you chose to explore changes in your smoking habits?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3476,The group have discussed stopping smoking so maybe a group effort is needed.
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3477,Considering a group effort to stop smoking—there's something powerful about having that collective support and shared goal. It's as if you all can still maintain your connection while moving toward a healthier change together. How does the idea of working as a group to make a change make you feel?
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3478,"OK, but if we fail as a group we will be back where we started."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3479,"The possibility of not succeeding as a group is something that weighs on you a bit, thinking about ending up back at square one. It’s understandable to have concerns about that. At the same time, the idea of trying it together seems promising. What support or steps do you think could help your group, and you personally, have the best chance at success?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3480,"Not sure, I think there is help from the NHS available."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3481,"The possibility of getting support from the NHS is definitely worth exploring. It could provide resources or guidance that might help your group effort. It sounds like there's an interest in looking into these kinds of support, both for you as a group and individually. How do you feel about taking steps to learn more about what's available and then sharing it with your friends?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3482,"Yes, I could do that but would not want to feel like I was putting pressure on people."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3483,"You want to respect your friends' choices while exploring the possibility of change, finding a balance between sharing information and ensuring it doesn't feel like pressure. It sounds like you value maintaining your friendships and autonomy. If you feel it's right, there might be a way to open the conversation that feels supportive rather than pushy. Is there anyone in your group you think would be open to discussing exploring these supports together?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3484,"I think everyone is approachable, that is why we are friends, it just takes the right way of doing it, at the right moment."
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3485,"Approaching your friends in the right way at the right moment, considering their openness, is something you're thoughtful about. It's nice to see how you value your friendship's dynamics. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore further?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3486,I have been vaping more lately and thought this was a step in the right direction.
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,counsellor,3487,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's go over what we've touched upon: We talked about the feelings of guilt that sometimes accompany your smoking, along with the social aspects and connections it brings with your friends. You've considered the idea of exploring change as a group, perhaps looking into NHS resources, but you're mindful of not wanting to pressure others. You've also been vaping more recently, viewing it as a positive step forward. It's clear you're considering various aspects of your smoking habits and how they fit into your life and relationships. I appreciate your openness and the chance to explore these topics with you today. If you want to discuss more or revisit anything in the future, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
117,5bad01517e61b90001d36181,client,3488,No
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3489,Hi there! It's great to have you here today. How's your day been so far?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3490,Not bad
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3491,I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to listen and support you. Is there anything specific on your mind today?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3492,Just stressed
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3493,That sounds tough. Stress can be really challenging to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your stress right now?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3494,The fact that I am trying to find a new place to live
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3495,Moving can definitely be a stressful experience. It's a big change and often comes with a lot of uncertainty. How have you been managing this stress?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3496,I havent
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3497,"It can be overwhelming when there's so much going on. Sometimes, when stress builds up, it can feel daunting to find ways to cope. Do you find yourself reaching for cigarettes during these times, or is it something different?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3498,Yes
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3499,It sounds like smoking has become a way for you to manage the stress of everything that's happening. What are your thoughts or feelings about that?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3500,It's true
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3501,You've noticed that smoking plays a role in helping you handle stress. It sounds like an important part of your routine right now. Have you thought about any changes you might want to make in relation to smoking?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3502,I'd like to quit
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3503,"That's a significant decision, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Wanting to quit shows a lot of strength and a desire for change. What makes quitting important to you?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3504,Save money
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3505,"Saving money is definitely a big incentive. Financial reasons can really motivate change. Along with that, do you find any other reasons that drive your desire to quit?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3506,My health
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3507,Your health is a really important factor. It sounds like you're thinking about both the financial and health benefits of quitting. What kind of health changes are you hoping to see when you stop smoking?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3508,I'd like to become more in shape
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3509,"That's a fantastic goal. Being in better shape can really enhance your overall well-being and energy levels. As you think about getting in better shape, do you envision how that might make a difference in your daily life?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3510,I'll just be more opt to do things
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3511,Having more energy and motivation to engage in activities you enjoy can make a big difference in your day-to-day life. It sounds like being more active is something that’s really important to you. Is there anything else about quitting smoking that you're thinking about or want to discuss?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3512,No
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3513,"Alright, let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about today. You've shared that smoking is a way you've been managing stress, particularly with your current situation of finding a new place to live. You've expressed a desire to quit smoking for both financial and health reasons, and you envision that quitting could help you become more active and involved in things you enjoy. 

If you're feeling ready, we could discuss some steps you might want to consider towards quitting. Would you like to explore that now?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3514,Yes
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3515,"Great! Let's start by considering what might be a helpful first step for you. Some people find it useful to set a quit date, explore different quitting methods, or think about support systems they might need. What's something that feels manageable for you to begin with?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3516,Any
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3517,"Okay, there's some flexibility in how to approach this, which is a good place to be. How about starting with setting a quit date? It's a concrete step and can give you a clear goal to work towards. What do you think about picking a day in the near future that makes sense for you?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3518,Monday
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3519,"Monday sounds like a strong choice. Having that specific day can help focus your efforts and give you something to prepare for. In the days leading up to Monday, what do you think might support your success, like planning distractions, identifying triggers, or reaching out for support?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3520,I need to find a new vice
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3521,"Finding an alternative or ""vice"" can indeed be helpful in managing the times you’d usually reach for a cigarette. It could be something relaxing like taking deep breaths, or maybe a physical activity you enjoy. What kind of activities or habits have you thought about exploring as a replacement?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3522,Biting my nails
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3523,"Biting your nails could be a temporary substitute, but if you're looking for something potentially healthier, perhaps experimenting with a stress ball or having a healthy snack on hand might work. What do you think about trying out different options to see what might fit best?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3524,Maybe a game of solitare
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3525,Solitare can be a great way to keep your hands and mind busy. It's a focused activity that can help distract from urges to smoke. It's worth trying to see how it works for you when those moments come. Is there anything else you feel you might need or want to explore before Monday?
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3526,No
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3527,"Alright, it sounds like you've got a solid start with the plan to quit smoking on Monday and using Solitaire as a helpful distraction. Remember, each step you take is a move towards the positive changes you’re aiming for. I'm here to support you through this process, so feel free to reach out if you need anything. How are you feeling about taking this big step?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3528,Good
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3529,"That's wonderful to hear. It shows that you're ready to make this positive change. Remember, it's perfectly okay to reach out for support or talk through any challenges along the way. Wishing you strength as you move forward. I look forward to hearing how things go. Take care!"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3530,Thank you
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,counsellor,3531,"Thank you for the conversation today. Let's go over what we've talked about so far. You've shared that smoking has been a way to cope with stress, especially with the challenge of finding a new place to live. Despite the stress, you have a strong desire to quit smoking, motivated by financial savings and improving your health and fitness. You've chosen Monday as your quit date and have considered engaging in activities like playing Solitaire to serve as a distraction from smoking. It's clear you're committed to taking this important step for your well-being. Wishing you the best on your journey and I'm here if you need further support!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
118,6726175b381af01a5aaef18a,client,3532,No
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3533,Hello there! It's great to see you today. How are you doing? Is there anything specific on your mind that you'd like to start with?
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3534,I am okay
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3535,"I'm glad to hear you're okay. We can take things at your own pace. If there's anything you'd like to talk about or explore, feel free to share. How has your day been so far?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3536,My day has been just okay. let's delve rightinto the smoking bit
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3537,"Absolutely, we can dive into that. Smoking can be a complex part of life with mixed feelings around it. How do you feel about your smoking habits right now?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3538,"well, I am not highly addicted to it but quitting is a bit difficult"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3539,"It sounds like you're feeling somewhat caught in between—a part of you not feeling highly dependent, yet finding it tough to quit. What's it like for you when you think about stopping smoking altogether?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3540,"All my friends smoke, in fact we go out to smoke together. I do that with my partner and brother also"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3541,"It sounds like smoking is more than just a habit; it's also a social activity for you, deeply connected to your relationships with friends, your partner, and your brother. How do you feel about smoking being such a shared experience with the people close to you?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3542,We bond over that. We have a good time
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3543,"It seems like those moments are meaningful and enjoyable for you, adding a layer of connection with the people you care about. At the same time, have you ever thought about any aspects of smoking that you might not be entirely comfortable with?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3544,I wanna replace smoking with healthy habits but still share the same bond with my people
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3545,That desire to maintain those cherished connections while shifting toward healthier habits is meaningful and important. You're looking for a way to keep the social bond strong without relying on smoking. Have you considered any specific healthy activities that might fit into your social circle and foster that same sense of connection?
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3546,I am thinking we have games nights with just healthy drinks. But I highly doubt they will agree with me on that
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3547,"You're exploring an interesting and healthy idea with game nights and keeping the drinks healthy, which sounds like a creative way to maintain connection. It's understandable to have some doubts about how your friends might react. How do you feel about sharing this idea with them, and are there any small steps you think could help make the proposal more appealing to them?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3548,I'm thinking maybe making the conscious effort not to smoke in their presence and when they ask me why I explain it to them.
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3549,"That sounds like a thoughtful approach, leading by example and using it as an opportunity to share your journey when the topic comes up naturally. It could open up a conversation where you express what's important to you, and who knows, they might even be interested in exploring these changes with you. How do you feel about starting with this step?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3550,Yeah I would try that.
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3551,That sounds like a positive step toward the changes you're interested in making. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to discuss regarding smoking or any other area you'd like support with?
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3552,Thank you for that
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3553,"You're very welcome. I'm glad we could talk about this today. Remember, you're not alone on this journey, and I'm here to support you at any step along the way. Feel free to reach out whenever you need to talk or need guidance. Take care!"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3554,Awesome!
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3555,"Thank you for the conversation today. We've explored some important aspects of your relationship with smoking—how it's not only a habit but also a social activity that you share with friends, your partner, and your brother. You expressed a desire to replace smoking with healthier habits while maintaining those valuable bonds. We talked about the idea of group game nights with healthy drinks and your plan to lead by example with clear communication to your friends. This approach is a great way to initiate a change that supports your health while staying connected to those around you. I'm here if you need anything along the way.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3556,"Yes, let's continue."
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,counsellor,3557,"Great! As we keep talking, is there anything more you'd like to explore or focus on today related to smoking, or are there other aspects of your life where you're seeking change or support?"
119,66b19980c3c58c2bba58922e,client,3558,No
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3559,Hi there! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling as we begin our conversation?
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3560,Ok
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3561,"Thank you for sharing. It's completely okay to feel however you're feeling right now. Since this is our first session, I’d love to get to know a bit more about you. Would you be comfortable sharing a little about what brought you here today?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3562,a HIT on prolific
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3563,Thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to know what brought you here. It sounds like you're looking for support today. Is there anything specific that's on your mind related to smoking or anything else you'd like to discuss?
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3564,"Uhm, not that I can think of. Aren't you supposed to be helpful?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3565,"Absolutely, I'm here to support you. Sometimes, it can be helpful to explore how we feel about certain habits, like smoking. It's common to have mixed feelings about it. How do you feel about your smoking habits right now?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3566,I feel ok about them.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3567,"I hear you. You're feeling alright about your smoking habits at the moment. Sometimes, there's a lot more under the surface when we think or talk about smoking. Has anything happened recently that made you reflect on your smoking, or does it feel like just a regular part of your life right now?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3568,It is a regular part of my life.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3569,"Smoking seems to have settled into your daily routine. Sometimes, people might have mixed emotions even when something feels routine. I’m curious, do you ever find yourself thinking about anything you like or dislike about smoking?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3570,the cost. However I feel that way about everything.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3571,"The cost of smoking is something that's on your mind, and it sounds like this concern extends to other parts of your life as well. Balancing costs can be challenging. How do you think the cost of smoking affects your overall budget, compared to other expenses?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3572,Minimally.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3573,"So, at this point, it doesn't feel like smoking has a major impact on your budget. It's interesting how factors like cost can sometimes weigh differently for us over time. Is there anything else about your smoking habit that you think about, whether it's something you enjoy or something you find challenging?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3574,I enjoy it very much. It is one of relatively few things that I look forward to daily.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3575,"Smoking brings you a lot of enjoyment and serves as something to look forward to each day, which can be quite significant. Having those moments of pleasure is important, especially if they're in short supply. What do you think it is about smoking that brings you that enjoyment?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3576,The effect nicotine has on my brain.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3577,Nicotine seems to bring about an effect on your brain that you find pleasurable and enjoyable. It's interesting how chemical reactions can create such impactful experiences. Do you find that this effect helps you in any specific situations or moments during your day?
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3578,"Yes, always."
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3579,"It sounds like nicotine provides a consistent effect that supports you throughout your day. Having something that feels reliable can be quite comforting. Given this positive impact, do you ever find yourself weighing the benefits of smoking against any concerns, or is the enjoyment it provides your main focus right now?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3580,I'm content with my smoking as I reduced it significantly already.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3581,"It's wonderful that you've already made changes to reduce your smoking and feel content with where you're at now. That reflects a strength and ability to adapt when needed. Balancing contentment with any changes we've made can be very fulfilling. Is there anything you went through to reduce your smoking that you felt was particularly helpful, or any insights you gathered from the process?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3582,I started vaping mostly instead. cheaper and probably healthier.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3583,"You've found vaping to be an effective way to reduce your smoking, perceiving it as a cheaper and potentially healthier alternative. It sounds like you've reflected on your options and made choices that align with your preferences and goals. Is vaping giving you the same satisfaction that smoking did, or has the change affected your experience in any way?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3584,"not quite, but its better indoors."
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3585,"While vaping may not fully match the satisfaction you found in smoking, it offers a practical advantage of being more suitable for indoor use. It seems like you've found a middle ground that works for you in different situations. Is there anything else relating to smoking or vaping that you'd like to explore or discuss today?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3586,Nope.
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,counsellor,3587,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's summarize what we've talked about. You've shared that smoking is a regular part of your life and brings you enjoyment, especially noting the effect nicotine has on your brain. Cost is something you've thought about, though it hasn't had a significant impact on your budget. You’ve successfully reduced your smoking by transitioning to vaping, which feels like a cheaper and potentially healthier option, and while it might not completely match the satisfaction of smoking, it offers advantages like indoor use. It's great to hear about the changes you've made and the reflection you’ve done around these habits. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss in the future, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
120,6517301b6d21d25e19c7e501,client,3588,No
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3589,Hi there! It's great to see you today. How are you feeling about our session?
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3590,Optimistic
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3591,That’s wonderful to hear. Optimism can be a great start for discussions like these. What would you like to focus on during our time today?
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3592,"Well, I suppose to find ways to help me quit smoking"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3593,"That's an important goal, and I'm here to support you through it. Quitting smoking can be a significant change, sometimes with mixed feelings attached. What are your thoughts or feelings about smoking right now?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3594,I hate it but I have done it for so long that it's second nature to me. A bad habit I have a difficult time putting down
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3595,"It’s understandable to feel that way after having it as a part of your routine for so long. On one hand, you dislike smoking, but on the other, it feels like an ingrained habit. What do you think makes it particularly challenging to set aside?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3596,"The hand to mouth, the inhaling sensation."
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3597,"It sounds like there's something comforting about the physical aspects of smoking, like the hand-to-mouth action and the sensation of inhaling. Those habits can become quite familiar over time. Have you noticed any particular situations or feelings when you're more drawn to smoking?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3598,"Stressful moments, social moments, after eating, and when waking up"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3599,"So, it seems smoking plays different roles at different times for you: a way to cope with stress, a social activity, and perhaps part of certain routines like after eating or waking up. How do you feel about the role smoking has in these moments?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3600,I feel constricted and feel as if I'm a prisoner
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3601,"That sounds really tough. Feeling like you're imprisoned by smoking in these moments can be overwhelming. It's clear that you're aware of how smoking impacts your life. We're acknowledging these feelings, which is an important step. What do you envision life might be like without smoking as part of it?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3602,"I probably would begining to feel better, smell better...not stink. I have COPD so that would start to improve"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3603,"Imagining those positive changes—feeling better, enjoying fresh smells, improving your condition like COPD—seems significant and motivating. It sounds like you really value the potential health benefits and quality of life improvements. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or mention about smoking and its impact on your life?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3604,"The cost, even though most of the time I smoke roughly 5 a day and a pack can at times last 4-5 days, it still costs $11 every time I purchase a pack. That adds up. I could save that and buy something"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3605,"The cost is another important factor, and it sounds like you're thinking about the financial impact over time. Saving that money could indeed open up other possibilities. You're considering so many aspects of this, from health to finances. Before we move forward, is there anything else weighing on your mind about smoking or any other factors we haven't touched upon yet?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3606,no
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3607,"You've shared a lot about your thoughts and feelings regarding smoking. Let's summarize some of the key things we've discussed: you want to quit smoking, you're feeling constrained by it, and you're hopeful about potential health improvements and financial savings. Would it be alright to talk about steps you might take toward change?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3608,Sure
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3609,"Great! With all that you've shared, what do you think might be a first small step you'd like to take toward reducing or quitting smoking?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3610,I am not sure
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3611,"It's okay if you're not sure just yet. Sometimes breaking things down into smaller, more manageable steps can be helpful. What if we explore some ideas together and see if anything feels possible or interesting to you?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3612,Absolutely
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3613,"One approach could be to start by noticing and keeping track of when you smoke each day. This can help identify patterns or triggers. Another idea might be exploring different activities or techniques to manage stress or replace the hand-to-mouth motion. Does any of this resonate with you, or is there a particular direction you'd like to explore first?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3614,"replacing the hand to mouth, without it being food."
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3615,"That's a great focus. Finding alternatives to the hand-to-mouth motion might really help. Some people find success with things like chewing gum, using a stress ball, or holding a small object like a fidget spinner. Would you like to try experimenting with some of these options?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3616,Sure
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3617,That sounds like a positive step forward. You can try out a few different things and see what feels best for you. It’s all about finding what works to make that transition a bit easier. How do you feel about starting with this experiment for the week and seeing how it goes?
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3618,"Okay, I think I can manage that. I will find a small object to fiddle with when I'm needing a cigarette"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3619,"That sounds like a solid plan, and it's wonderful that you're willing to give it a try. We'll check in again to see what you noticed, what worked, and what might need adjusting. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. How can I support you best as you begin this step?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3620,Im not sure
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3621,"That's perfectly okay. We'll figure it out together. As you experiment with this new approach, you can always reach out if you need encouragement or want to discuss how things are going. Whatever you need, I'm here to support you. When would you like to reconnect to review your progress and talk about what you've learned?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3622,When would be best for the progress?
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3623,"We can aim to reconnect in about a week, or whenever feels comfortable for you, to discuss how the alternative approach is going. It's often helpful to have a bit of time to notice any patterns or challenges. Does a week from now sound good for you?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3624,"Yes, a week sounds good to me."
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,counsellor,3625,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me today. I want to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You’ve expressed a strong desire to quit smoking because it makes you feel constricted and like a prisoner. You've considered benefits such as feeling and smelling better, improving your COPD, and reducing costs. We also explored different smoking triggers, like stress and social situations, and you identified the hand-to-mouth action as a challenge. I'm glad you’re willing to experiment with alternatives like using a small object to replace that motion. We’re planning to reconnect in a week to see how this step is going. If you ever need support in the meantime, I'm here for you. I appreciate your openness and commitment today, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this journey unfolds for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
121,65c23bf7904812607642bad6,client,3626,No
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3627,Hello! Welcome to our session today. How are you feeling as we start this conversation?
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3628,I'm feeling calm
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3629,"That's a nice way to begin our conversation today. I'm glad to hear you're feeling calm as we chat. Is there any particular reason you're feeling this way today, or anything on your mind you'd like to explore?"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3630,I'm more relaxed at the weekend
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3631,"Weekends can definitely bring a sense of relaxation and relief from the usual hustle and bustle. I'm glad you're able to enjoy this time. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about today, perhaps related to your weekend routine or anything that's been on your mind recently?"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3632,I am delighted that the most excellent Donald Trump won the US election
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3633,I can see that you feel strongly about this and it brings you joy. It’s good to find something that sparks such a positive feeling. How has this event influenced you or your life recently?
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3634,it's been great fun watching the left have meltdowns
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3635,It sounds like you've found some entertainment and perhaps a sense of satisfaction in observing the reactions to the election outcome. It seems like this topic brings you some amusement. Is there anything else happening in your life that you'd like to explore or insights you'd like to share today?
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3636,I am trying to lose some weight
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3637,"It's great that you're focusing on your health and considering weight loss. That can be quite a journey with ups and downs. What's motivating you to pursue this change, and how has the process been going for you so far?"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3638,Prime motivation is just general fitness and health
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3639,Focusing on fitness and health is a positive and powerful motivator. It seems like you're valuing your well-being and looking ahead towards a healthier lifestyle. How does smoking fit into this picture of health and fitness for you?
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3640,"well I think it's obvious it would be better to not smoke but I smoke less, which is a start"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3641,"It sounds like you're already taking some steps toward smoking less, which is a meaningful change. It's impressive that you're reflecting on the benefits of further cutting back. What has helped you to smoke less already, and what do you think might be your next step in this journey?"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3642,I've tried some vaping instead
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3643,"Exploring vaping as an alternative shows you're actively seeking ways to reduce smoking, which is an important part of the process. How has your experience been with vaping so far? Are there parts of it you find helpful or any challenges that you're encountering?"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3644,"it's different but I'm getting used to it, it isn;t as addictive"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3645,"You're noticing a difference with vaping, and it seems like you're adjusting to the change. It's interesting that you mention it's not as addictive for you. How does that impact your thoughts about continuing to reduce or possibly quitting smoking?"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3646,it encourages it
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3647,That's encouraging to hear. It seems like vaping has provided a pathway that supports your desire to cut down further or even quit smoking. Is there anything else about your experience with vaping or your journey with reducing smoking that you'd like to reflect on or explore further?
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3648,I think that's enough for now
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,counsellor,3649,"Thank you for the conversation today. Before we end, I'd like to summarize what we've talked about. You mentioned that you're feeling calm, particularly over the weekend, and have found some enjoyment in recent events, like the election. We also discussed your focus on health and fitness, which is motivating you to consider changes in your smoking habits. You've made strides by smoking less and have tried vaping, which you find less addictive and encouraging toward reducing smoking further. It's been insightful hearing about your journey, and I appreciate you sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
122,62db2644ab0a3a353c0dcb54,client,3650,No
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3651,Hello! It's great to meet you. How are you doing today?
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3652,I'm ok. I've had a relaxing day so far.
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3653,"That sounds nice, a bit of relaxation can really make a difference in our day. Is there anything in particular that has helped you feel more relaxed today?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3654,It's the weekend so I've just been enjoying not being at work.
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3655,Weekends can be such a great time to unwind and recharge after a busy week. It sounds like you're really appreciating that break from work. Is there anything else you've found yourself thinking about or focusing on during this downtime?
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3656,I haven't done much of anything to do. I've been hanging out with my dogs. I read for a bit. Took a nap. I'm going to buy groceries later on so I've been making a shopping list.
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3657,"Spending time with your dogs, reading, and napping all sound really soothing. It seems like you're making the most of your time off. And even errands like grocery shopping can be part of a balanced, peaceful day. Since we're here for a conversation today, is there anything particular on your mind that you’d like to explore or talk about?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3658,I would like to talk about quitting smoking. I really want to quit. I'm getting older and I'm starting to feel the physical side effects of smoking on my health. I really hate spending money and time
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3659,"It sounds like you're really feeling the impact that smoking is having on different aspects of your life, both physically and financially. You're expressing a strong desire for change, which is an important step. How do you feel when you think about the idea of quitting smoking and the potential benefits it could bring?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3660,I feel happy when I think about being a non-smoker. I feel like my life would be so much more free without always having to make sure I have cigarettes and somewhere to smoke.
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3661,Imagining a life free from the constraints of smoking seems to bring you a sense of happiness and freedom. It sounds like you value the idea of not having to plan around cigarettes and the potential that change could unlock. What do you think makes that vision of being a non-smoker so appealing to you?
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3662,I think of myself as independent so I don't like that I am so dependent on cigarettes. I also just want to be free to enjoy movies or walks or any activity without thinking about when I can smoke next
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3663,"You really value your independence, and the idea of smoking taking away from that sense of self seems to weigh heavily on you. The thought of engaging in activities freely, without the constant planning around smoking, sounds like a really attractive and liberating change for you. What do you think has kept you smoking despite these feelings of dependence?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3664,I just don't have any belief in myself that I can quit. I feel like I don't have any willpower or discipline.
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3665,"It's really tough to doubt your own ability to change, especially when it comes to something as challenging as quitting smoking. You're acknowledging some real internal barriers, like concerns about willpower and discipline. Yet, the very fact that you're here, exploring these feelings and considering change, reflects a strong sense of commitment and courage. How do you think you might be able to build that belief in yourself going forward?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3666,My mom and my sister have both quit smoking so I am trying to look to their example to show me that I can do it.
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3667,"Drawing inspiration from your mom and sister's success is a wonderful way to see what's possible for you. It shows that you have role models who have walked this path, and their experiences can be a source of strength and encouragement. How does it feel to know that you have those examples in your life?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3668,"It feels good to know that I have my sister's support to lean on. When I quit, I can talk to her and get advice. Unfortunately, my mom passed from COVID-19. She had COPD so I know how bad smoking is."
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3669,"I'm truly sorry to hear about your mom's passing. It sounds like you're carrying the weight of losing her while also recognizing the serious impacts smoking can have on health, like COPD. Having your sister to support and guide you is a significant resource, especially as someone who has been through it herself. How does your mom's experience affect your motivation and feelings about quitting smoking?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3670,"I don't want to suffer the way my mom did. Even though I have been smoking for thirty years, I still feel like I can improve my health if I quit now."
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3671,"You're reflecting on your mom's experience and realizing the importance of taking a step towards better health, even after years of smoking. It's empowering to recognize that it's not too late to make a positive change. With your determination and the support of your sister, you're setting the stage for a healthier future. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about before we consider thinking about next steps?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3672,No
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3673,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let me summarize our conversation. You've mentioned how weekends are a relaxing time for you, and you've been spending it in enjoyable ways, like being with your dogs and preparing for your week. You've expressed a strong desire to quit smoking due to concerns about the impact on your health, especially in light of your mother's experience with COPD. You really value independence and feel that smoking is compromising that, which is motivating you to seek change. You're also inspired by your sister's successful journey in quitting smoking, and you aim to use her support as a resource. Despite your concerns about willpower, you're aware that taking this step could significantly improve your health, even after many years of smoking.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3674,"Yes, let's continue."
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3675,"Great! Thank you for your openness so far. Now that we've talked through some of your thoughts and feelings, would you like to explore some possible next steps or strategies to help you move towards quitting smoking?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3676,yes please
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3677,"Alright, let's start by considering what you've found to be helpful or comforting when you're facing challenges. Is there a past experience where you've successfully made a change or overcome a difficulty, and what tools or strategies did you use then that might apply here?"
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,client,3678,I guess this is the reason I have doubts about my willpower. I can't think of any time I've overcome a difficulty. I've never really been successful at quitting anything except for college and jobs.
123,66d8e4c119fbcd2677d4eeba,counsellor,3679,"Thank you for our time together today. We've reached the end of our conversation for now, and I’d like to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. 

You've shared how weekends give you a chance to relax and enjoy activities like spending time with your dogs and reading. You've expressed a strong desire to quit smoking, driven by concerns about your health and the memory of your mom's struggle with COPD. You see your sister's experience as a beacon of hope and support in this journey. 

We talked about your sense of independence and your desire to not feel controlled by cigarettes. You also acknowledged some feelings of doubt regarding your willpower, although your willingness to engage in this conversation already shows a level of commitment and openness to change. We've touched on beginning to look at past experiences where you might have used different strategies or tools to face difficult challenges. 

I appreciate your honesty and courage in sharing these thoughts and feelings today. When you're ready, we can continue exploring together how you can take steps toward the freedom and health you envision. Take care, and I look forward to talking with you again."
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3680,Hello there! Welcome to our session together. How are you doing today?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3681,my day feels good
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3682,I'm glad to hear that! It's always nice to have a good day. What's been going well for you?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3683,Just relaxing and having food to eat
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3684,That sounds really nice and comforting. Taking time to relax and enjoy a meal can really make a day special. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about today?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3685,no
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3686,"That's completely okay. We can take things at your pace. If anything comes to mind or if there's something you'd like to explore later on, just let me know. If you don't mind, we could discuss how things are going for you with smoking, if that's something you're open to sharing?"
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3687,yes dicuss about the smoking
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3688,Thank you for being open to that. Could you share with me what your smoking looks like right now? What role does it play in your day-to-day life?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3689,I am an active smoker. I smoke not less than 5 times a day
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3690,Thanks for sharing that with me. It sounds like smoking is a regular part of your day. How do you feel about the place smoking holds in your life right now?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3691,I feel scared abouts its effects
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3692,It sounds like there's a part of you that's concerned about the potential impact of smoking on your health. It must be tough to feel that fear. What are some of the things that worry you the most about smoking?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3693,the effect of smoking such as heart and lund cancer
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3694,"That's certainly understandable. The health risks associated with smoking, like heart disease and lung cancer, are serious concerns. It's significant that you're thinking about these things. How does this fear influence how you view your smoking, if at all?"
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3695,This makes me want to say no to smoking
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3696,It's really powerful that you're feeling the desire to say no to smoking because of these concerns. It sounds like there's a part of you that's thinking about the benefits of making a change. What would saying no to smoking mean for you and your life?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3697,it means long life and heath
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3698,Thinking about a long and healthier life is such a hopeful vision. It sounds like you're really valuing your well-being and future. What do you imagine might change for you if you were able to move towards this healthier lifestyle?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3699,I will live long and be free for deadly disease
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3700,Imagining a life where you feel free from the fear of those diseases can be very uplifting. It's like you're envisioning a future where your health and longevity are more assured. This can be incredibly motivating. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to explore before we continue talking about what steps you might want to take?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3701,no
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3702,"Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. We've talked about some really important things—your concerns about the health effects of smoking, your desire for a long and healthy life, and your motivation to say no to smoking because of these concerns. Would it be alright to start discussing some possible steps you might consider taking towards this healthier lifestyle?"
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3703,excersising and quitting smokeing early
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3704,"Those sound like really positive steps toward the healthier life you envision. Adding exercise can do wonders for your body and mind, and starting to quit smoking could bring you closer to that long and disease-free life you're aiming for. How do you feel about putting these ideas into action? Is there one you'd like to focus on first, or do you have thoughts about how you might begin?"
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3705,This is something I always practice
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3706,"It’s great to hear that you’re already practicing some aspects of exercise and considering quitting smoking. These are both important steps, and recognizing what you're already doing is important. What has been helpful for you in practicing these changes, or what would you like to build on or adjust as you continue?"
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3707,The motivating from friends encourage me to work more
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3708,"Having supportive friends can make such a difference in your journey. It sounds like their encouragement has been a key factor in staying motivated. How do you think you might continue to use their support, or are there additional ways you'd like to involve them as you work towards your goals?"
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3709,i will continue to seek their support
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3710,That sounds like a solid plan. Having their support can be really empowering and provide that extra push when you need it. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or plan around your journey towards a healthier lifestyle?
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3711,no
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,counsellor,3712,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let me summarize what we've discussed. We began by talking about your smoking and how it's a regular part of your life, but also your fears regarding its potential health effects, like heart and lung cancer. These concerns are prompting you to consider saying no to smoking to ensure a long and healthy life, free from deadly diseases. You've also mentioned that exercising and quitting smoking early are steps you aim to take, and that the support and motivation from your friends are key in driving you forward. You're already practicing aspects of these changes, and plan to continue seeking your friends' encouragement as you work toward your goals. It sounds like you're making thoughtful, positive steps toward the future you desire. If you ever want to discuss this further or explore new ideas, I'm here to support you along the way. Thank you again for sharing, and take care!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
124,664a4342cfb111168d73bdc6,client,3713,No
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3714,Hi there! It's really nice to meet you. How are you doing today? Anything interesting or noteworthy happening in your life recently that you'd like to chat about?
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3715,"i'm a bit tired, thanks. i"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3716,It sounds like you're feeling a bit worn out. Would you like to tell me more about what's been making you feel this way recently? It's important to make sure you're taking care of yourself.
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3717,i've started a masters and it's a lot of work to balance with social life and making money
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3718,"That sounds like quite a plateful—juggling a master's program, social commitments, and financial responsibilities. It's understandable to feel tired managing all those different aspects of life. How have you been coping with all this, and are there any specific challenges you're facing with balancing it all?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3719,"i'm struggling to still enjoy my social life, but i found exercise helps to destress"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3720,"It's great to hear that you've found exercise as a way to help manage stress—physical activity can be a wonderful outlet. It sounds like maintaining your social life is important to you, even amidst all these responsibilities. How does smoking fit into everything you've got going on right now?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3721,i'm smoking more socially at uni
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3722,"It sounds like smoking has become a part of your social interactions at university. In those moments, how do you feel about smoking? Are there any particular thoughts or feelings that come up for you when you smoke in those social settings?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3723,i'm conscious that it's less about me wanting the cigarette and more about the opportunity to go outside and chat with people
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3724,"It seems like smoking has become a way to connect with others and socialize, almost like a ritual to step outside and engage in conversation. How do you feel about the fact that smoking is connected more to the social interactions than the cigarette itself?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3725,like it's probably quite pointless
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3726,You're noticing that the act of smoking might not hold much value for you beyond the social aspect. It seems like you're questioning the point of it in your life. How does that realization impact the way you view your smoking habits?
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3727,"i should probably be more mindful of that and just go outside to chat without also smoking. i struggle, however, to not want a cigarette when i drink"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3728,"It's insightful to recognize that simply going outside to chat could replace the cigarette in social settings, yet it's understandable that the craving might be stronger when you're drinking. It seems like alcohol adds another layer to the habit. How do you feel about the idea of handling those situations differently, and what do you think would make it easier for you?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3729,"i mean conceptually i feel fine, but in the moment i'm quite impulsive"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3730,"In the moment, it can be challenging to resist those impulses, especially when you're in a social and relaxed setting. It sounds like there's a bit of a gap between what you'd like to do and what happens when you're caught up in those situations. What do you think could help bridge that gap for you, or is there anything else you'd like to explore around these impulses?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3731,i think i could stop taking cigarettes out with me.
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3732,"That's a really practical step—choosing not to bring cigarettes with you might help reduce the temptation when you're out. You're identifying a specific action that could support the change you're considering. How do you feel about trying that, and is there anything else you'd like to reflect on or discuss as you think about making this change?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3733,"i feel fine about trying that. i also just want to save money but i keep getting free cigarettes so i think 'oh, why not'. however, i can quite easily go a week without smoking without thinking about"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3734,"It's encouraging to hear that you can go a week without smoking and that saving money is an additional motivation for you. The free cigarettes can feel like a justification, making it easy to slip back into old habits. You're aware of your ability to manage without smoking, which is a strong foundation. Is there anything else on your mind that you would like to talk about before we consider the next steps in this journey you're thinking about?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3735,"no, not really."
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3736,"Thank you for sharing with me today; it's been really helpful to explore what's been going on for you. Let's take a moment to summarize our conversation. You've been balancing a lot with your master's program and other life responsibilities, finding exercise a useful way to manage stress. Social smoking has been more about the connection with others at university than the cigarettes themselves, and you're aware of how impulses, especially when drinking, play a role in your smoking habits. You're contemplating leaving cigarettes behind when you go out as a practical step to align with your goals of not only reducing smoking but also saving money. It's also clear that you have the ability to go a week without smoking, which is quite significant. This reflection seems to be guiding your thoughts about making changes. If you'd like to explore these ideas further or make any plans, feel free to reach out anytime. Thank you again for your openness and willingness to discuss these matters today.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3737,"Yes, let's continue."
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3738,"Great, I'm glad to hear that you're open to continuing! Since you've been reflecting on some changes you'd like to make, especially around not bringing cigarettes with you while you're out, would you like to explore how you could put that into practice or address any other areas we've talked about? Perhaps we can discuss any specific challenges you foresee or additional support that might be helpful for you."
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3739,yeah i'd like to explore how to resist the temptation when i'm drunk
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3740,"Of course, that's an important area to navigate since it can be challenging when alcohol is involved. One approach might be to think of alternatives you can rely on in those moments. For example, planning different ways to engage socially without smoking, or having a buddy who's supportive of your choice not to smoke. How do these ideas sound to you, or is there something else that you think might work for you when you're in those situations?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3741,i don't have buddies who support me not smoking. all my friends are smokers
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3742,"That can make it more challenging when your friends are also smoking, as it creates an environment where smoking seems like the norm. It might take a different kind of support or strategy. Perhaps you could focus on reminding yourself of your reasons for wanting to resist when drinking. Or you might find it helpful to create small personal goals for nights out, like having a non-smoking option you enjoy, or engaging in other activities that don't involve smoking. How do you feel about trying out any of these ideas, or is there something else that would work better for you?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3743,what are some non-smoking options?
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3744,"Great question! There are several non-smoking options that you can consider, depending on what fits you best. Some people find that having something else in their hands, like holding a drink or a stress ball, can help with the habit of holding a cigarette. Chewing gum or having mints can keep your mouth busy. Engaging in conversation or focusing on an activity, like games or dancing, can also distract from the urge to smoke. If it appeals to you, you could explore a new hobby or interest that keeps your hands or mind occupied during social events. Do any of these options seem like something you'd want to try, or is there another approach you'd like to consider?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3745,i don't really like the sound of any of that. can you suggest something different?
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3746,"Of course, let's think about other possibilities. Perhaps connecting with people through interesting conversations where you take the lead and engage others can be a way to stay focused on the interaction rather than smoking. You might also think about setting specific intentions before you go out, like keeping track of how many non-smoking nights you accomplish and rewarding yourself with something meaningful to you. Sometimes redirecting the focus to something you're passionate about discussing or doing can naturally shift attention away from smoking. How do these ideas resonate with you?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3747,"i like the idea of rewarding myself. since cigarettes are so expensive, say i go four weeks without smoking, i'll buy myself an item of clothing"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3748,"That sounds like a fantastic idea! Turning the potential savings from not smoking into a reward like an item of clothing can give you something tangible and enjoyable to look forward to. It ties your progress to a positive outcome beyond just the act of not smoking. How do you feel about this plan, and is there any support or further thoughts you'd like to consider to help you towards that goal?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3749,i really like this plan. i just don't know whether it will work in practice
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3750,"It's understandable to feel uncertain about how new strategies will play out in reality. You're already envisioning a positive outcome, which is a strong starting point. Maybe you could try setting smaller, incremental goals leading up to the four-week mark. Checking in on how things are going could help you stay motivated and make adjustments as needed. Is there anything specific you would like to explore to make this plan more achievable or any concerns you have about the process?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3751,"i've been smoking since i was 12, and i'm now 24. what's the likelihood i am able to quit first time round?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3752,"Quitting smoking after many years can certainly be challenging, but the most crucial factor is your readiness and motivation to make the change. It's a process that can look different for everyone. Some people are able to quit on their first attempt, while others find that it takes several tries. What's important is to learn from each experience and use that to shape your next steps. Your awareness and planning, like the reward idea, can be significant contributors to your success. If you're committed to trying, that alone increases your chances of moving closer to your goal. How do you feel about taking on this challenge, even knowing it might require persistence?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3753,i like a challenge. i'm just quite weak-willed sometimes
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3754,"It's great to hear that you enjoy a challenge! It's natural to sometimes feel doubts about willpower—motivation can fluctuate, and that's okay. Having a plan and support in place, like the reward system we're discussing, can really help maintain motivation when those doubts arise. Leaning into that challenge could be another source of strength. Remember, it's not just about willpower; it's about setting up an environment and strategies that work for you. How do you feel about tapping into your enjoyment of challenges and the support you've identified to strengthen your path forward?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3755,yeah that sounds like a good approach. do you have any tips for not self-sabotaging in the moment?
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3756,"Acknowledging potential self-sabotage is an important step, and planning for those moments can be really useful. Here are a few ideas you might consider:

1. **Pause and Reflect:** When you feel the urge, try taking a moment to pause and reflect on why you want to quit. Reminding yourself of the reasons and the reward can sometimes shift your mindset.

2. **Create Barriers:** Make it a bit harder to access cigarettes by not carrying them, which you've already thought about. This creates a pause where you can decide if you really want that cigarette.

3. **Visual Reminders:** Keep visual reminders of your goal and reward, maybe a picture of the clothing item you want to buy. Seeing it regularly can reinforce your motivation.

4. **Supportive Environment:** Consider talking with friends about your goals, even if they smoke. Some might respect your decision and choose not to offer cigarettes.

5. **Mindful Breathing:** Practice deep breathing or a quick mindful exercise to ground yourself in those moments of temptation.

What do you think about these tips, or is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or modify to suit your needs?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3757,"I really like those tips. I don't trust my friends to help me out, however. But other than that, I'll try all these things, thanks."
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3758,"I'm glad to hear that these tips resonate with you, and it's good to know your boundaries with the support you can expect. It sounds like you have a thoughtful plan in place to encourage and support yourself through this challenge. Trust in your ability to work towards these goals and remember that it's okay to take things one day at a time. If you need more support or want to explore anything further, feel free to reach out whenever you'd like. Thank you for our conversation today, and I wish you all the best on this journey. How are you feeling about moving forward from here?"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3759,"I feel very good, thank you."
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3760,"I'm really pleased to hear that you're feeling good about moving forward. You've shown a lot of insight and motivation today, which will be valuable as you take on this challenge. Remember to be kind to yourself along the way and celebrate each step you're taking. If you ever need more support or just want to chat about your progress, I'm here for you. Take care and best of luck with everything!"
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,client,3761,Bye!
125,672625ba0544ba279d6e1219,counsellor,3762,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's go over what we discussed to wrap things up. You've been managing a lot with your master's program, and exercise has been a helpful way to cope with stress. Social smoking at university has become less about the desire for the cigarette and more about social interaction. You're thinking of leaving cigarettes behind when going out as a practical measure, as well as considering a rewarding plan for yourself, like buying clothing with the savings from not smoking. We also discussed some strategies to resist temptation, especially when drinking, such as keeping visual reminders and creating barriers. You've acknowledged the challenge ahead, especially with all your friends being smokers, but your readiness and motivation to tackle this head-on are clear. If you need any more support or would like to discuss anything further down the line, feel free to reach out. Take care, and I wish you all the best on this journey toward change!

126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3770,"Excitement can be such a wonderful feeling, especially when it comes to new opportunities. With this promotion at work, does it bring any other changes or challenges you're thinking about?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3771,"no, but i just want to continue working hard and achieve great things"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3772,"You're really driven to succeed and accomplish a lot in your career, and it's inspiring. As you think about working hard and achieving more, has anything been on your mind lately that might impact your journey, like habits or routines?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3773,i guess my smoking habit
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3774,Smoking is something you're aware of that might have an impact. Can you share with me a little about your thoughts or feelings around smoking these days?
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3775,i smoke more this days like about 3-5 ciggeratte
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3776,It sounds like smoking is something that has become more frequent for you recently. What are some of the reasons you think might be contributing to that increase?
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3777,thinking and maybe it has become an habit
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3778,"It seems like smoking has become a part of your routine, especially during times of thinking or stress. On one hand, it might feel like a habit that helps you manage your thoughts, and on the other hand, you might have thoughts about how it fits into your bigger picture, like staying healthy or reaching your goals. How do you feel about the role smoking is playing in your life right now?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3779,its an habbit that makes me manage my thought
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3780,"Smoking seems to offer you a way to manage your thoughts and perhaps feel a bit calmer when things are on your mind. At the same time, you might wonder about how this habit aligns with what you want for yourself long-term. Do you find there are times when you think about what it might be like to change this habit?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3781,yes i have think about it what it will take me to quit smoking how it will reflect in me and my body
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3782,You've given some real thought to what quitting smoking might entail and how it could affect both you and your body. It sounds like this change is something you're curious about. What are some things you think might change for you if you decided to quit smoking?
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3783,physical changes emotional changes and mental changes
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3784,"It seems like you’re expecting a range of changes—physical, emotional, and mental—if you were to quit smoking. Each of these areas is important, and change often brings its own set of challenges and benefits. What do you imagine might be some of the more positive changes you'd experience in those areas?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3785,reduced risk of illness sense of achievement improved fitness
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3786,"Those are some significant positive changes you’re envisioning—lower risk of illness, a sense of achievement, and improved fitness. They seem to really highlight what might motivate you towards quitting. As you think about these potential benefits, how do you feel about the idea of making a shift away from smoking?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3787,"It's natural to have mixed feelings about making such a big shift. the potential benefits like better health, more energy, and even saving money"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3788,"You're weighing both sides of this decision. On one hand, there are meaningful benefits like better health, more energy, and financial savings, and on the other, there might be some uncertainty or challenge in moving away from a habit you've relied on. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or any other thoughts you'd like to share about your feelings toward smoking and change?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3789,no
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3790,"Thank you for our conversation today. I'll take a moment to summarize what we've discussed so far. We talked about your recent promotion at work and the excitement you feel in achieving that next step. You've also shared your thoughts about smoking, recognizing it as a habit you've been using to manage your thoughts. You're considering what might change if you quit smoking, thinking about the benefits, such as reduced health risks, a sense of achievement, improved fitness, more energy, and savings. It's clear you're reflecting on both the role smoking plays and what life might look like if you made a change. If you want to explore more or take further steps, I'm here to support you in this process.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3791,"Yes, let's continue."
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3792,"Great! Since you're open to exploring more, would it be alright if we talk more about planning some next steps or ideas for moving forward, in case you're considering making a change with your smoking habit?"

126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3794,"Thanks for being open to it. As you think about possible changes, what do you feel might be the first small step you'd be comfortable taking towards your goal of reducing or quitting smoking?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3795,by reducing the daily habit of smoking
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3796,Reducing how much you smoke daily sounds like a really manageable first step toward change. It's like you're gradually creating a pathway towards your ultimate goal. Do you have a number in mind or a specific approach you'd like to try to start reducing?
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3797,1
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3798,"That's an achievable starting point, aiming to reduce by one cigarette. It gives you a measure to track your progress and feel in control. What do you think could help support you in making this change, like certain activities, strategies, or support from others?"
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3799,always being able to work and rest
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3800,Finding a balance between work and rest sounds like a supportive strategy for reducing your smoking. It could give you the space to focus on other activities and care for yourself in ways that don’t involve smoking. How do you plan to incorporate more rest and effective work routines into your daily life?
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,client,3801,i had no idea yet
126,66704e9e669e722abcd02aa6,counsellor,3802,"That's completely okay; sometimes just understanding what you'd like to change is a strong foundation. If you don’t have any specific ideas right now, we can brainstorm together or take some time to consider how you might align your environment and routine to support your goal. If there’s anything specific you’d like guidance on in crafting that balance, I’m here to help. Would you like to explore any potential strategies or resources to support you?"

Considering hypnosis is an interesting thought; it may be different from what you've tried before. What do you think about hypnosis that makes it appealing, or how do you feel about exploring new methods at this point?"
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3815,My father used it to quit after 50 years of smoking and it worked for him
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,counsellor,3816,That's a powerful testament having seen your father successfully quit after a long time with the help of hypnosis. Seeing that positive change in someone close to you can definitely offer hope and inspiration. How does reflecting on your father's success influence your own journey in thinking about cutting back or quitting smoking?
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3817,I have pretty much try everything else that I can think of and nothing has worked

It can be discouraging when past efforts don't lead to the change you hoped for. Your willingness to keep exploring options, like hypnosis, shows your determination. What do you envision for yourself if you find a method that works and are able to reduce or quit smoking?"

These are meaningful and motivating goals. How do you think making a change in your smoking habits might support achieving this vision of yourself?"
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3821,Not sure it is rime to quit but I have tried many time over the past 30 years and nothing has stuck
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,counsellor,3822,"It's completely understandable to feel uncertain about the timing, especially after many attempts over such a long period. Acknowledging that uncertainty is important. Despite the challenges you've faced, your continued willingness to explore change speaks volumes about your resilience and commitment. What do you think might make this time different or what small steps could you consider in working toward that healthier, happier future you imagine?"
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3823,"Lots of energy healing, meditation, relaxation methods and other natural healing techniques that I believe in strongly and the power of ptyer"

With all that we've talked about, especially your interest in hypnosis and the natural healing techniques you trust, would you like to explore how you might start integrating those into your journey? Or is there anything specific about these methods you'd like to discuss more deeply?"
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3827,Nothing really comes to mind
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,counsellor,3828,"That's perfectly alright; we can take this at your pace. Sometimes just letting things settle and giving yourself time to reflect can be valuable. If any questions or thoughts come up later, we can address them then, too. Is there anything else you'd like to touch on today, related to smoking or anything else going on in your life?"
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3829,no
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,counsellor,3830,"Thank you for engaging in this conversation today. Let's summarize what we've discussed. You shared your thoughts about wanting to cut back on smoking due to financial and health concerns. You've tried various methods over the past 30 years, but nothing has stuck.

127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,counsellor,3832,"Since you've expressed readiness for change, let's gently explore how you might start moving toward that vision of being healthier, happier, and more prolific in your writing. Would you like to discuss some small, manageable steps to begin integrating some of the techniques you're interested in, like relaxation methods or meditation, into your daily life?"
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3833,no because I try to do them already. I smoke more when I am stressed and anyone would be stressed if they had what I have going on in ther=ir lives
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,counsellor,3834,"You've noticed that stress plays a significant role in your smoking habits, and with everything going on in your life, that stress is understandably heightened. Managing stress is a challenge many people face, and it's good to acknowledge how it's impacting you. Is there a particular aspect of what's going on in your life right now that you feel comfortable sharing or that you'd like to explore during our time together?"
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,client,3835,no
127,672c4935ef13e4a54fc284a9,counsellor,3836,"That's perfectly okay. Sometimes it's good to simply acknowledge what's present and give yourself space. I'm here to support you whenever you're ready to talk about anything specific or if there's any other direction you'd like to explore. If there's ever anything else on your mind or a different way I can be of help, feel free to let me know. Thank you for your openness today.

128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3845,To enquire about stopping smoking
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3846,"That's a significant step, and I'm glad you're here to talk about it. What are some of your thoughts or feelings when you think about stopping smoking?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3847,That I'd be healthier and save money
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3848,Those are really strong motivations. Being healthier and saving money are both great benefits of quitting smoking. What are some things that make it challenging for you to stop?
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3849,The cravings and stress
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3850,Cravings and stress can definitely be tough to handle. It seems like smoking has been a way for you to cope with stress. How do you feel about finding new ways to manage stress and cravings?

128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3854,Thanks for letting me know. It sounds like you're on the brink of exploring new options. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about before we move forward?
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3855,No
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3856,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's take a moment to go over what we've discussed. You've mentioned that you're interested in stopping smoking because of the health benefits and the opportunity to save money. At the same time, you've found that cravings and stress are significant challenges you face when thinking about quitting. It's great that you're interested in finding new ways to manage those cravings and stress, showing your readiness to explore different strategies. If there's ever more you'd like to dive into or other thoughts you wish to share, I'm here to support you along the way.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3857,"Yes, let's continue."
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3858,"Great! Now that we've talked about some of your motivations and the challenges, would it be alright with you if we explore some potential steps or strategies for working towards quitting smoking?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3859,Yes
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3860,"Thank you for your openness. We can start by identifying a few small steps that feel manageable to you. Are there any specific strategies you've heard about or maybe tried in the past that you'd like to consider, or would you prefer to brainstorm some new ideas together?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3861,No
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3862,"That's perfectly fine. We can definitely brainstorm some ideas together if that feels right for you. Perhaps we can start by considering some common strategies like setting a quit date, finding activities to distract from cravings, or reaching out for support. Is there any of those options that resonate with you, or is there another idea that comes to mind?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3863,Activities to distract fom cravings
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3864,Focusing on activities to distract from cravings might be a useful approach. We could think about things that you enjoy or perhaps new activities you'd be interested in trying. What are some activities you enjoy or might be interested in exploring?
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3865,I'm not sure
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3866,"That's alright. It's completely normal to feel unsure when thinking about these changes. Sometimes trying out different activities can help you discover what you truly enjoy. You might think about things like taking a walk, listening to music, or even picking up a new hobby. Does any of this sound like something you might want to try, or does it spark any other ideas?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3867,New hobby perhaps
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3868,"A new hobby could be a wonderful way to redirect your focus and energy. There are so many possibilities, from things like painting, gardening, playing a musical instrument, to something like cooking or crafting. Is there a hobby you've always wanted to explore or something that intrigues you?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3869,Not that i can think of
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3870,"That's okay. Sometimes it takes a little exploration to find something that clicks. We can think about hobbies that align with your interests, or even try something completely new and see how it feels. How about trying out a few different activities or classes in the community to see what catches your interest? It can be a fun adventure to discover a new passion. Would that be something you'd like to consider?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3871,Yeah i'd consider community classes
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3872,"That sounds like a great stepping stone! Community classes can offer a wonderful way to meet people, learn something new, and keep your mind engaged. It's exciting that you’re open to exploring this path. If you'd like, we can also discuss how you might want to arrange this or search for classes you're interested in. How would you like to proceed with this idea?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3873,See what classes interest me
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3874,"That sounds like a wise approach. Exploring different options and seeing what captures your interest can be a rewarding experience. You could look into community centers, local colleges, or even online platforms to discover a variety of classes available. Would you like any support or suggestions as you start this search, or are you comfortable exploring on your own?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3875,Comfortable exploring myself
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,counsellor,3876,"That’s great to hear. Taking the initiative to explore on your own can be empowering. Remember, this is your journey, and you're doing a fantastic job taking these steps towards change. If you ever have questions or want to discuss anything along the way, I'm here to support you. How are you feeling about the steps we've talked about today?"
128,5bb21a6ed14ec100019840fb,client,3877,Positive

129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3880,Hi there! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been lately? Anything interesting or important going on in your life that you'd like to talk about?
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3881,i am graduating soon and id love to quit smoking before the day
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3882,Congratulations on your upcoming graduation! That's an exciting milestone. It's great to hear that you'd like to quit smoking before that day. It sounds like it's an important goal for you. What motivates you to consider making this change now?
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3883,its wastefull and a bad habit
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3884,It seems like you recognize smoking as something that doesn't quite align with how you want to live your life. You're seeing it as wasteful and not the habit you want to carry forward. Has there been anything specific that's made you more aware of this recently?
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3885,seeing underage kids smoke has made me see it in a negative light
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3886,Witnessing something like that can definitely change how you view smoking. It seems like it made you reflect on your own habit and its impact. How do you feel when you think about smoking and those younger kids?
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3887,"its sad and since they still think its cool, its really hard to avoid it"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3888,"It must be tough to see that influence, especially when it's wrapped up in perceptions of being ""cool."" You're feeling that sadness––perhaps because you know the challenges it can bring and don't want them to face the same struggles. What do you think might be different for you if you were able to quit?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3889,ill be focused more on my family and i can finally start saving money
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3890,Focusing more on your family and being able to save money seem to be really important benefits you're looking forward to. It sounds like quitting would allow you to invest more in both personal and family goals. How does thinking about these positive changes influence your feelings about moving forward?
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3891,makes me want to try quitting until  i succeed
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3892,"It sounds like you're feeling a strong drive to make this change, and you're ready to keep trying until you succeed. I really admire your determination. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about before we look at ways to support you in this journey?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3893,not really thats all
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3894,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's take a moment to look back on what we've talked about. You're approaching your graduation, which is such an exciting time, and you've expressed a strong desire to quit smoking before that day arrives. Seeing underage kids smoking has opened your eyes to the downsides of the habit, and it has also strengthened your resolve to quit. You mentioned that quitting would help you focus more on your family and start saving money, which feels really significant to you. Your determination to try quitting until you succeed stands out strongly in our conversation. If you're ready, we can discuss some potential next steps together when you're feeling prepared. Let me know when or if you’d like to move forward with that.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3895,"Yes, let's continue."
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3896,"Great! With your graduation goal in mind and the motivation you've shared, we can explore some different approaches to quitting smoking. I have some ideas in mind that we could discuss, but it's important to me that you're comfortable with the direction we take. Would you like to hear about some strategies or support options that others have found helpful, or is there a particular approach you’re curious about?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3897,can you list the strategies that might be helpful
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3898,"Of course! There are several strategies that might be helpful as you consider quitting smoking:

1. **Gradual Reduction**: Cutting down on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day can sometimes make quitting feel more manageable.

2. **Setting a Quit Date**: Choosing a specific day to quit can help solidify your commitment.

3. **Behavioral Support**: Counseling or support groups can provide a space to share experiences and receive encouragement.

4. **Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)**: Options like nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges can help manage withdrawal symptoms.

5. **Medications**: Some prescription medications can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms; you would need to talk to your doctor about these.

6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help you manage cravings and stress.

7. **Identifying Triggers and Preparing Coping Strategies**: Understanding situations that make you want to smoke and finding alternative actions can be pivotal.

Do any of these options resonate with you, or would you like to explore one in more detail?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3899,i like option six
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3900,"Mindfulness and relaxation techniques can be a wonderful way to manage cravings and reduce stress. They can also help you feel more in control during challenging moments. Is there a particular practice you're interested in, or would you like some suggestions on how to get started with these techniques?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3901,yes
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3902,"Here are a few mindfulness and relaxation practices that you might find helpful:

1. **Deep Breathing**: Taking slow, deep breaths can calm your mind and body. Try inhaling slowly through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling through your mouth.

2. **Meditation**: Setting aside a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing or a calming word or phrase can increase your sense of peace.

3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: This involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up.

4. **Guided Imagery**: Visualizing a peaceful scene or situation can help redirect your thoughts and reduce stress.

5. **Yoga**: Practicing yoga can offer both physical relaxation and mental clarity, as it combines movement, breath control, and focus.

You might want to try out one or a combination of these techniques to see what works best for you. Would you like to set up a specific plan for incorporating these practices, or do you have any questions about getting started?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3903,lets set up a plan
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3904,"All right! Let's craft a plan that feels achievable for you. 

1. **Starting with Deep Breathing:** How about setting aside just 5 minutes in your day to practice deep breathing? You could begin or end your day with this, or use it whenever you feel a craving.

2. **Exploring Meditation or Guided Imagery:** Maybe try a short, guided meditation video or audio session a few times a week. There are many apps available that offer free, guided meditations ranging from 5 to 10 minutes.

3. **Incorporating Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** You could choose a time once or twice a week to practice this. It can be done when you're feeling tense or right before bed to help with relaxation.

4. **Trying Yoga:** If you're interested in this, consider looking for beginner videos online to follow along with. Start with one or two sessions a week.

5. **Journaling:** After any of these practices, you might find it helpful to jot down how you feel. It could give you insight into what's working well for you and how the practices affect your cravings or mood.

Does this plan feel like a good fit for you, or is there anything you'd like to tweak? How does it align with your daily routine?"
129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,client,3905,the plan is perfect

129,5f9197ba39d009000b3d9268,counsellor,3910,"It's understandable that procrastination can be a challenge when starting something new. Your willingness to try meditation is a great step forward. Sometimes breaking routines into smaller, manageable steps can help overcome procrastination. Perhaps starting with just a couple of minutes each day might ease you into a consistent practice.

Would you like to discuss any specific strategies for how to integrate meditation into your routine, or explore ways to stay motivated?"

130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3921,i need a change in my entire life
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3922,"You're expressing a desire for a broader change, and that's really significant. Understanding how smoking fits into that change is an important step. What does that change look like to you?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3923,it should be positive and need to focus to my growth at a personal level with no hindrance
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3924,"You're aiming for a positive direction in life, with personal growth and fewer hindrances. That's a meaningful goal. In what ways do you think cutting down or quitting smoking could support that vision?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3925,more more i have been using to smoke and the time been wasting a day i can use it to do meaningful ideas for personal growth in life
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3926,You see how the time and money spent on smoking could be directed towards things that truly matter to you and contribute to your personal growth. It sounds like you're considering more meaningful ways to invest in yourself. What would making this change mean to you personally?
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3927,life growth and success
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3928,It sounds like making this change has the potential to open doors to growth and success for you. That's a powerful vision. Is there anything else that's important to you when thinking about this change?
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3929,"yes,i need to give my family time and peace"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3930,"Your family is clearly important to you, and you want to provide them with more time and peace. That's a strong motivator and adds even more meaning to your goal of positive change. How does thinking about your family affect your thoughts on quitting smoking?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3931,just to stop being a smoking addict in the family
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3932,You want to be someone your family can rely on without the influence of smoking. That's a meaningful step for you. Would you like to explore some ideas or steps that could help you move towards this goal?
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3933,sure
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3934,"Great! Before we dive into planning, is there anything else you'd like to share or discuss? I want to make sure we cover everything that's important to you."
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3935,not at all
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3936,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. You've mentioned some important aspects of your life, like wanting to focus on personal growth, managing your time and finances better, and giving your family the time and peace they deserve. With your permission, we can begin discussing how to plan some steps forward. Would that be alright?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3937,its alright
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3938,"Wonderful! Let's think about some initial steps. One option could be setting small, manageable goals like reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke each day or finding alternatives to smoking during certain times. Another approach might be identifying specific situations or triggers that lead to smoking and planning ways to handle them differently. What feels like a good place for you to start?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3939,reduce number of cigarettes
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3940,That sounds like a practical and achievable first step. Reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke each day can help ease into the change while still making a significant impact. How do you envision tracking or managing this reduction? What might help you stay on course with this plan?
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3941,i buy afew
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3942,"Buying fewer cigarettes is a proactive way to limit how much you smoke. By controlling your supply, you're setting a solid boundary that supports your goal. How do you feel about starting with that approach, and is there any support or resources you think would help you along the way?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3943,sure
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3944,"That sounds like a good plan. Remember, I'm here to support you through this journey. If you ever need to talk or reflect on how things are going, feel free to reach out. You're taking important steps toward your goals, and that's something to be proud of. Would you like to set a time to check in on your progress, or is there anything else you'd like to explore for now?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3945,also time to smoke is a very solid idea
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3946,"Structuring specific times to smoke can create a sense of control and routine, helping to gradually lessen dependency. It sounds like you have some strong ideas about how to move forward. We can check in on how these strategies are working for you. Would you like to set a follow-up, or is there anything else on your mind right now?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3947,nothing
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,counsellor,3948,"Thank you for the conversation today. I want to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. We've talked about your desire to quit smoking, the impact of smoking on your time, finances, and comfort at work, as well as your vision for personal growth and success. You expressed your aim to provide more time and peace for your family. We explored the idea of reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke by buying fewer and considering the timing of when you smoke. These steps are significant towards minimizing smoking in your life. We also discussed the possibility of checking in on your progress. If there’s anything more you’d like to add or discuss in the future, I'm here for you. Otherwise, feel free to reach out whenever you're ready.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
130,6728c72baf48cae9e61e2400,client,3949,No
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3950,Hi there! It's great to have you here for our session today. How are you feeling as we get started?
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3951,I am good
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3952,I'm glad to hear that you are good. Thanks for coming in today. I'm here to listen and support you with anything you want to talk about. Where would you like to begin our conversation?
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3953,Why I should stop smoking
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3954,"That's a really important topic to explore. It sounds like you have some thoughts about stopping smoking, but there might be some mixed feelings about it. Can you tell me more about what's on your mind regarding smoking?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3955,I dont smoke much only 2 sticks in the morning and 2 at the night before I sell
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3956,"So, you have a routine with smoking about four sticks a day. It seems like these specific times might play a role in your day-to-day activities. How do you feel about this routine, and what makes you think about stopping?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3957,I am cool with it and i dont think it too heavy for me
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3958,"You feel comfortable with your current smoking routine, seeing it as not too heavy or burdensome for you. What interests you about the idea of stopping, even though you're cool with the way things are right now?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3959,I feel well whenever I take it. In the morning before go to bed and before i go to bed to have a good sleep
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3960,"You find that smoking helps you feel well and sets a good start and end to your day, almost like a bit of a ritual that brings some comfort. What are some other thoughts or feelings you might have when you consider the idea of not having those cigarettes at those times?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3961,How I feel like at work or how best I can sleep?
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3962,You’re wondering how you might feel during work or how well you could sleep without those cigarettes. It seems like there are concerns about how stopping might impact your daily life and routine. What do you think might be different if you didn’t have those cigarettes at those times?
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3963,well I have not tried to abstain from it yet to know how it will look like for me
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3964,"You haven't tried cutting back or stopping yet, so it's still uncertain how it would actually affect your routine and the way you feel at work or when trying to sleep. It's understandable to have questions about how those changes might play out. What do you feel might be helpful in understanding or addressing these questions for yourself?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3965,May a trial for a day or two to stop smoking and experience what it will look like
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3966,"Considering a trial for a day or two to see how it feels sounds like an interesting approach. It's a way to gather some insight without committing to anything long-term right away. How do you imagine preparing for this trial period, and what support might you need to feel more comfortable trying it out?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3967,i can think of anything now
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3968,That's perfectly okay. It's quite normal not to have everything figured out right away. The idea of giving it a try for a short time is already a thoughtful step. Is there anything else on your mind or anything else you'd like to explore today?
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3969,I wish you could help with some tips to try
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3970,"Sure, I can share some tips that might help as you think about this trial. Would it be okay if we go over some ideas together? You can let me know if they seem useful to you."
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3971,yes
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3972,"Great! Here are a few ideas:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Notice the situations or feelings that prompt you to smoke, like stress or specific activities.

2. **Alternative Activities**: Plan activities for when you'd normally smoke, like a short walk or listening to music, to distract yourself.

3. **Stay Hydrated**: Keep water handy to sip on when you have the urge to smoke. This can help with cravings.

4. **Relaxation Techniques**: Try deep breathing or other relaxation methods to help with stress or sleep without relying on cigarettes.

5. **Support System**: Talk to someone you trust about your plan, so they can encourage you.

How do these tips feel to you, and is there anything here you think you might want to try?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3973,Some are great to go with for now. But I think I have psychic myself for it
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3974,"That sounds positive, and it's great that some of these ideas resonate with you. Having prepared yourself mentally for this trial is a wonderful starting point. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss, or any thoughts or concerns you're experiencing about trying this out?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3975,I want to know if smoking has nothing good for smokers?
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3976,"That's a thoughtful question. Many people feel there are certain benefits, like how you mentioned that smoking helps you feel well, especially with starting and ending your day. People often cite stress relief or feeling more relaxed or alert. At the same time, there are well-documented health risks and potential downsides to consider. It’s really about weighing these perceived benefits against the risks and seeing what feels most important to you. How do you feel about balancing those aspects with your own experience?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3977,I will be grateful to hear you tell me more about the risks apart from giving lung cancer
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3978,"Certainly! Aside from lung cancer, smoking is linked with several health risks. It can lead to:

1. **Heart Disease**: Smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke.

2. **Respiratory Issues**: Problems like chronic bronchitis or emphysema can arise due to damage to airways and lungs.

3. **Reduced Circulation**: It can cause reduced blood flow, leading to issues like blood clots or poor wound healing.

4. **Increased Infections**: Smoking weakens the immune system, making you more susceptible to colds and infections.

5. **Impact on Appearance**: It can cause premature aging, such as wrinkles and stained teeth.

These are just a few of the many risks linked with smoking. It's understandable to weigh these against what you enjoy about smoking. How do these risks resonate with your point of view and your health goals?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3979,Then why does the authorities allow it sales
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3980,"That's an important question. Tobacco is a legal product, and its sale is regulated by the authorities. Many governments have implemented measures to educate people about its risks, restrict advertising, and limit where it can be sold or used. The decision to allow its sale is often influenced by historical, economic, and social factors. Yet, it's ultimately up to individuals to make informed choices about smoking. How do you feel about navigating these influences and making decisions for yourself?"
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,client,3981,Well I understand you but my second question is that I have heard people say if one drinks soda after smoking all particles are washed away
131,66c3ecfbd5f63e042cac4b3e,counsellor,3982,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. We've touched upon numerous topics, and since we're nearing the end of our session, I'd like to summarize what we've discussed. You talked about your smoking routine, with a cigarette in the morning and another at night, and how it provides a sense of well-being during those times. Despite this comfort, you've expressed some interest in seeing what a trial period without smoking might look like, considering practical steps to approach it.

We also discussed potential health risks linked with smoking, beyond lung cancer, such as heart disease and respiratory issues, and how these might weigh against the benefits for you. You mentioned hearing about soda having cleansing effects after smoking, opening an interesting dialogue on concerns about health.

Each of these elements gives us a more comprehensive view of your relationship with smoking, your ambivalence about it, and your curiosity to explore possibilities. If there's anything more you'd like to go over, I'm here to help with that too. Thank you for sharing so openly, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you want to continue this conversation further."
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3983,Hi there! I'm really glad you've taken the step to chat today. How are you feeling as we get started?
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3984,I am feeling good today
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3985,"That's great to hear! As we start our conversation, is there something specific that's on your mind or something you'd like to talk about today regarding smoking or anything else?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3986,Sure about my smoking habit
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3987,Thanks for sharing that. It can be helpful to start by simply exploring what's going on with your smoking habit. Could you tell me a bit about your experience with smoking and how it's currently a part of your life?
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3988,I have being smoking for several years and i was introduced by my friend
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3989,"It's understandable that influences like friends can play a role in starting certain habits. Now that you’ve been smoking for a while, what are some aspects that you like or find challenging about it?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3990,I find it hard quitting
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3991,"Quitting smoking can certainly be challenging for many people. It sounds like you might be feeling a bit stuck because part of you wants to quit, but it's proving difficult. What do you think makes it hard for you to stop, and are there any moments when you feel more motivated to quit?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3992,I have being addicted to it and i find it hard to quit
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3993,"Addiction can definitely make the process of quitting feel more daunting. It shows strength that you're acknowledging it. Despite feeling the grip of addiction, are there certain reasons or situations that make you want to quit or think about cutting back?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3994,Sure i want to quit because it is affecting my body system
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3995,"You're noticing the impact smoking is having on your body, and it sounds like that's a significant motivation for you to reconsider your relationship with smoking. It's understandable to want to protect your health. What specifically have you noticed about the effects on your body that concerns you?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3996,I feel stressed easily now a days
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3997,"It sounds like you've noticed a change in your stress levels, and that's understandably concerning. Smoking can sometimes feel like a way to cope with stress, yet it seems to be affecting your health and well-being. How does feeling more stressed influence your thoughts about continuing to smoke or cutting back?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,3998,I feel easily stressed now than i used to be before
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,3999,Recognizing changes like this can be really important in understanding how smoking fits into your life. It's clear that the increased stress is something that's on your mind. How do you see this increased stress connecting with your desire to maybe reduce or stop smoking?
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4000,I want to quit so it wont affect me any longer
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4001,Your desire to quit to improve your well-being is really strong and important. It's understandable that you're motivated by wanting to prevent any further impact on your health. Is there anything else you’d like to share about your experience with smoking or reasons for wanting to quit before we explore what steps might feel right for you?
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4002,No
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4003,"Thank you for sharing so openly. You’ve discussed some meaningful reasons why you want to quit smoking, like the impact on your body and stress levels. Would it be alright with you if we start discussing some steps you might consider toward quitting or cutting back?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4004,Alright
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4005,"Great. You've identified that quitting smoking is important to you, especially to improve your health and manage stress. Starting small and thinking about what might work best for you is key. Do you have any ideas or preferences on what your first step could be, or would you like to brainstorm some options together?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4006,No
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4007,"That's perfectly okay. Sometimes knowing that you want to change is the first and most important step on its own. We can start small, and if you like, I can share some common strategies, and you can decide if any seem like a good fit. Would that be helpful?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4008,Sure
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4009,One option some people find helpful is setting a specific date to either cut back or quit entirely. Others focus on understanding and changing routines or triggers that prompt smoking. Some people benefit from support groups or talking to someone who has been through a similar process. Does any of these ideas resonate with you or seem like something you'd like to explore further?
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4010,Alright i understand
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4011,"It's great to hear that it's making sense to you. Taking this first step toward understanding what might work for you is a big deal. Is there a particular approach you’d like to try first, or would you like to continue exploring different options to see what feels right?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4012,NO
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4013,"That's completely fine. It’s important to move at your own pace. You’re already doing a lot by reflecting on your reasons and thinking about change. If there's ever a time you want to explore more options or talk about anything else related to quitting or cutting back, just let me know. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4014,No there is nothing else for me to talk about
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,counsellor,4015,"Thank you for the conversation today. Let me summarize what we've talked about. You've shared that you've been smoking for several years, with some initial influence from a friend. Lately, you've noticed that smoking is affecting your body, especially with increased stress levels. This has led to a strong desire to quit smoking altogether. We explored the idea of taking steps like setting a quit date or identifying triggers, and you’re considering what might work best for you. It's important to remember that while it may feel challenging, you’re already taking important steps by thinking about how you want to change. If you ever want to talk more or need support along the way, I'm here for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
132,672ba36306ffff22782b0727,client,4016,No
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4017,Hello there! It's good to have you here today. How have you been lately? Any thoughts or feelings you'd like to share as we start our conversation?
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4018,I was unwell last week but feeling better now.
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4019,I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better now. Being unwell can really take a toll. How have you been managing everything else since then?
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4020,OK.
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4021,"It's good to hear that you're managing things. What's been on your mind lately, especially when it comes to smoking?"
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4022,I know i smoke too much but i enjoy it.
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4023,"You find pleasure in smoking, even though you're aware that you might be smoking more than you'd like. It sounds like there's a bit of a push and pull between enjoyment and knowing it might be too much. How do these feelings interact for you?"
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4024,"I was diagnosed with emphysema in 2014 so i'm maybe thinking because the damage to my lungs is done, why give up?"
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4025,"The diagnosis of emphysema has understandably shaped your thoughts around smoking. On one hand, it sounds like you're thinking about the irreversible impact on your lungs, and on the other, there's consideration about whether it's worth making a change. What does that conflict look like for you?"
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4026,Exactly as you have described it.
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4027,"That must feel challenging, carrying these two perspectives—enjoying smoking and the knowledge of its effects on your health. I'm here to support you as you reflect on these different parts of your experience. What would you like to focus on today when it comes to your thoughts or feelings about smoking?"
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4028,Not much really.
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4029,"That's okay; sometimes just having a space to talk about things can be helpful, even if there's not a specific focus at the moment. Is there anything else you'd like to share or explore, whether it's related to smoking or something else you're thinking about?"
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4030,Not at the moment.
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,counsellor,4031,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let me summarize what we've talked about. You've shared that although you enjoy smoking, there's an awareness of how much you're smoking, especially considering your past diagnosis of emphysema. This creates a conflict between enjoying the habit and questioning the payoff given the damage that's been done. We explored these feelings, and you've given yourself the space to think about these interconnected parts of your experience. If there's anything you'd like to revisit or delve into further in the future, I'm here to support you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
133,5bacf6a4b95cc700014b56a8,client,4032,No
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4033,"Hello there! I'm glad you're here today. How are you doing? Feel free to share anything on your mind, whether it’s about your day, or anything you’re comfortable talking about. I'm here to listen and support you."
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4034,I am here to get advice on stopping smoking
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4035,"I appreciate you sharing that with me, and it's great to hear that you're thinking about making a change. Quitting smoking is a big step, and it's normal to have mixed feelings about it. What are some thoughts or feelings you have about smoking and the idea of quitting?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4036,I don't think I'll be able to quit
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4037,"It sounds like you're feeling unsure about your ability to quit smoking, and that can be really tough. It's common to have doubts when considering such a significant change. What are some specific concerns or challenges that come to mind when you think about quitting?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4038,I've been smoking for so long I don't know what to replace it with
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4039,"It sounds like smoking has been a part of your life for quite some time, and the thought of not having it might feel like losing something familiar and constant. It can be challenging to imagine what life would look like without it. What role does smoking play in your life, and what, if anything, do you think it provides for you?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4040,stress relief
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4041,"Smoking seems to serve as a way to manage stress for you, offering a sense of relief when things get overwhelming. It's understandable why you might be concerned about losing that coping mechanism. What are some other ways you've found relief from stress, even if you haven't relied on them as much as smoking?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4042,going on a walk
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4043,Going for a walk sounds like a wonderful way to relieve stress. It not only provides a break but can also allow some time to clear your mind. How do you feel when you take a walk? What makes it a helpful way for you to manage stress?
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4044,it distracts my mind makes me focus on the things I see while walking
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4045,"Walking offers you a moment to focus on your surroundings and perhaps shift your attention away from stressors. That sense of distraction and presence can be quite refreshing. I'm curious, have there been times when walking has helped you feel better, even if just a little?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4046,yes
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4047,"That’s wonderful to hear. It sounds like walking can have a positive impact when you're feeling stressed. How do you see walking, or perhaps other activities, fitting into your life if you were to take steps toward quitting smoking?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4048,it would be hard to completely replace it since I smoke so much
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4049,"It's understandable to feel that way, especially when smoking is such a frequent part of your routine. Quitting or cutting back can feel daunting when it's something you're used to throughout the day. What do you think it might be like to start incorporating more walks or other stress-relieving activities, even alongside smoking at first, just to see how you feel?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4050,yes
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4051,"It sounds like you're open to the idea of introducing more walks into your routine, even as you continue smoking for now. This could be a gentle way to explore how different activities feel without putting too much pressure on yourself. Is there anything else you'd like to talk through or explore about this process, or any other thoughts you want to share?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4052,no
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,counsellor,4053,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You've shared that while you're interested in quitting smoking, you're feeling unsure about your ability to do so. Smoking plays a significant role in stress relief for you, but you also find stress relief through walking because it distracts your mind and helps you focus on your surroundings. As a potential step, you're considering incorporating more walks into your routine to see how it feels, even while you're still smoking. I'm glad we could talk through these thoughts today. If you have more to discuss or need support in the future, I'm here for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
134,670c216ba5f0d5b2ab641d76,client,4054,No
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4055,"Hello, I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling as we begin our conversation?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4056,im fine thanks
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4057,"It's good to hear that. As we start our conversation, is there anything particular about your smoking habits that's on your mind today?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4058,not at the moment
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4059,That's perfectly fine. We can take our time. Sometimes talking about habits can bring up mixed feelings. Do you ever find yourself feeling conflicted about smoking?
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4060,no but dont want to feel more stressed once i have stopped smoking
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4061,"It sounds like the idea of quitting smoking brings some concerns about stress for you. Balancing stress can be challenging, especially when thinking about making a change. Would you like to talk more about what ways smoking currently helps you manage stress?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4062,please do
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4063,"Thank you for sharing. Smoking might be a way to cope with stress for you. How does it play a role in your day-to-day life, especially during stressful moments?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4064,i smoke more and within less time if im stressed which is all the time
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4065,It seems like smoking has become a frequent response when you're feeling constantly stressed. It must be challenging to navigate stress when it feels ever-present. What do you think contributes to this ongoing stress in your life?
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4066,everything i have going on
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4067,"It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now, and it might feel overwhelming at times. Dealing with multiple stressors can certainly make things feel more intense. What do you think would help alleviate some of this stress, even just a little bit?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4068,a different house to live in having money as im always skint
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4069,"Those are truly significant challenges that can weigh heavily on you. The desire for a more stable living situation and financial security is understandable, and addressing them could play a significant role in reducing stress. How does smoking fit into these aspects of your life, if at all?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4070,i smoke too much
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4071,"It sounds like smoking is something that's become quite frequent for you. Considering the stress and financial strain you're facing, how do you feel about the amount you currently smoke?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4072,i need to stop for both health and money reasons
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4073,"You've identified some important factors—both health and financial reasons—that are motivating you to think about stopping smoking. It shows you're considering the broader effects smoking has on your life. What small steps, if any, have you thought about taking toward reducing or quitting smoking?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4074,nothing so far as i dont think of it sometimes until i smoked a roll up
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4075,"It seems like smoking has become a routine part of your day, sometimes even slipping into your awareness without much thought. If you were to start thinking about it differently, what do you imagine the first small step might look like for you?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4076,might not have so many
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4077,Considering the idea of cutting back a bit on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day is a positive step. It's about finding what feels manageable for you. Is there anything else you want to explore or discuss before we consider how you might begin making changes?
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4078,i dont think so
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4079,"Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. Let's take a moment to reflect on what we discussed: you've shared the significant stressors you're facing, and how smoking has been a way to cope with them, even though you recognize the impact it has on your health and finances. You're considering the possibility of reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. Would you like to talk about a potential plan to help you start exploring that change?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4080,yes why not
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4081,"Great! Let's think about what reducing your smoking might look like in a way that feels comfortable for you. Is there a specific situation or time when you feel most inclined to smoke, where you might try cutting back first?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4082,first thing in the morning and if i have to go out in public i smoke more
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4083,"So, mornings and public situations are times when you're more likely to smoke, which makes sense given how they can be stressful times. Perhaps starting with one of these situations could be a manageable way to begin trying to reduce. Would you feel comfortable experimenting with different ways to handle one of these situations without automatically reaching for a cigarette?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4084,yes
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4085,"That's a positive step forward. Maybe in the morning, you could try waiting a little longer before having your first cigarette or having a glass of water first. In public, maybe carrying something else to hold or focusing on your breathing could help. Would either of these approaches resonate with you? Or is there another idea you'd like to try?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4086,yes willing to try this\
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4087,"That's wonderful to hear. Trying out these small changes can be a great start, and it's all about finding what works best for you. Please remember, it's perfectly okay to take things one step at a time, and I'm here to support you along the way. Would you like to set a time to check back in and talk about how these changes are going for you?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4088,yes why not
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4089,"Great! Let's plan for another session to touch base and see how you're feeling about these changes. Reflect on what's working, what's challenging, and we'll continue from there. You've already taken a big step simply by thinking about change, and I'm here to walk this journey with you. Take care until then, and feel free to reach out if you need support in the meantime."
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4090,ok great thank you
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4091,"Thank you for the conversation today. You've shared that smoking often helps you manage stress, which is something you face a lot in your life right now. You've expressed a desire to quit smoking for health and financial reasons, even though sometimes it happens without much thought. We talked about the idea of reducing the number of cigarettes, particularly in the mornings and in public situations where you tend to smoke more. You agreed to try delaying that first morning cigarette and finding something else to focus on when in public. We'll plan to check back in and see how these changes are going. Thanks again for your openness and commitment; I'm here to support you all the way.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4092,"Yes, let's continue."
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4093,"I'm glad you want to keep the conversation going. As you think about trying out some of these changes, is there anything else you'd like to explore or any support you feel would help you along the way?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4094,not yet but will try this step and see what i do
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4095,"That sounds like a solid plan. Taking things one step at a time gives you the opportunity to see what works best for you. You can always adjust along the way. Feel free to reach out if you decide you need further support or want to discuss anything. You're doing something important for yourself, and I'm here to walk with you on this journey whenever you need. Take care, and we'll reconnect soon."
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4096,ok great thanks bye
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,counsellor,4097,"Thank you for the conversation today. You've shared that smoking often helps you manage stress, which is something you face a lot in your life right now.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
135,5cdc899d48d5f100195fafff,client,4098,No
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4099,Hello! It's great to meet you today. How have you been feeling lately?
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4100,content
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4101,I'm glad to hear that you're feeling content. What has been contributing to this positive feeling for you lately?
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4102,"nothing, I just feel neurtal"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4103,That's understandable. Being in a neutral space is okay too. How do you find yourself spending your time when you're feeling neutral? Is there anything specific you like to do or think about?
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4104,I would like to keep working and making money or play video games while watching television.
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4105,"That sounds like a mixture of staying productive and enjoying some relaxation. Balancing work and leisure can be important. How does smoking fit into your routine with work and gaming, if at all?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4106,it doesn't. It is an addiction that I hate
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4107,"It sounds like smoking is something you're not happy about, and it doesn't align with the things you enjoy. Can you tell me more about what it's been like to have this addiction?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4108,my wife wants me to quit and I want to quit for my health and my marriage. I try to quit but the cravings get really bad and I it seems like I cant control myself from buying another pack.
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4109,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, wanting to quit for both your health and your relationship, yet finding it hard to manage those strong cravings. It must be challenging to feel caught between what you deeply want and the pull of addiction. What keeps you motivated to continue thinking about quitting, despite the difficulties you've faced?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4110,how happy my wife will be is the biggest motivator. I also would like to save that money I'm spending on it.
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4111,"Focusing on your wife's happiness and the financial benefits of quitting are strong motivators. These are meaningful reasons to you, and they can help guide you through this challenging journey. What small steps do you think you might start with to work toward these goals, when you feel ready?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4112,it would be great if I didn't see it so often in movies and television. I need stronger willpower and I can't seem to find it.
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4113,"Seeing smoking in movies and television can definitely make it harder, especially when you're working on strengthening your willpower. It's tough when reminders are all around. What helps you stay strong in other areas of your life, and do you think you could connect that same strength to your desire to quit smoking?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4114,I honestly have no willpower against my vices. I wish I did. I do good for a couple of days even a week and then the craving is so powerful that I can't seem to stop myself.
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4115,"It sounds like those cravings can feel overwhelming, even after periods where you're doing really well. Managing that pull is incredibly tough, especially when it feels so overpowering. Remember, it's about progress and not perfection. Is there something that helps, even a little, during those good days that we might build on together?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4116,"I do really well on those days. I work harder, earn more money, feel better about myself."
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4117,"It seems like those good days bring out the best in you, where you're able to focus more on work and feel better about yourself. That sense of accomplishment and self-worth is significant. Recognizing how positive those times feel could be a strong foundation to build on. Is there anything else you want to discuss, or shall we explore some ways to have more of those good days moving forward?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4118,I need the thoughts in my head that seem to be forcing me to make bad decisions to stop.
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4119,"Those persistent thoughts can be really discouraging, especially when they feel like they're driving your actions toward choices you want to change. It's like having a constant internal battle. Would it be okay if we talked a bit about some strategies that might support you in managing those thoughts, so you can have more control over your decisions?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4120,"sure, you seem to be wanting to rush towards that"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4121,Thank you for pointing that out. I want to make sure we're moving at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Let's stay where you feel is most helpful. Is there anything else that comes to mind or concerns you'd like to address before we consider strategies for managing those thoughts?
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4122,no continue on
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4123,"Alright, thanks for letting me know. Let's reflect on the strengths and successes you've had on those good days. One approach might be focusing on the empowerment you feel during those times, using it as a reminder when cravings start showing up. We can also explore some small, achievable steps you can try when those thoughts come up, gradually building your willpower over time. How does that sound to you?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4124,I think small and achievable is the best
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4125,"Small and achievable steps can create a solid foundation for change. Starting with what feels manageable can make the journey less daunting and help reinforce your confidence over time. Perhaps we could explore some specific actions you might try on those challenging days, like finding a brief distraction or having a supportive chat with someone you trust. Does that feel like a step you might want to consider?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4126,I don't think chatting with someone would be helpful. I would rather do this on my own
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4127,"Understood. Wanting to tackle this on your own is perfectly okay. Finding small distractions or activities that engage you could be empowering. It might help to identify a couple of enjoyable things you can turn to when the urge strikes, things you truly enjoy and that can redirect your focus. What sorts of things come to mind that might fit this role for you?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4128,"video games, audiobooks, televison/movies"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4129,"Those sound like great options that you enjoy. Each of them could provide a welcome distraction and help to shift your focus when cravings hit. It might be useful to have these things readily accessible, so you can turn to them quickly in those moments. How do you feel about trying this approach and seeing how it works for you?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4130,do the cravings eventually just go away? They dont seem to with me
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4131,"Cravings can be persistent, especially at the beginning, but over time many people find that they become less intense and frequent. It's important to know that this is a gradual process, and everyone's experience is different. Even if they don't disappear completely, they can become more manageable as you build new habits and coping skills. Celebrating small victories and being kind to yourself can help keep you motivated. Does knowing this help in any way, or bring up anything else you'd like to discuss?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4132,I guess I could play a game to distract me to try it out for the next week.
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4133,That sounds like a really solid plan. Using a game as a distraction when cravings arise over the next week can give you a chance to see how it feels and what works for you. It's a step toward creating those good days you're aiming for. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about before we wrap up today?
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4134,"you are persistent in making this go your way and pace. It makes me feel like you are just doing what you can as quickly as possible. It really feels pressured. But yes, lets wrap it up."
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,counsellor,4135,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. We started by talking about your motivation to quit smoking, primarily driven by the desire to make your wife happy and to save the money spent on smoking. You shared the challenges you face with strong cravings, particularly after having some successful smoke-free days. We explored the idea of using enjoyable activities like video games, audiobooks, and television as distractions to help manage cravings. Finally, you expressed your intent to try playing a game as a strategy over the next week. I'm here to support you on this journey, and I appreciate your openness in sharing your thoughts and feelings with me.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
136,5bc9f8b677740000016a08b5,client,4136,No
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4137,"Hello there! It's great to see you today. How are things going for you? Feel free to share anything that's on your mind, and we can take it from there."
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4138,Not good
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4139,I'm sorry to hear that things aren't going well. Would you like to talk a bit about what's been happening lately? I'm here to listen and support you.
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4140,My finances are low
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4141,That sounds really tough. Dealing with financial stress can be overwhelming. How's that been affecting you recently?
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4142,I have been anti social a lot I think i am derr
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4143,"It sounds like the stress might be taking a toll on your social life, and perhaps even how you're feeling about yourself. That can be really isolating. What's been going through your mind about all of this?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4144,Thinking that i am a failure
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4145,"It must be incredibly challenging to feel that way. It's difficult when negative thoughts start to take over. Remember, you're not alone—many people struggle with similar feelings. Is there anything specific that triggers this feeling of being a failure for you?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4146,Not being able to provide for my loved ones
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4147,That's an immense amount of pressure to feel like you're unable to provide for those you care about. It's clear you have a lot of love and responsibility toward your loved ones. How do you usually cope with these feelings when they come up?
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4148,I tell myself it's going to get better one day
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4149,"It's hopeful to remind yourself that things can improve. Holding onto that hope can be a source of strength. In the meantime, how do you feel about the role smoking might play in all of this, if at all?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4150,It helps me calm down
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4151,"Smoking seems to be something you lean on when you're feeling overwhelmed or need to calm down. It sounds like it provides a sense of relief during stressful times. At the same time, have there ever been moments where you've felt conflicted about smoking, or has it always felt like a positive thing for you?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4152,There are times I have felt conflicted about smoking
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4153,"It sounds like there are moments when you're uncertain about smoking, even though it helps with stress. What kinds of things do you find yourself feeling conflicted about?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4154,"That I am damaging my health, that it's a short term relief for my worries"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4155,"It seems like you're aware that while smoking offers temporary relief, there's also a concern about the long-term effects on your health. It's a significant insight to recognize that it might be just addressing things in the short term. How do you feel when you think about the impact smoking could have on your health in the future?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4156,Worried
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4157,That worry for the future sounds like it's weighing on you. It's understandable to feel concerned about your health and how smoking might affect it over time. What do you think might help you manage that worry moving forward?
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4158,Not thinking much about it
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4159,"Sometimes trying not to think too much about it can feel like a way to manage the worry. It can be a challenging balance to strike, dealing with anxiety while still being aware of what's important to us. Does it feel like that approach has been helping you, or do you find yourself still grappling with those worries?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4160,I still grapple the worries
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4161,"It sounds like those worries continue to linger, even when you try not to focus on them. It can be hard to navigate those feelings. Is there anything that brings you a sense of peace or reassurance during those times, even briefly?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4162,Hoping things will get better
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4163,"Hope is such a powerful thing to hold onto, especially when you're facing tough times. That sense of optimism about the future can be a guiding light amid uncertainty. Given how much is on your mind, is there anything else you feel is important for us to explore today?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4164,No
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,counsellor,4165,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about so far. You're navigating a lot of pressure and stress, particularly related to finances and feeling like you're not being able to provide for your loved ones, and that's been affecting your social life. You've shared the complexity of how smoking helps you manage stress in moments, but also the health concerns it raises for you. Despite these challenges, you're holding onto hope that things will get better. Your awareness of these issues is a strong starting point for exploring any changes you might want to make in the future. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
137,6091b2b1fec07f6e3f674cd3,client,4166,No
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4167,Hello! It's good to have you here today. How are you feeling as we begin our session?
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4168,"Great, just hard"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4169,"I appreciate you being here, even though things feel tough. What has been making things hard for you recently?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4170,Stress and work related problems
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4171,Work and stress can feel like a heavy burden to carry. It's understandable that those pressures could affect many areas of life. How has smoking played a part in managing that stress for you?
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4172,"Yeah, it's my coping mechanism"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4173,"Smoking feels like it gives you some relief when dealing with stress. At the same time, are there any aspects of smoking that you feel differently about, perhaps any concerns or mixed feelings?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4174,"Yeah, the cost of smoking"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4175,It sounds like the financial impact of smoking is something that weighs on you. Balancing the relief it provides with its cost might feel challenging. How does it feel to think about this mix of benefits and drawbacks?
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4176,This is exactly what's making me want to quit
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4177,"It sounds like you're experiencing a strong desire to quit, driven by the conflict between finding relief in smoking and the burden of its cost. That must create a lot of inner tension. What part of quitting feels most motivating, and what feels most challenging to you?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4178,"Most challenging is definitely dealing with stress without smoking. Most motivating would be a healthier lifestyle and the money saved,"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4179,"A healthier lifestyle and saving money sound like great motivators, yet the challenge of finding new ways to manage stress is understandably daunting. It's clear you have strong reasons for wanting to change. How do you envision managing stress differently if you weren't relying on smoking?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4180,"It's the withdrawals mainly. If I can get through this phase, I could quit completely."
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4181,"Getting through the withdrawal phase seems like a pivotal step for you. It sounds like you have confidence that once you're past that hurdle, quitting can become a reality. What thoughts or strategies have you considered to help you manage or cope with withdrawal symptoms?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4182,"None at the moment, what should I do?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4183,"There are definitely some strategies that could be explored to manage withdrawal symptoms, but I'd like to make sure we cover everything you might want to discuss before moving forward. Is there anything else you want to talk about at this point?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4184,"No, that's all"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,counsellor,4185,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me today. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far. You've been dealing with stress and work-related challenges, and smoking has been your way of coping with it. However, the financial cost of smoking is weighing on you, and the desire for a healthier lifestyle and saving money are motivating you to consider quitting. The most significant hurdle seems to be managing stress and withdrawal symptoms, and while strategies are yet to be explored, you feel confident that overcoming this phase could lead to successfully quitting smoking.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
138,66e0e07f5ef5d13d6635ceb4,client,4186,No
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4187,Hello there! I'm really glad we have this time to sit down and chat today. How are you feeling about our conversation? Is there anything specific you’d like to start with or explore together?
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4188,No
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4189,That's perfectly fine. We can just have a relaxed conversation and see where it takes us. Can you tell me a little about your smoking habits and what role smoking plays in your life right now?
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4190,I snoke about 15 cigarettes a day
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4191,"Thanks for sharing that with me. Smoking 15 cigarettes a day is a strong habit in your life. I'm curious, what are some of the things you enjoy about smoking, and on the other hand, what are some of the things that concern you or you don't like as much?"
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4192,Smoking is something I have done for al long time. I don't like how expensive it has gotten.
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4193,"It sounds like smoking has been a long-standing part of your daily routine, but the rising costs are a drawback for you. What keeps you going with smoking, despite these financial concerns?"
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4194,It is a habit that provied some comfort
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4195,"Smoking seems to offer you a sense of comfort, almost like a reliable ritual in your life. Balancing that comfort with the expense must be challenging. How do you feel about this trade-off between comfort and cost?"
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4196,I am fine with it for now
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4197,"It sounds like you're feeling okay with that balance at the moment. As we continue our conversation, we can explore different aspects of your smoking habit and see if there are any other areas where you might feel conflicted or curious. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your smoking or anything else on your mind today?"
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4198,no
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4199,"That's all right. Thank you for being open about your smoking. If you ever find yourself wanting to talk more about this or anything else, I'm here to listen and support you. Feel free to reach out anytime. Take care!"
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4200,thanks
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,counsellor,4201,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we’ve discussed. You mentioned that you currently smoke about 15 cigarettes a day and that smoking has been a long-standing habit in your life, providing a sense of comfort. At the same time, you're finding the expense a concern. Right now, you're okay with the balance between comfort and cost. It's important to acknowledge these aspects, and I appreciate you sharing your thoughts and feelings about smoking with me. If you ever want to delve deeper into this or explore any changes in the future, I'm here for support.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
139,5e12194094d5ee89089a78d2,client,4202,No
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4203,Hi there! It's great to meet you. How are you doing today?
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4204,"I'm ok, how are you"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4205,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm glad you're here today. What would you like to talk about?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4206,Here to talk about smoking
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4207,That sounds like a good place to start. What’s been your experience with smoking?
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4208,"I've smoked for over 20 years, currently smoke around a pack a day.  Tried to quit before but it never worked out, other than when I was pregnant, and I stopped completely"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4209,"That's quite a long journey with smoking. It sounds like you were able to stop when you were pregnant, showing you’ve experienced a time when you didn't smoke. What was it like for you during that time, and what motivated you to stop then?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4210,"Well obviously the health of my baby, but also I just absolutely lost the taste for them.  I suddenly found them disgusting, before I even knew I was pregnant, which only made sense later"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4211,"It seems like your body's natural reaction and the desire to protect your child's health were strong motivators for you. Now, as you're thinking about it, what are some things that you like and maybe don't like about smoking?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4212,"It's a waste of money, it's not healthy and I already have enough problems, it's gross and nasty and disgusting, and I want to set a better example for my kids"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4213,"You're really clear on the downsides of smoking, especially considering your health and your desire to be a good role model for your kids. It seems like there's a strong part of you that values these aspects of your life and wants to make some changes. How do you feel about the idea of quitting again in the future?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4214,I don't really even like smoking.  I want to quit but I've been unsuccessful with it a bunch in the past so I just kinda stopped trying
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4215,"It sounds frustrating to have tried to quit before without the success you were hoping for. Despite that, there's a part of you that still wants to leave smoking behind. It shows a lot of strength that you’re even here and talking about it again. What do you think might be different this time if you were to try quitting?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4216,"I'm getting older.  I wasn't really concerned for my health when I was younger.  I did this online test about my risk for lung cancer and it was high, so I just think I should try maybe"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4217,"It's understandable that noticing changes as you get older, along with that online test result, could make quitting feel more pressing. It sounds like you're thinking about the future and wanting a healthier path forward. Is there anything else on your mind or any other reasons you're considering change?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4218,"I am a single parent, I don't want my kids to grow up and not have grandparent for their kids.  I don't want my kids to lose me early, and I want to see them grow up and grow old"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4219,You're really motivated by your love for your kids and the desire to be there for important milestones in their lives. These sound like powerful reasons to think about making a change. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore further regarding smoking before we discuss potential next steps?
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4220,"I just don't want to die early, i want to see my kids grow up and grow older"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4221,"Your desire to be there for your kids as they grow up is so important to you. It's clear that being around for them, and staying healthy for yourself, are priorities that are close to your heart. Would it be alright if we explore some ideas about how you might begin to take steps towards quitting smoking?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4222,Sure
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4223,"Great! I'm glad you're open to discussing this. Let’s take a moment to recap some of what you've shared. You've mentioned that you’re motivated by wanting to be healthy for your children, the financial cost, and the feeling that smoking is something you don’t even enjoy anymore. Against the backdrop of previous attempts, you’re considering new motivation due to your increased awareness of health risks.

Let’s explore what might make this attempt different. What could be a first small step that feels manageable to you in moving towards quitting?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4224,Cutting down on how many cigarettes I smoke a day
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4225,"That sounds like a practical and achievable first step. Reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke daily can be a gradual way to ease into quitting without feeling overwhelmed. How would you like to go about cutting down, and what kind of support might be helpful from others or resources during this time?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4226,I don't know.  As long as it's not too drastic I think it should be ok
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4227,"Taking it slow and steady can often be easier to manage. Perhaps starting with a small reduction, where you decrease by one or two cigarettes a day, might be gentle enough to ease into. As you adjust, you can continue to review and set new goals. What do you think about trying that approach, and is there anyone who could support you or cheer you on in this process?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4228,"Yeah that sounds do-able.   And I mean not really, I don't really have anybody like that except my kids.  My parents still both smoke, and don't see any need to quit"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4229,"It sounds like your kids could be an important source of motivation and support for you, even if you’re doing this quietly for their sake. Starting with what feels doable, like reducing a couple of cigarettes at a time, is a compassionate way to honor your intentions for change. Remember, your progress is for you and them, and that alone is powerful. 

Would you like to arrange another time to check-in and see how you're progressing with your goal, or is there anything specific you'd like more support with as you start this journey?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4230,Yeah that would be ok and we will see how it goes I suppose
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4231,"That sounds like a good plan. We'll take it step by step and see how things unfold. I’m here to support you, and we can adjust your approach as needed. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and being open today. Let's arrange a time to check in and talk about how things are going with your progress. How does that sound?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4232,ok sounds good
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4233,"Great! I'll look forward to our next conversation. In the meantime, take care of yourself and know that you're taking meaningful steps towards the future you want for yourself and your kids. If anything comes up that you'd like to discuss before then, feel free to reach out. Have a good day!"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4234,"ok thanks, you too"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,counsellor,4235,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's summarize what we've talked about: You've been smoking for over 20 years, mostly a pack a day, and have tried quitting before. The health of your baby once helped you stop, and though it's been challenging since, you're currently motivated by wanting to see your kids grow up. You've mentioned that smoking feels like a waste, it's unhealthy, and not something you enjoy. We discussed starting small by cutting down your daily intake, as a first step. You're focused on your children's future, and we're planning to reconnect soon to see how you're managing with this shift. It's a meaningful step towards the healthier life you're envisioning.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
140,66cbd449c6029aaeeafcb71f,client,4236,No
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4237,Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling as we start our session?
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4238,I'm feeling well. How about you?
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4239,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking! I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good. I'm here to support you with whatever you'd like to talk about, especially when it comes to your thoughts and feelings about smoking. How are things going for you in that area?"

141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4241,"It sounds like you're noticing the impact that smoking is having on your health and are thinking about making a change. That's an important realization. How has your health been affected by smoking, and what has motivated you to consider quitting?"
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4242,My health is what motivates me to quit. I have COPD and shortness of breath
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4243,It sounds like the difficulties with COPD and shortness of breath are reminding you just how much smoking can impact your well-being. It's understandable to want to make changes in light of those health challenges. How do you feel about the idea of quitting? Are there things you find difficult when you think about stopping smoking?
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4244,It is difficult because I've smoked for so long I feel like I would need a new habbit to help me
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4245,"It's understandable that after smoking for so long, it feels like a significant part of your routine. Thinking about finding a new habit to fill that space shows you're considering a positive change. What kind of activities or habits have you thought about that might help you with this transition?"
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4246,Using a vape would probably help
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4247,You're considering transitioning to vaping as a way to cope with the change and fill the gap smoking might leave.

What would be most helpful for you in finding the balance between making a healthier choice while still feeling satisfied with the change?"
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4250,I think vaping would be most helpful
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4251,"Vaping feels like an option that could both support your health goals and satisfy the urge to smoke. You're taking thoughtful steps in considering what will work for you personally. Is there anything else on your mind about quitting smoking, or steps you're thinking of taking? And would you like to talk a bit about planning how to move forward with vaping as a potential support?"
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4252,Talk about vaping

141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4254,Is finding a vape with a good flavor
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4255,"Finding a vape flavor that you enjoy seems like an important part of making this change more appealing and manageable for you. It's about making the transition something you can feel good about. Have you had the chance to explore any flavors yet, or is there anything specific you're looking forward to trying?"
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4256,I've tried a few flavors and I would like to vape with no nicotine
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,counsellor,4257,"Exploring flavors that you enjoy and considering vaping without nicotine shows that you're thinking carefully about how to make this change work for you. Opting for no nicotine is a significant step toward focusing on your health goals. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss in relation to making this transition, or any concerns you might have as you move forward?"
141,663557f1ddd96308299e1015,client,4258,No

142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4261,"Hello there, welcome! I'm really glad you've taken this step to have a conversation today. How have you been feeling lately?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4262,Ok
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4263,"Thanks for sharing that. ""Okay"" can mean a lot of things, and I'm here to listen to whatever you'd like to talk about. Is there anything in particular on your mind today, or anything you're hoping to get out of our conversation?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4264,am feeling tired
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4265,I hear you—you've been feeling tired. It can be really exhausting dealing with certain stresses or habits in our lives. What's been contributing to that tiredness for you lately?
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4266,lack of sleep
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4267,"Lack of sleep can really take a toll on how we're feeling. Is there anything in particular that you've noticed affecting your sleep, or anything that's been on your mind at night?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4268,no
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4269,"I understand. Sometimes there isn't a clear reason for sleep issues, and that in itself can feel overwhelming. Since you're here today, I'm curious if there's anything about smoking that you might feel contributes to your sleep struggles, or something else that you'd like to explore together?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4270,when i smoke to much i cant sleep
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4271,It sounds like you've noticed a connection between smoking and your sleep difficulties. Smoking too much might be adding to that restless feeling at night. How do you feel about the role smoking plays in your life right now?
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4272,it helps when i smoke to help with stress
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4273,"Smoking seems to offer you some relief when you're feeling stressed, which is pretty common. At the same time, it sounds like it might be affecting your sleep and leaving you feeling tired. How do you balance those benefits and challenges that come with smoking?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4274,i try not to smoke when i go to bed
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4275,It seems like you're already taking some steps to manage the impact smoking has on your sleep by avoiding it before bed. That's a thoughtful approach. How does that strategy work for you? Are there other times or situations where you notice a desire to make changes around smoking?
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4276,it. Helps but then when i wake up i need to smoke
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4277,"It helps you get some sleep, but you find you need to smoke when you wake up. It's like you're caught between trying to ease stress and managing that morning urge. What are your thoughts on this cycle you've noticed?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4278,thats what happens i try to not smoke before my breakfast and smoke late in the afternoon
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4279,"You're making an effort to push back that first smoke until after breakfast and even waiting until later in the afternoon. It seems like you're already experimenting with managing smoking in a way that feels more balanced for you. How do those changes feel for you, and what impact have they had on your day so far?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4280,"they help alot i have cut down on the amount of cigarettes i smoke, i only smoke 2 a day before in was 5, i smoke 1 in the afternoon, the 1 in evening after my dinner"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4281,"That's really a significant shift—from five cigarettes down to two a day. It's evident that some of the changes you're trying are working well for you. How has this reduction affected other aspects of your life, like your energy levels or stress management?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4282,it has helped alot
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4283,That's wonderful to hear that cutting down has had a positive effect on your life. It sounds like your efforts are making a difference and supporting your well-being. Is there anything else about this journey or the changes you're making that you'd like to talk about or explore further?
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4284,thats all
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,counsellor,4285,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's summarize what we've discussed. You've been feeling tired, in part due to a lack of sleep, and have noticed that smoking affects your rest. You find that smoking helps with stress, but it also impacts your sleep when you smoke too much. You've taken thoughtful steps, like avoiding smoking before bed and reducing your cigarette intake from five a day to just two—one in the afternoon and one in the evening after dinner. This change has had a positive impact on your well-being, and you're feeling the benefits in terms of your energy levels and managing stress. It's really impressive to see how your efforts are making a difference. If there's anything else you'd like to explore in the future, I'm here for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
142,5e90a3adb3e1243bdcfaf973,client,4286,No
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4287,Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling about coming in for this session?
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4288,"Hi! I'm feeling good, and I'm interested in what advice you will give me."
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4289,I'm glad to hear you're feeling good about being here. I’m really interested in hearing about your experiences with smoking and what brings you to this session. Would you like to share a bit about that?
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4290,"Hi! I'm feeling good, and I'm interested in what advice you will give me."
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4291,I'm glad to hear you're feeling good about being here. I’m really interested in hearing about your experiences with smoking and what brings you to this session. Would you like to share a bit about that?
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4292,"I've been smoking pretty much every day since I was 17. It's a big financial drain and I am starting to feel its effects on my lungs, so I am starting to consider quitting smoking. I'm nervous though!"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4293,"It sounds like smoking has been a part of your life for quite some time, and you're starting to see both the financial cost and the impact on your health. It's understandable to feel nervous about the idea of quitting, especially when it's been a regular part of your life. What are the reasons that make you want to consider quitting now?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4294,I'm a very poor university student - I can't really afford cigarettes anymore. Plus I want to feel fitter and healthier - I'm too young to be out of breath all the time.
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4295,The financial strain and the desire to feel healthier and more fit are really motivating for you. It sounds like you're recognizing that now might be the right time to make a change. What do you think could be some of the challenges you might face if you decide to quit smoking?
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4296,"When I don't smoke, I become really emotional - I cry very easily and get frustrated. This lasts for days. It's really tough to go through."
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4297,"It sounds like managing your emotions without smoking is really challenging, and enduring those feelings for days can be overwhelming. This is a significant hurdle, especially during such an important time in your life. How have you managed those feelings in the past, or is there anything specific that has helped even a little bit?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4298,I haven't ever been able to cope with the emotions that I get from withdrawal - I always end up smoking again to feel better!
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4299,"Those intense emotions can really make it difficult to stay on track with quitting, especially when smoking seems to offer some relief. It's understandable that you've turned to smoking to manage them in the past. It sounds like finding new ways to handle those feelings could maybe be a part of the journey when you're thinking about quitting. What kind of support do you think might help with this process?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4300,"I'm not really sure. I definitely need to find a way to regulate my emotions without nicotine, so maybe therapy or counselling would help."
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4301,"Therapy or counseling could provide a supportive space for you to explore those emotions and develop strategies to manage them without relying on nicotine. It seems like you're open to finding new ways to help you work through those difficult moments. As you look at the possibility of change, what do you notice about your feelings toward considering getting that support?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4302,I feel pretty anxious and kind of guilty. I'm embarrassed that I can't just quit by myself.
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4303,"Feeling anxious and even guilty about needing support is a common experience, especially when there's a desire to handle things independently. But seeking help is a strong and positive step in taking care of yourself, not something to be embarrassed about. It shows you're committed to making a change. How do you think getting support might change the process of quitting for you?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4304,It would probably make it easier
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4305,"Having support might just create a sense of ease during a challenging time, giving you additional tools and confidence along the way. It seems like you're thinking quite thoughtfully about your options here. As you reflect on all of this, how do you feel about starting to explore these possibilities further?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4306,"I feel like if I actually commit to making a change, it could be possible. I just don't know if I will actually go through with it."
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4307,"The thought of committing to change feels like a possibility, and yet there’s uncertainty about following through. It's perfectly normal to have these mixed feelings when facing such a significant decision. What's one small step you might consider taking that could help make this change feel more achievable for you?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4308,I could speak to my friends and family about seeing a counsellor to get their support and advice - I think that would make me feel braver about doing it.
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4309,"Reaching out to your friends and family for support and advice could help you feel more courageous and assured in taking this step. It sounds like involving them might create a supportive environment for you, which could be really helpful. Is there anything else on your mind today that you’d like to talk about regarding this change?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4310,Not really!
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4311,"Great! Let's go over what you've shared. We've talked about your reasons for wanting to quit smoking, like financial stress and health concerns. You expressed that managing withdrawal emotions is tricky and acknowledged the potential benefits of getting support, like therapy or counseling. You're also considering reaching out to loved ones for additional support.

Does this cover everything we've discussed so far? If you'd like, we can explore some next steps in a way that feels comfortable for you. What do you think?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4312,"Yes, that sounds good to me"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,counsellor,4313,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's sum up what we've discussed. You shared that smoking is becoming a financial strain, and you're beginning to feel the impact on your health. You express a desire to feel fitter and healthier but experience emotional challenges during withdrawal, which makes it difficult to quit alone. You're considering seeking support through therapy or counseling and are thinking about discussing this with friends and family to gather their support. It sounds like you're open to exploring ways to make this possible.

These insights could be valuable as you consider your next steps forward. If you have any questions or want to continue talking about this journey, I'm here to help. Thank you again for your openness today.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
143,5ed62b33b663bd01d5aaa248,client,4314,No
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4315,"Hello! It's great to meet you. How are you doing today? I'm looking forward to having a nice conversation with you. Feel free to share what's on your mind, and know this is a space where we can take things at your own pace."
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4316,i am doing well today just tired from the gym! I am hoping to stop smoking in the future to improve my stamina at the gym
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4317,"It sounds like you're really committed to your fitness and health, especially with the time you spend at the gym. You're considering quitting smoking as a step towards boosting your stamina. How do you feel about the idea of letting go of smoking, especially in the context of your gym goals?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4318,"i feel quite nervous. I feel like i smoke to deal with stressful situations, one being recently my partner broke up with my after 3 years of being together and its made me push to change"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4319,"I'm sorry to hear about your recent breakup; that sounds like a really difficult experience. It's understandable that smoking has been a way for you to cope with stress during such an emotional time. At the same time, it's clear that you're motivated for change by focusing on improving your stamina and health. How do you see yourself managing stress if you were to quit smoking?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4320,i think thats the issue i am not sure how I would! I have been smoking for quite a few years
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4321,"It's understandable to feel uncertain, especially since smoking has been a part of your life for many years as a way to manage stress. Finding new strategies to handle stress can take some time and exploration, but it's a journey worth taking. Are there any times or activities where you've noticed yourself feeling less stressed that might give you some ideas on alternatives to smoking?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4322,hmm i would say playing with my puppy and taking her for walk and also gym!
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4323,It sounds like both spending time with your puppy and going to the gym bring you some peace and relief from stress. These activities seem to offer a sense of companionship and physical release that smoking might have been fulfilling for you. How do you think incorporating more of these activities could support you if you decide to move towards quitting smoking?
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4324,i have already decided to do these but they can only distract me for so long!
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4325,"It's great that you've already thought about using these activities to help manage stress. It shows that you have strong problem-solving skills. At the same time, you’re noticing they might not cover all your needs. What are some other things or strategies you think might help during those times when stress feels overwhelming? Or what about these activities do you think draws you to them when you're feeling stressed?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4326,i have thought about nicotine pactches but I heard people get a big reaction to them and intense nightmares. tried the throat spray version and that cause a burning sensation in my throat.
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4327,"It sounds like you've done some exploration with alternative nicotine options, but reactions like the throat irritation with the spray or concerns about patches have been a bit of a barrier for you. This situation might feel a bit frustrating while you're trying to find what fits best for you. What are your thoughts on exploring other possibilities or talking more about how you might navigate these challenges?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4328,i have tried vaping but i think the 20mg vapes are so much addictive currently am trying 10mg ones and I feel they have helped
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4329,It's great to hear that you're experimenting with different approaches to find a solution that works for you. Transitioning to a lower nicotine strength with the 10mg vapes seems to be a step in the direction you're comfortable with. This adjustment shows your willingness to reduce nicotine use. How does this current approach impact your feelings about smoking and your progress towards your fitness goals?
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4330,i feel like my lungs have been better I believe. i feel not out of breath as much
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4331,"That's really encouraging to hear that you're experiencing some positive changes in your breathing and overall lung function. Feeling less out of breath seems to be a tangible benefit from the adjustments you've made, which could further support your fitness focus at the gym. How do these improvements influence your thoughts about continuing on this path toward reducing smoking?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4332,it makes me feel good. the end goal is to try these new vapes with no nicotine and to then move to completely stopping any form of vaping/smoking
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4333,"Your end goal of moving to nicotine-free vapes and eventually stopping completely is a powerful vision for your future. It reflects a strong determination and commitment to your health and fitness. Knowing that you have this goal in mind, is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about that might support this journey?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4334,i guess to create a plan to when I should lower my nictoine etc would be good!
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4335,"Absolutely! Let's work together on creating a plan that suits your timeline and comfort level. Before we dive into planning, let's recap what we've talked about so far: You've been adjusting to lower nicotine levels with vaping, and you've noticed positive changes in your breathing, especially at the gym. You're also clear on your end goal of moving towards nicotine-free vapes and then stopping entirely. 

Are you ready to start planning how to gradually reduce your nicotine intake further?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4336,yes !
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4337,"Great! As we think about a plan for reducing your nicotine intake, it's helpful to break this down into manageable steps that feel achievable for you. Do you have a specific timeframe in mind for when you’d like to begin reducing the nicotine level further, possibly moving down to those nicotine-free options?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,client,4338,"not really, what do you have in mind?"
144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4339,"We can approach this gradually, giving yourself the time needed to adjust at each step. One option could be to try staying at your current level for a few weeks or a month, depending on how you're feeling, and see how your body and mind respond. From there, you could plan to switch to a lower nicotine level vape for another similar period. This would give you the chance to assess each transition and provide the flexibility to adjust as needed.

144,5ccf4c5db46c7000170d7f5a,counsellor,4341,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. As our conversation is coming to a close, I’d like to summarize what we’ve discussed to reflect on where things stand.

We talked about your motivation to improve your stamina at the gym, and how that goal is inspiring your desire to quit smoking. You've been through a challenging personal time with your recent breakup, which has prompted further reflection on change. You shared how your puppy and gym activities help reduce stress, evolving into positive alternatives to smoking. We also explored your experience with different options like vaping, the adjustments you are making with lower nicotine levels, and how they’ve contributed to improvements in your breathing.

As we discussed your journey towards stopping nicotine use altogether, we agreed on trying a plan over the next couple of weeks, which could include gradually using lower nicotine levels as you feel ready. This includes considering a two-week period as a potential timeframe to evaluate each step.

You've made thoughtful progress so far, and your plan shows a determined focus on your health and fitness. If there's anything more you'd like to explore or adjust in our next session, feel free to do so. Until then, take care, and thanks again for our conversation today."

145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4345,I actually like it
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4346,"Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like smoking is something you enjoy. I'm curious, what are some of the things you like about it?"
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4347,It gives me a relaxed feeling and I enjoy the taste.
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4348,"It sounds like smoking offers you a sense of relaxation and enjoyment with the flavors. Those are certainly appealing aspects.

145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4350,It seems like there might be a part of you that's considering some of the challenges that come with smoking. Would you be open to sharing a bit more about what those drawbacks or concerns are for you?
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4351,"I know its not good for me and sometimes \i want to stop, but in this moment I can't"
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4352,"It sounds like you're aware of the health concerns and have moments where the idea of quitting crosses your mind, but right now, it feels like stopping isn't possible for you. It's really common to feel pulled in different directions like that. What do you think makes it hard to consider stopping right now?"
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4353,"My financial mental health, I am focused on recovering from lost income and if I stop smoking which is the only habit I actually have, I will lose my focus on my bigger problem."
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4354,"Balancing financial recovery with the comfort that smoking provides seems really challenging right now. It helps you focus on the bigger picture by serving as a familiar and soothing habit. These pressures can be overwhelming, and it's understandable to want to hold onto something that brings you relief. As you navigate through these concerns, what would you most like to gain from our conversation today?"
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4355,You tell me

While I won't tell you what to do, I'm here to listen and help you sort through any conflicting feelings or concerns. If there's a particular area you'd like to explore further, we can focus more on that. What do you think about continuing to talk about how smoking fits into your current pressures, like your financial and mental health, and see where that leads us?"
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4357,Sure but you summed it up very well. I'm not mentally fit to quit an old friend when I have an enemy at the door
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4358,"You describe smoking as an old friend, providing comfort amidst the struggles you're facing with your financial situation, like an enemy at the door. Navigating such intense feelings can be tough, and it's natural to lean on something familiar during hard times. As we continue our conversation, is there any aspect of your current situation you'd like to explore to see if there are ways that might help in coping with the pressure you're under?"
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4359,I really don't have much to add to my habbit. I know that when I finally get through my dilemma I will quit as I can focus on alternatives to to help me forget
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4360,"It's reassuring to hear that you have a sense of when you might feel ready to consider alternatives and make a change. The difficult times you're experiencing are weighing heavily on you, and you have a plan for the future when things settle down. Whenever you're ready to explore what those alternatives might look like, we can certainly discuss that together. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today, or something specific you want to keep in mind for the future?"
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,client,4361,No
145,6112bab70c61f8247ee7e228,counsellor,4362,"Thank you for our conversation today.

You feel that smoking acts like an old friend providing comfort while you're dealing with those pressures.

You've been thoughtful about how smoking fits into your life and recognize its both comforting and challenging aspects. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts and concerns with me today. If you need any assistance in the future, I'm here to support you.

146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4368,That's an important decision. It sounds like you're considering making some changes in your life. What are some of the reasons that make you want to quit smoking?

146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4372,"So there's something about the act of smoking itself, particularly having something to do with your hands and mouth, that feels satisfying or comforting. Finding alternative ways to cope with that might be part of what needs to change. What are your thoughts on that?"
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,client,4373,it sounds like a good idea

146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4376,Focusing on new habits can be a helpful approach. It opens up possibilities for different activities that can replace smoking. Is there anything you've tried before or ideas you already have in mind for new habits?
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,client,4377,using gym or toothpicks
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4378,"Those are both interesting options. The gym can be a great way to channel energy and improve health, while using toothpicks might help with the oral aspect. How do you feel about incorporating these activities into your life as part of your plan to quit smoking?"
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,client,4379,sounds good
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4380,It seems like you're building a positive vision for how you might replace smoking with these activities. Is there anything else you want to talk about or explore before we start thinking more concretely about planning your steps forward?

146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4384,"Great! Taking these steps is a positive move toward your goals. Let's think about how you might want to start. Would you prefer to focus first on introducing new habits like going to the gym, using toothpicks, or something else, or would you rather talk about reducing smoking gradually?"
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,client,4385,new habits
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4386,Focusing on building new habits sounds like a great path forward.

146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,client,4391,mon-wed gym and everyday toothpick
146,668912769c60f1491ca58981,counsellor,4392,"That sounds like a solid plan: gym sessions on Monday through Wednesday and using toothpicks daily.

Those feelings can often go hand in hand when we're contemplating change. Is there anything else on your mind about smoking or any other reasons you want to stop?

That sense of wanting to live in a way that feels cleaner and healthier seems important to you. Given everything we've talked about, is there anything else you'd like to share or discuss?"
149,62d6ad4f05c13b6b7f6612e8,client,4481,its been nice to talk to someone about my thoughts

With all this in mind, would you like to start talking about what the next steps might look like for you, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss first?"

149,62d6ad4f05c13b6b7f6612e8,counsellor,4486,"That's a bold and decisive step! Removing cigarettes from your space can help make the change feel more real and reduce temptation. How would you feel about taking that step, and what can I do to support you in this process?"
149,62d6ad4f05c13b6b7f6612e8,client,4487,i will do this and just some coping mechanisms when i get the temptation
149,62d6ad4f05c13b6b7f6612e8,counsellor,4488,"Having strategies in place for when you feel the urge to smoke is really important. There are various techniques, like deep breathing, engaging in a hobby, or going for a walk. What do you think might work best for you when you face temptation?"

149,62d6ad4f05c13b6b7f6612e8,counsellor,4494,"Both gaming and going to the gym are fantastic options.

You've expressed a desire to stop smoking, largely motivated by wanting to improve your health and spend quality time with your daughter. The idea of running a marathon for charity excites and motivates you, though it's also natural to feel a bit scared. We've explored the idea of throwing away any remaining cigarettes and incorporating activities like gaming and going to the gym to help manage cravings. You've made excellent strides toward change, and I'm here to support you in any way you need.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4500,Hello there! I'm so glad you could make it today. How are you feeling as we start our conversation?
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4501,I’m feeling okay what about you
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4502,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm really pleased to have this time to chat with you today. You mentioned you’re feeling okay; how’s everything been going recently on your end?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4503,Going good
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4504,"I'm glad to hear that things have been going good for you. As we spend a little time together today, is there anything specific you wanted to talk about or focus on, perhaps about smoking or any other area in your life?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4505,Quitting smoking
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4506,Quitting smoking is a significant topic. I'm glad you're open to talking about it. Can you share what makes you think about quitting and what your experiences have been like with smoking?
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4507,"I’ve been smoking around six cigarettes a day, and I’ve been trying to quit because I know it’s not good for me, but it’s been hard to cut down."
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4508,"It sounds like you're aware of the health implications, and you have a desire to quit, but cutting down has been challenging. What has motivated you to consider quitting, and what do you find most difficult about the process?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4509,"I’ve been motivated to quit because of the health risks and the cost of smoking. The most difficult part is breaking the habit, especially during stressful moments when I feel like I need a cigarette"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4510,"You're recognizing both the health risks and the financial cost as important reasons to quit. At the same time, it seems like smoking has become a way to cope with stress, making it a challenging habit to break. What have you noticed about how smoking helps you during those stressful moments?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4511,"Smoking helps me feel calmer during stressful moments, like it’s a quick way to relax. But I know it’s only temporary, and the stress usually comes back. That’s what makes it hard to quit—it feels lik"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4512,"Like smoking offers quick relief in the moment, even though you realize it's only a temporary solution and the stress returns. It's understandable that breaking away from something that seems to help in the short term can be difficult. Have there been times when you've tried to find other ways to manage stress, or is that something you're considering exploring further?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4513,"I haven’t found anything that works as well as smoking for managing stress, but I’ve thought about trying other things, like deep breathing or going for a walk. It’s just hard to replace the habit"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4514,"You're open to trying different methods to manage stress, like deep breathing or taking a walk. It seems like you're exploring options that could work for you, even if replacing that habit feels difficult. What might be a first step that feels achievable for you to try out one of these alternatives?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4515,"A first step that feels achievable might be trying a short walk when I’m stressed, even if it’s just for a few minutes. It’s something simple that I can do without much effort, and it could help me br"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4516,"Considering a short walk is something small yet manageable that might help break the habit. It's encouraging that you're thinking about ways to gradually shift towards new approaches. Would you like to talk more about how taking those small steps could fit into your routine, or is there anything else on your mind regarding your journey with smoking?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4517,"Taking small steps like a short walk could fit into my routine by doing it when I feel stressed, maybe after a meal or in the evening. I think starting with something easy could help me feel like I’m"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4518,"That sounds like a practical and thoughtful way to integrate walking into your routine, especially during key times like after meals or in the evening. It feels like you're gearing up to make these changes gradually, and that's really positive. Would you be interested in exploring more about planning out these small steps, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4519,Yes
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4520,"Great to hear that you're open to exploring more about these small steps. Before we dive into planning, let's take a moment to reflect on what we've talked about today. You've shared a lot about your motivation to quit smoking, knowing the health and financial benefits, and identified stress as a trigger for smoking.

Now that you've mentioned a simple first step like walking, would it be alright if we start discussing how you might incorporate these small steps into your routine more intentionally?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4521,Yes
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4522,"Wonderful. You've already identified that taking a short walk during stressful moments could be a manageable step, especially after meals or in the evening. Perhaps we could think about when your usual smoking times are and how these walks can fit in. What are your thoughts on scheduling these walks or having reminders to help integrate them gradually into your day?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4523,"I think scheduling the walks could help a lot, especially if I can link them to the times when I usually smoke, like after meals or when I feel stressed in the evening. Maybe I could set a reminder on"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4524,"Setting a reminder sounds like a practical approach to help you transition these walks into your routine, especially during those moments when you'd usually reach for a cigarette. Associating this new activity with existing habits could gradually make it a part of your routine. How do you feel about trying this out for a week and then reviewing how it's going?"
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,client,4525,Yes okay
150,66d74dbe2e622fcb810c8192,counsellor,4526,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. We've covered a lot in our conversation, and I truly appreciate your openness and willingness to explore these important themes.

To summarize, you've shared your motivation to quit smoking, primarily due to health concerns and the financial cost. You’ve recognized that smoking temporarily helps relieve stress, making it a challenging habit to break. You’re beginning to look into alternatives for managing stress, like taking short walks, which could fit into your routine, especially after meals or in the evenings.

You've come up with a manageable first step by scheduling these walks and setting reminders, aligning them with your usual smoking times. This gradual shift seems like a strong start toward your goals.

I'm glad we could explore these steps together, and I look forward to hearing how things go for you. Please feel free to reach out anytime if more support or conversation would be helpful. Take care, and thanks again for our discussion today!"

151,670c2841cfd21749eb6feea8,counsellor,4545,"It's okay to feel uncertain about how to handle those emotions. It's a big step just to recognize them. When you think about the possibility of reducing or stopping smoking, what thoughts or feelings come to mind?"

151,670c2841cfd21749eb6feea8,counsellor,4547,That's a really positive perspective. Thinking about the good it will do for you is a wonderful motivator. What benefits do you envision for yourself if you were to stop smoking?

152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4567,"That sounds like you're taking life in stride, which can be a good way to be. As we're chatting today, is there anything specific you'd like to explore together, maybe around your smoking or anything else that's important to you?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4568,Yes tell me what you think about smokers
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4569,"I think smoking is a complex and personal experience, and everyone has their own story and reasons for why they smoke. My role here is to listen, understand your perspective, and support you in exploring any thoughts or feelings you have about smoking. What's your experience been like with it?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4570,Its been a fun ride. It keeps me on my toes
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4571,"It sounds like smoking has added some excitement or energy to your life. At the same time, I wonder if there are moments when you have mixed feelings about it. Are there any challenges or concerns that come up for you regarding smoking?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4572,Sometimes when I read about the health complications I am tempted to stop
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4573,Reading about those health concerns can definitely spark some worry. It seems like there's a part of you that's considering the impact smoking might have on your health. What do you think about those concerns when they come to mind?
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4574,They bother me
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4575,It's understandable that those concerns would bother you. It seems like you're feeling a tension between enjoying smoking and worrying about the potential health risks. This can be a challenging place to be in. What do you think might help you address these concerns?
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4576,Knowing if these health complications are made up will help me a lot
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4577,"It's completely natural to want clear and accurate information, especially when it comes to health. Sorting through all the information out there can be overwhelming. How would having trusted information about smoking and health affect your thoughts about it?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4578,It would influence my decision to quit or continue
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4579,"Having trustworthy information could really guide your decisions moving forward. You're looking for clarity to make the best choice for yourself, and that shows a strong desire to take control of your situation. Is there anything more you'd like to explore about this topic right now?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4580,Do you think I should quit
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4581,I appreciate your openness in asking for my thoughts. What's most important is what you think and feel about quitting. My role is to support you in making a decision that feels right for you. What are your own thoughts and feelings on the idea of quitting?
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4582,To be honest I am against it but my wife complains about it
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4583,"It's understandable to have reservations about quitting, especially if it's something you enjoy or are used to. At the same time, it seems like your wife's concerns are important to you. Balancing your desires with her feelings can be challenging. How has her perspective influenced your own thoughts about smoking?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4584,She is the most important person in my life so it bothers me\
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4585,Her importance in your life and the way her concerns resonate with you really stand out. It seems like there's a strong part of you that values her well-being and your relationship. How do you think you could address both your needs and her concerns in this situation?
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4586,Maybe by reducing the frequency in which I smoke
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4587,"Thinking about reducing the frequency of smoking is a big step, especially considering how important this balance is to you. It sounds like a way to honor both your enjoyment and her concerns. How do you feel about the idea of cutting back a bit at this point?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4588,Its difficult but if it makes her happy I am wiling to
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4589,"Your willingness to make an effort for her happiness shows a lot of dedication and care. It's natural for change to feel challenging, especially when it's something familiar. Is there anything else you want to discuss before we start thinking about how you might approach this change?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4590,No
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4591,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've talked about. You've expressed that smoking has been both enjoyable and exciting for you, but you're also bothered by health concerns. Your wife's happiness is significant to you, and her concerns have motivated you to consider reducing your smoking frequency. Your willingness to explore this change to support your relationship is commendable, even though it may be challenging. Please know that I'm here to support you as you take these thoughtful steps forward.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4592,"Yes, let's continue."
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4593,"Great! As we think about how you might start reducing the frequency of your smoking, it might be helpful to consider small, manageable steps you could take toward that change. What are some ideas or strategies that come to mind that might help make this transition a bit easier for you?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4594,I will need your help with that
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4595,"Of course, I'm here to help you brainstorm some strategies. One approach could be setting small, achievable goals like reducing the number of cigarettes per day or setting specific times when you choose not to smoke. Another option might be finding alternative activities that give you a similar sense of enjoyment or alertness. How do you feel about these ideas, or is there another approach that you think might work well for you?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4596,I like the first option very much
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4597,"Focusing on reducing the number of cigarettes each day sounds like a great way to start. It's a concrete and manageable step you can take. Would you like to think about setting a specific goal for how many cigarettes you might reduce by, or the times you might choose to limit smoking?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4598,I would start by reducing my daily 6 cigars to 3
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4599,"That sounds like a thoughtful and realistic goal. Reducing from 6 to 3 cigarettes per day can be a significant step, and it's great to hear that you're ready to give it a try. What support or plans do you think might help you stay on track as you work towards this change?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4600,I will have to distract myself
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4601,Finding distractions can be a helpful way to support yourself during this change. Engaging in activities that you enjoy or that keep your mind occupied can sometimes ease the transition. Are there specific activities or distractions that you think might work best for you?
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4602,Maybe playing my console
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4603,Playing your console sounds like a fun way to distract yourself and keep your hands busy. It's great that you have something you enjoy and can turn to when those urges to smoke come up. How do you feel about using your console as a tool while making this change?
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4604,Very confident. Thanks a lot
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4605,"That's wonderful to hear. I'm really glad that you're feeling confident about using your console as a constructive way to support this change. Remember, taking small steps and celebrating your progress along the way is important. If you'd like, we can continue to discuss your experiences and any challenges or successes you encounter as you work on reducing your smoking. Do let me know how I can continue to support you."
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4606,I am okay with this
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4607,"Great! I'm glad to hear you're feeling okay with the plan and confident moving forward. You know where to find me if you need any more support or would like to talk through anything further. Thank you for sharing with me today, and I'm here whenever you're ready to continue our conversation. Take care!"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4608,you too
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4609,Thank you! Take care and have a great day!
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4610,I will
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,counsellor,4611,"Thank you for our conversation today. Here's a brief summary of what we've discussed: You've shared that smoking has been an enjoyable part of your life, but you've also expressed concerns about potential health risks. Your wife's feelings are important to you, and her concerns have inspired you to consider making some changes. You've decided to start by reducing the number of daily cigarettes from 6 to 3, and you're planning to use playing your console as a distraction to help achieve this goal. I'm here to support you as you work on this plan, and I appreciate your willingness to explore these steps. Feel free to reach out anytime you'd like to discuss your progress or any new thoughts. Take care, and thanks again for sharing with me today!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
152,66a7ab3a0428bc7ecb480428,client,4612,No
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4613,"Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How are you doing? I'm here to listen and support you, wherever you're at in your journey. What brings you in today?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4614,i am here to listen toyou
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4615,"I'm glad you're here, and it's great that you're willing to listen. This time is really for you, so please feel free to share anything that's on your mind. Have there been any specific things you've been thinking about lately that you'd like to explore together?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4616,I thought you wanted to talk about smoking
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4617,"Absolutely, we can certainly talk about smoking if that's something on your mind. Many people have mixed feelings about their smoking habits. What's your relationship with smoking like these days?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4618,I smoke a lot
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4619,"Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like smoking is a significant part of your daily routine. What are some of the things you like about smoking, and are there any things that concern you or that you don't like as much?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4620,it relaxes me
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4621,"Smoking seems to offer you a sense of relaxation. Many people find it helps them unwind. At the same time, is there anything about smoking that you find yourself worried or curious about?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4622,not really
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4623,"That's completely okay. If at some point you find yourself having any thoughts, concerns, or questions about it, we can definitely explore those together. For now, is there anything else about smoking or any other topics you'd like to discuss?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4624,What are the effects
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4625,"You're interested in knowing more about the effects of smoking. I'm here to provide information that might help. Smoking is known to have a variety of effects on the body, some immediate and others more long-term. In the short term, people often feel relaxed or find it helps them focus. Over time, there are risks that it may impact lungs and heart health, among other things. Would it be helpful to explore more on this topic together?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4626,yes
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4627,"Great. Understanding more about the effects can sometimes clarify our feelings and thoughts about smoking. In terms of long-term health, smoking can increase the risk of conditions like heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory problems. On the flip side, many people experience immediate sensations of relaxation or stress relief. How do you see these effects fitting into your life?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4628,Its true. it relaxes me a lot
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4629,"It really does provide you with that relaxation, which is valuable in your day-to-day life. Balancing that relaxation with potential long-term effects can sometimes lead to mixed feelings. Is there anything specific you're hoping to learn or achieve when thinking about how smoking fits into your life?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4630,you tell me
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4631,"I understand that you're looking for guidance. While I want to respect your readiness and space to explore, I'm here to support you in whatever you decide. If you're open to thinking about change or understanding your smoking habit better, we can look at how it aligns with your overall well-being and goals. But ultimately, it's about what feels right for you in this moment. Is there anything else you'd like to consider or discuss?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4632,I want to change
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4633,"That's a significant decision, and it's wonderful that you're considering it. Wanting to change is an important first step. What are some of the reasons that are motivating you to think about making this change?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4634,I want to be healthier
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4635,"That's an admirable reason and taking steps towards better health is a powerful motivator. It's clear that your health is important to you. Is there anything else supporting your desire to move in this direction, or any specific health goals you're aiming for?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4636,I am too lean so I want to gain weight
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4637,"Gaining weight and improving your overall health are meaningful goals. It sounds like you're looking for ways to support your body in a healthier way, which could also be a part of your motivation to change your smoking habits. How do you envision the connection between quitting smoking and reaching your goal of gaining weight?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4638,I read somewhere that smoking makes you lean
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4639,"That's an interesting observation and something many people have heard. Smoking can sometimes suppress appetite, which might affect weight. Thinking about your goals of gaining weight and improving health, changing your smoking habits could potentially support these objectives. How do you feel about exploring ways to align your smoking habits with your health goals?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4640,I am down to explore
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4641,"That's a great attitude, and I'm here to support you in this exploration. Before we start talking about planning any changes, is there anything else you want to share or discuss?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4642,No lets start
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4643,"Alright, let's take a look at what we've discussed so far. You've expressed a desire to make a change, with a focus on improving your health and reaching your goal of gaining weight. These personal goals are important and motivating for you. If you're ready, we can begin to explore possible next steps. Would you like to discuss some options or take some small actions to start moving towards these health goals?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4644,Lets do both
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4645,"That sounds like a solid approach. We can explore some options and also consider small actions that feel manageable for you. Let's start by thinking about what steps might be feasible. For example, some people find it helpful to set a date to start reducing the number of cigarettes they smoke each day, while others might find support through friends or activities that divert their focus. What do you think might work for you, or what ideas do you have?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4646,I was thinking you could help me
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4647,"Of course, I'm here to help guide and support you. Let's begin by brainstorming a few ideas together.

1. **Setting a Reduction Goal**: You could start by deciding on a specific number of cigarettes you'd like to reduce over the next week.

2. **Identify Triggers**: Try to note when and why you reach for a cigarette, and consider alternative activities that might provide relaxation or focus.

3. **Support System**: Connect with friends or family who can encourage you, or consider joining support groups.

4. **Healthy Alternatives**: Explore snacks or activities that can replace the habit, especially ones that might help in gaining weight.

What resonates with you from these ideas, or are there other thoughts you might have about taking these first steps?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4648,I love all the ideas
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4649,I'm glad to hear that these ideas resonate with you. We can take them one step at a time to make the transition as smooth as possible. Which one would you like to focus on first to help you start working towards your health goals?
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4650,the reduction part
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4651,"Great choice! Setting a reduction goal can be a manageable way to start. We can think about what feels realistic for you. 

For example, how many cigarettes do you currently smoke in a day, and what might be a comfortable number to reduce by in the coming week?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4652,I smoke 8 to 9 cigars a day so i would like to reduce it to 5 for now
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4653,"That's a thoughtful and achievable goal, aiming to reduce to 5. It sounds like a manageable step, making it easier to adjust gradually. How do you feel about keeping a note of your progress each day? It can often provide motivation and help you see the progress you're making."
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4654,Yes i would take note. Thanks a lot
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4655,"You're welcome! Taking note of your progress is a great way to stay encouraged, and I'm really glad you're taking this positive step toward your goals. As you move forward, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need more support. Remember, it's about making progress at your own pace. You've got this!"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4656,Thanks a lot
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,counsellor,4657,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You've shared that smoking currently acts as a source of relaxation in your life, but you're also motivated by the desire to become healthier and gain weight. This has led you to explore making changes in your smoking habits. We discussed various approaches to support this change, and you decided to focus on reducing your daily cigarettes from around 8-9 to 5 as a first step. You're also open to keeping track of your daily progress. It's encouraging to see you taking positive action toward your goals, and I'm here to support you along the way.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
153,672a89bc5e3d67a9fdbdf803,client,4658,No
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4659,Hi there! How are you doing today? I'm glad you could make it to our session. Is there anything on your mind you'd like to start with? We can take things one step at a time.
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4660,I have been smoking for 37 years and I am ready to stop
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4661,"Thank you for sharing that with me. It must be a big decision for you, considering how long you've been smoking. What's motivating you right now to stop smoking?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4662,"my health, and my new religious affiliation"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4663,"Those are very meaningful reasons. Taking care of your health is so important, and aligning your actions with your religious beliefs can bring a lot of peace and purpose. How are these factors influencing your thoughts and feelings about smoking right now?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4664,I also just don't like smoking anymore. I live in a high stress environment and that's not helping either.
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4665,"It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions. On one hand, the stress in your environment might make it challenging to quit, while on the other hand, there's a sense of dissatisfaction with smoking and a desire for change driven by both health and personal beliefs. How do you see these elements fitting together in your decision to stop smoking?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4666,"I know I should stop, I want to stop, sometimes I just need that 5 minutes of peace I get from removing myself from the stress and having a cigarette."
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4667,"That five minutes of peace is really valuable to you, especially in a high-stress environment. It's understandable to seek a moment of calm in a way that's been familiar for so long. How do you feel about the possibility of finding other ways to create those peaceful moments without smoking?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4668,"the stressful environment isn't helping, I have an emotionally abusive roommate"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4669,"That sounds incredibly difficult to navigate, and it's understandable that this environment would add to the stress you're feeling. Living with someone who is emotionally abusive can create a constant tension, and finding ways to manage that stress is very important. How has this situation with your roommate impacted your smoking habits?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4670,I go outside to smoke just to get away from the yelling and gaslighting for 5 minutes
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4671,"Taking that break outside seems to offer you a brief respite from a very tough situation. It gives you a moment to step away, even if it's not under ideal circumstances. Given the challenges you're facing with your roommate, what kind of support do you think might help you as you consider changing your smoking habits?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4672,i don't know
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4673,"Not knowing exactly what kind of support would help is perfectly okay. It can be hard to navigate everything at once, especially in the midst of a stressful living environment. What we can do together is explore some small steps you might feel comfortable trying, either to handle the stress or to start moving toward reducing smoking. What do you think? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss that could help us find a way forward?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4674,I think reducing is a good start right now
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4675,"That sounds like a great, manageable approach given everything you're dealing with. Reducing smoking is a positive step towards your goals and still honors your need for some respite. As you consider cutting back, what kind of small, realistic changes do you feel might fit into your current situation?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4676,"I could ask for more hours at work, but then I would be leaving my daughter who is an autistic adult with the roommate alone"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4677,"Balancing work, personal responsibilities, and the care of your daughter sounds like a complex and delicate situation. The idea of getting more hours at work seems to address a couple of areas, potentially providing fewer moments of direct stress from your roommate, but it's understandable to worry about leaving your daughter in that environment. It's clear you have her well-being in mind. How would you feel about exploring other ways to create positive changes or additional support in your day-to-day life that might also help with reducing smoking?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4678,that sounds good
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4679,"Great. It sounds like you're open to exploring different options, which can be really empowering. Maybe we can think about some small changes or routines that give you those peaceful moments but in new ways. This could be anything from simple breathing exercises to brief walks, or perhaps finding small pockets of support in other areas of your life. Is there any particular idea that resonates with you, or perhaps something else you’ve considered trying?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4680,brief walks sounds like a gooed idea I can bring my daughter with me on those.
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4681,"That sounds like a wonderful idea! Not only can it provide you with some peace, but it also allows you to share that time with your daughter, which could be a positive experience for both of you. Walks can offer a change of scenery and a chance to breathe, both literally and figuratively. What do you think your next steps will be in incorporating these walks into your routine?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4682,I will write them into our schedule
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4683,"That sounds like a solid plan. Writing them into your schedule can help make it feel more intentional and give it a sense of priority. It seems like you're taking meaningful steps toward both reducing stress and smoking in a way that fits your life. Do you feel ready to start with this plan, or is there anything else you'd like to talk through before you begin?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4684,no i think that will be a good place to start
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,counsellor,4685,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. To summarize our conversation: you mentioned that your motivation to stop smoking is driven by concerns for your health and a new religious affiliation. You've also expressed dissatisfaction with smoking due to the high-stress environment created by living with an emotionally abusive roommate, which has made those smoking breaks feel like a rare moment of peace. You're open to exploring small changes, and the idea of taking brief walks with your daughter felt like a promising way to find some peaceful moments. You've decided to incorporate these walks into your schedule as a way to start reducing smoking and managing stress. Remember, this is a step-by-step journey, and I'm here to support you as you take these new steps forward. If you need anything else or want to talk more, feel free to reach out.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
154,650497398724fb2ddc7f6640,client,4686,No
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4687,Hello there! How are you doing today?
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4688,"hello, im good thank you, and yourself?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4689,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking! It's nice to have you here. So, what would you like to chat about today?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4690,about quitting smoking
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4691,That's a really important topic. What has prompted you to think about quitting smoking recently?
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4692,money and  health both equally
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4693,Money and health are both significant reasons. It sounds like you're thinking about the impact smoking has on your finances as well as your well-being. Could you tell me a bit more about what you've been noticing in these areas?
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4694,"it costs a lot to smoke, bills are increasing so i need to cut back where possible, i also have children and i want to be healthier for them"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4695,"You're facing some real financial pressures, and with your bills increasing, it makes sense to look for places to cut back. At the same time, your children are clearly important to you, and you want to be healthy for them. It sounds like both your financial situation and the desire to be a healthier parent are pushing you towards change. How do you feel about this?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4696,yes that is very correct
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4697,"It seems like you've got some strong reasons to consider quitting, both for your family's future and your own well-being. How do you feel about the possibility of making this change?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4698,"very negative, i have tried lots of things but have been unsuccessful"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4699,"It sounds like you've put a lot of effort into trying to quit, and it's understandable to feel discouraged when things don't go as hoped. Your persistence shows how important this is to you. What do you think has been the most challenging part about quitting in the past?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4700,"stress, i find smoking a relaxing habit"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4701,"Stress can be a powerful trigger, and smoking often becomes a way to manage those moments. It's understandable that it feels like a relaxing habit amidst everything else going on in your life. Besides smoking, have there been other ways you've found helpful to cope with stress?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4702,no unfortunately not
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4703,"That must be quite challenging, having relied on smoking as a primary way to handle stress without having other outlets. The idea of quitting might feel daunting without alternatives. What would it mean for you to find new ways to manage stress that feel helpful?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4704,it would be very helpful to have something else to depend on and help
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4705,"It could make a big difference to have other strategies in place. Having support and alternatives can empower you to make the change you want. Is there anything specific you have in mind, or would you like to explore some possibilities together?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4706,i have no idea on what to try
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4707,"That's okay! It's completely normal not to have all the answers right away. We can explore some simple, practical strategies that might fit into your life. Before we dive into that, is there anything else related to smoking or your reasons for quitting that you'd like to talk about?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4708,no thank you
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4709,"Great, then let's take a moment to summarize our conversation. You've shared that both financial concerns and the desire to be a healthy parent are important reasons for you wanting to quit smoking. You've encountered challenges with stress, which has made quitting difficult in the past, and right now, you're open to exploring new ways to manage stress. Are you open to discussing some ideas to help cope with stress and support you in quitting smoking?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4710,yes please
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4711,"Thank you for being open to exploring some new ideas. We can take a look at a few stress management techniques that might suit you, like deep breathing exercises, going for a walk, or even finding a hobby that you enjoy and can relax with—something that could gradually replace the routine of smoking. How do these options sound to you?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4712,yes very positive
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4713,"That's encouraging to hear! Perhaps we can start with just one of these options and see how it works for you. Since these sounds positive, do any of them stand out as something you'd like to try first?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4714,"i may try crafting, i usually enjoy this. but finding simple but effective crafts can be a struggle"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4715,"Crafting sounds like a wonderful choice, especially since it's something you already enjoy. It can be a relaxing and rewarding way to channel your energy. We can explore simple projects that don't require too much time or materials, something you can easily fit into your routine. Would it help to gather some resources or ideas to get you started?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4716,yes please
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4717,"Absolutely! There are plenty of online resources with simple craft ideas, like using old magazines for collages, simple jewelry making, or even decorating items you already have, like picture frames. Websites like Pinterest or craft blogs can offer lots of inspiration. Starting small and building on what you enjoy could make a difference. Does this feel manageable for you?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4718,yes it does thank you
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4719,"You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Crafting can be a wonderful outlet, and it's great to see you're open to trying something new. Remember, it's perfectly okay to take it one step at a time. Do you feel there's anything else you'd like to prepare or talk about as you begin this new approach?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4720,no thats great thank you
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,counsellor,4721,"Thank you for the conversation today. I want to take a moment to go over what we've discussed. We've talked about how both financial concerns and the desire to be healthier for your children are driving your thoughts about quitting smoking. You've shared that stress is a major challenge for you, and smoking has been a way to cope with that. Together, we've looked at crafting as a possible stress-relief activity to replace smoking, and it sounds like you're excited to explore this further. You also mentioned wanting to find simple and effective crafting projects, and we talked about using online resources for inspiration. I appreciate your openness and readiness to try new things. Remember, taking it one step at a time can lead to significant changes. If there's ever anything more you'd like to discuss, feel free to reach out.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
155,615d9f86fdd5e127d783e850,client,4722,No
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4723,Hello there! I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling?
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4724,Great thank you. How are you?
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4725,"I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How would you like to spend this time together today?"
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4726,Talk about smoking
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4727,"Sure, we can definitely do that. It sounds like smoking is something that's on your mind. What's been your experience with smoking recently?"
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4728,I would like to stop
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4729,"That's a big decision, and it sounds like you're really considering making some changes. What are some of the reasons that have led you to think about stopping smoking?"
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4730,To be more healthy and to save money
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4731,Those are really important reasons. Taking care of your health and finances can have a big impact on many areas of your life. What are some of the things you're hoping to achieve by making this change?
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4732,To improve my overall health and put aside money spent on cigarettes into my bank account
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4733,You're envisioning a future where you feel healthier and have more financial security. Those are powerful motivators. What are some things that have helped you think about making this change now?
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4734,Prayer
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4735,It's great that you have a source of strength and support through prayer. It can be really valuable to have something that grounds you as you consider making this change. What role has prayer played in your journey with smoking so far?
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4736,Making me want to stop
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4737,"Prayer has been a guiding force, helping you feel the desire to quit smoking. It's wonderful to have something so meaningful supporting your journey. What other aspects of your life do you think might change if you decide to stop smoking?"
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4738,I'll feel more invigorated
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4739,Feeling more invigorated sounds like a great outcome you're looking forward to. Having more energy and vitality could enhance your day-to-day life. Are there any other changes you anticipate or hope for once you stop smoking?
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4740,none
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4741,"You've got some clear and motivating reasons for wanting to stop smoking, like feeling more invigorated and the benefits of better health and financial savings. Is there anything else you’d like to explore or talk about before we think about any possible next steps?"
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4742,no not at all
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,counsellor,4743,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let's summarize what we've talked about so far. You're considering stopping smoking to be healthier and to save money, and you're motivated by the prospect of feeling more invigorated. Prayer has been an important support in encouraging you toward this change. These are significant reasons and sources of strength as you think about the future. It's been great exploring these thoughts with you today.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
156,639a377ae81184e896e1daaf,client,4744,No
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4745,"Hello there! It's great to see you today. I hope you're feeling comfortable. I'm really interested in hearing your thoughts and experiences, whatever you feel like sharing at the moment. How's your day going so far?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4746,Fine
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4747,I'm glad to hear that. I appreciate you coming in today. What's been on your mind recently that you'd like to talk about?
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4748,"Nothing in particular, I thought I would be responding to questions from you."
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4749,"I can understand that. Well, we can certainly start with some questions to get the conversation going. What is your experience with smoking these days? Is it something you think about often?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4750,It's certainly something I indulge in often.
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4751,It sounds like smoking is a regular part of your life right now. What role do you feel it plays for you?
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4752,"Mild high, relaxation, time-out from things. And obviously physical addiction."
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4753,"So, smoking offers you a mix of things: a sense of relaxation, a break from the hustle and bustle, and there's the physical aspect of addiction that keeps it going. How do you feel about the way smoking is affecting your day-to-day life?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4754,Financially it's currently very expensive and I know it does no favours healthwise.
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4755,You're noticing the financial strain it brings and the health concerns that come with it. Those seem to weigh on you. How do you manage those thoughts and feelings when they come up?
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4756,Im generally too busy to dwell on them overly.
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4757,"So amidst a busy life, these concerns sometimes get pushed aside. It seems like you're juggling a lot, and there isn't always time to focus on these thoughts. How do you feel about the balance between smoking's benefits and costs in your life?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4758,Not smoking would certainly be better but the benefits I lifted above mean that Im not taking time to make an effort.
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4759,"It sounds like there's a clear acknowledgment of the benefits you would gain by not smoking, yet the immediate comforts it provides seem to hold you back from making that effort. It's as if you're caught in a tug-of-war between the relief it gives you and the longer-term benefits of quitting. How do you feel about exploring this ambivalence further together?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4760,If you like.
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4761,Thank you. I think it can be really helpful to look at both sides of the equation. What are the things that come to mind when you imagine life without smoking?
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4762,"More money, better health, no release from present or signigicant time out from responsibilities."
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4763,"You envision potential positives like saving money and improving your health. On the other hand, concerns about losing the release and the time-out that smoking provides seem significant to you. There seems to be a strong mix of thoughts you are juggling about this potential change. Where do you think we should go from here in this conversation?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4764,I don't know. I feel self aware about the pros and cons but do not feel in a current situation to act upon them.
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4765,"You have a clear understanding of the pros and cons, and at this moment, it feels like there might be too many barriers or not the right circumstances for acting on this awareness. That's completely okay. Sometimes just talking things through without feeling pressured to act can be beneficial. Is there anything else you would like to discuss in exploring your relationship with smoking today?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4766,No
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,counsellor,4767,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's go over what we've talked about. We explored your current experiences with smoking and the role it plays in your life, giving you moments of relaxation and a break. You shared your awareness of its costs, such as the financial strain and potential health issues. We acknowledged the tension between the short-term relief smoking provides and the longer-term benefits of quitting, like saving money and better health. Though acting on these thoughts isn't something you're ready for right now, you were open about exploring this ambivalence. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this balance. Let's keep this door open for future conversations whenever you're ready.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
157,667a7ab2a6179deb78e9dd1a,client,4768,No
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4769,Hello there! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling as we get started with our conversation?
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4770,pretty guilty
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4771,Thank you for being honest about how you’re feeling. Guilt can be a tough emotion to navigate. Would you like to tell me a bit more about what's been going on that's making you feel this way?
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4772,I have been trying to quit smoking and it is very hard for me. I promised my significant other I will quit it within an year and i find it hard to do so.
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4773,"Quitting smoking can indeed be a challenging journey, and it's understandable to feel guilty when it's not going as planned. It sounds like there's a lot at stake for you, especially with the promise you made to your significant other. What are some of the things that make it hard for you to quit?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4774,"My social circle smokes. From my friends to work colleagues. Books I read talks about smoking, movies I watch shows smoking. Which triggers me to buy cigarettes and vapes."
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4775,"It seems like smoking is deeply embedded in various parts of your life, from the people around you to the media you consume. This environment can make your attempts to quit feel even more challenging. What do you think might help you in dealing with these triggers?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4776,Cutting them off till I get ahold of myself which is very hard to do.
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4777,"Disengaging from parts of your social circle and routine that encourage smoking seems like a difficult but proactive step to take. The idea of distancing yourself, even temporarily, to focus on your goal shows a strong desire to change. Would you like to explore some specific strategies or steps that might make this idea a bit more manageable for you?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4778,Yes
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4779,"Before we start planning, is there anything else on your mind regarding your journey to quit smoking or anything else you'd like to discuss?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4780,"As of now, nothing."
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4781,"Great. Let's take a moment to summarize what you've shared with me: You're feeling a strong desire to quit smoking, motivated in part by your promise to your significant other. You're facing difficulty due to the influence of your social circle and the media that includes smoking, acknowledging the idea of cutting them off to gain more control. And now, you're open to exploring strategies to make these changes more manageable. Is there anything else you'd like to add or adjust to that summary? Once you're comfortable with this, we can move on and start discussing some strategies."
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4782,This sounds right
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4783,"Thank you for confirming. With your permission, let’s explore some strategies together that might help you navigate these challenges. Would that be okay with you?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4784,the summary sounds good
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4785,"Wonderful. Since you've mentioned that cutting off certain influences for a while could be helpful, one approach might be to gradually limit your contact with those triggers, starting with small changes. For example, you could find activities or places where smoking isn’t common and spend more time there. You might also consider sharing your goal with your friends and colleagues, so they can offer support or reduce smoking around you. What are your thoughts on starting with these small, manageable steps?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4786,"I can avoid my friends for few weeks, but it is going to be hard for me to avoid my workplace colleagues."
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4787,"It's understandable that some situations, like at work, may be harder to navigate. Perhaps you could try finding alternative activities during breaks, like taking a walk or spending time in a different area. It might also be helpful to have some supportive coping strategies ready for those moments. Is there someone at work you trust who you could talk to about your goal, perhaps even engage in non-smoking activities together during breaks?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4788,My manager. He is trying to quit as well.
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4789,"Connecting with your manager, who is also working on quitting, could be a great source of support and motivation for both of you. You might consider partnering up to create a supportive environment at work where you can help each other manage cravings and triggers. How do you feel about possibly talking with your manager about joining forces in this effort?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4790,Pretty positive
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4791,"That’s encouraging to hear. Collaborating with your manager could offer both of you mutual support and accountability. As you consider reaching out, what would be the first step you'll take to initiate this conversation with your manager?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4792,Schedule a meeting and talk about how hard it is to quit smoking and ask to work remotely for the timebeing.
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4793,"Scheduling a meeting to discuss your challenges and explore options like remote work shows a proactive and thoughtful approach. It can be a good opportunity to express how important quitting is for you and how you both might support each other in this endeavor. Once you take this step, it might pave the way for more strategies to help you both move toward your goals. How do you feel about taking this initiative?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4794,Pretty enticed
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4795,"That sounds promising! Taking this step could be a significant boost in your journey to quit smoking. Remember, it's all about taking one step at a time and seeking support where you can. If there's anything more you'd like to explore or any other concerns you have as you move forward, feel free to reach out. How about setting up a follow-up session to see how everything's going?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4796,"Yes, I would be able to do that"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4797,"Great! We'll schedule a follow-up session to check in on your progress and discuss how things are going with your manager and other strategies you're trying. You've shown a lot of courage and insight today. Take care of yourself, and I'm looking forward to hearing how things unfold for you. Stay positive and take it one step at a time!"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4798,Thank you!
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4799,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You've expressed the challenge of quitting smoking, especially with the influence of your social circle and media. We've explored the idea of distancing yourself from some of these triggers temporarily, a strategy you feel you can apply with your friends but recognize as more challenging at work. We've looked into the potential support from your manager, who shares a similar goal, and you're planning to take initiative by scheduling a conversation with him about possibly working remotely. You're feeling positive about taking this step and we're set to follow up to see how these strategies unfold. I'm inspired by your willingness to explore these ideas and your proactive approach. Looking forward to supporting you further in your journey.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4800,"Yes, let's continue."
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4801,"Great! Is there anything else specific you'd like to explore right now, or any other concerns you'd like to discuss as you work toward quitting smoking?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4802,"If I cut off my friends for few weeks, Medias are the only one hobby killer. How do I go through movies or books that triggers my smoking urges"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4803,"Dealing with media that triggers smoking urges can be challenging, especially if these are activities you enjoy. Starting with a mindful approach to what you consume might help. You might find it beneficial to explore other genres or storylines that don’t prominently feature smoking. This could be a chance to discover new interests that keep your mind engaged without rekindling the urge to smoke.

Additionally, structuring your environment to minimize exposure, such as using streaming services or following book recommendations that are less likely to include smoking scenes, could help reinforce your commitment.

If you're watching something and a smoking scene appears, even practicing deep breathing exercises or having a go-to distraction, like a puzzle or a different hobby, might support you in managing your urges.

How do you feel about trying some of these options, or is there another approach you might consider?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4804,I feel pretty good trying the breathing exercise.
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4805,"Breathing exercises can be a calming and empowering tool during moments when urges arise. When faced with a trigger, taking slow, deep breaths can help anchor you and reduce cravings. It can also be a moment to remind yourself of the reasons you're working to quit. Would you like to practice a particular breathing technique, or do you have a method in mind that you'd like to adopt?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4806,I'd love to practise a popular breathing technique.
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4807,"One effective technique is the 4-7-8 method, which can be both calming and grounding. Here's how it works:

1. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.
2. Close your eyes and breathe in quietly through your nose for a count of four.
3. Hold your breath for a count of seven.
4. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound, for a count of eight.
5. This completes one cycle. Try repeating it three more times for a total of four breaths.

This technique can be a helpful tool to use whenever you encounter triggers or feel the urge to smoke. Would you like to try this out now, or at your own pace later on?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4808,right now
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4809,"Let's try it together. Take a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Here we go:

1. Inhale through your nose for a count of four. 1... 2... 3... 4.
2. Hold your breath for a count of seven. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7.
3. Exhale through your mouth for a count of eight, making a gentle whoosh sound. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.

Feel free to repeat this three more times at your own pace. Take your time and notice any shifts in how you're feeling. Let me know how it goes for you."
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4810,It went well
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4811,"That’s good to hear! Using this technique anytime you feel a smoking urge, whether during media exposure or in daily life, can be a calming anchor. It's great to have these practical tools in situations that feel challenging. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or practice together today?"
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,client,4812,Thats all for now.
158,64807f91bd90462348c5d01b,counsellor,4813,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. Our conversation has reached its intended length, and I'd like to summarize what we've talked about to wrap things up.

You've shared your goal of quitting smoking and some challenges you've faced, like the influence of your social circle and media, and the difficulty in keeping your promise. We explored strategies such as temporarily reducing contact with smoking friends and engaging in supportive conversations with your manager at work, who is also aiming to quit smoking. You expressed positivity about setting a meeting with your manager, possibly exploring remote work.

Additionally, we addressed media triggers by considering new genres and practicing the 4-7-8 breathing technique, which you found helpful in managing urges.

It's inspiring to see your willingness to take proactive steps, like scheduling a meeting and tackling triggers, as you move forward. Should you like to explore more strategies or discuss further progress later, feel free to reach out. Wishing you strength and peace as you continue your journey.

Take care and see you next time!"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4814,Hi there! I'm glad to see you today. How has your day been so far?
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4815,"its been good, thanks"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4816,That's great to hear. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on during our time together today? Or would you prefer we just get started and see where our conversation takes us?
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4817,lets get started
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4818,Alright. I'm here to support you wherever you're at in your journey. How have things been going for you in terms of smoking? Anything specific on your mind related to that?
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4819,I know its bad for my health and i'd eventually want to quit
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4820,"You're aware of the impact smoking has on your health, and it sounds like there's a part of you that wants to make a change. How do you feel about that right now? Are there things that make you want to keep smoking?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4821,I feel conflicted
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4822,"It sounds like you're experiencing some internal conflict about smoking. On one hand, you recognize the health risks and have a desire to quit, but on the other hand, there might be things that make it tough to let go. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel conflicted?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4823,"smoking has become some sort of relief. It soothes me, helps me relax and foccus. It become a part of me"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4824,"Smoking has taken on an important role in helping you manage stress and focus, almost becoming a part of your routine and identity. With all that it provides, it must be challenging to think about giving it up. What do you think would be the hardest part of not having smoking as that source of relief?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4825,How to cope
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4826,"Coping without smoking seems uncertain and maybe a bit daunting to you. Since smoking has offered you relaxation and focus, figuring out new ways to fulfill those needs is something that's on your mind. Are there any other situations or feelings that you think smoking helps with?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4827,It helps with my anxiety
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4828,"Smoking has been a way for you to handle anxiety, providing some relief when things feel overwhelming. Dealing with anxiety without that familiar comfort might feel like an unsettling thought. What has your experience with anxiety been like, with or without smoking?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4829,"Before my emotion was all over the place, difficulty concentrating,tightness in my chest, sweating etc"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4830,"Before, it sounds like your anxiety would manifest through a range of intense physical and emotional sensations, which must have been quite difficult to manage. Smoking seems to have helped you find some balance amid that internal chaos. How are you feeling about the idea of seeking out other ways to address those anxiety symptoms?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4831,My worry is how to succeed without having full blown episodes without it
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4832,Your concern about experiencing intense anxiety episodes without the relief that smoking provides is completely understandable. You're thinking about how to navigate these powerful feelings in a way that feels manageable. It sounds like finding effective coping strategies is important to you. What would success look like for you when managing anxiety without smoking?
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4833,coping and nibbing it right at the onset on my anxiety sign
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4834,"Success for you would mean being able to recognize the early signs of anxiety and having strategies in place to address them right away, so things don't escalate. Having that sense of control over your anxiety is something you value. Is there anything you've tried in the past, other than smoking, that has helped with those early signs?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4835,This is embarassing but I chewed on paper
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4836,"You found an inventive way to cope by chewing on paper, and I'm here to hold a non-judgmental space for you as we explore what works best for you. It's great that you discovered a method that provided some comfort. Is there something about that action that you think made it effective for you?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4837,I dont know what exactly but before I started smoking that helped eventhough i dont understand how
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4838,"Even if you're not exactly sure why, you found that chewing on paper helped you manage anxiety before smoking was part of your routine. It's interesting to explore how seemingly small actions can have a grounding effect. Are there any feelings or thoughts you have about returning to this or trying something similar to see if it might offer some relief now?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4839,I can try going back to that but how safe is that too
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4840,"Your health and safety are clearly priorities for you in thinking about ways to cope. Considering the method you use is understandable. Exploring alternatives that might feel both effective and safe is worth thinking about. Have you ever tried or considered other small actions or techniques that could provide relief, or would you be open to exploring more options?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4841,No. The only alternative i know is paper and that too I am not sure if it might work for me now
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4842,"You're feeling unsure about how well the paper-chewing would work for you now, and it's the only method you know of as an alternative. Finding the right strategies can take some exploring and experimenting. Would you be interested in talking about other techniques or methods that might support you in feeling more at ease with your anxiety?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4843,yes
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4844,"Great! We can explore some different techniques together. Some people find that breathing exercises, physical activity, or mindfulness practices like meditation can be helpful in managing anxiety. Others find comfort in creative activities or reaching out for support. Would any of these options resonate with you as something to try or learn more about?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,client,4845,"What happens when i am in public or in th office and i sense an episode coming. Typically i would just excuse myself for a quick smoke. With all the suggested activities youve stated, how will itwork?"
159,6716de054706a11c5ad2dcb9,counsellor,4846,"Thank you for sharing your time with me today. We've covered quite a bit together, and I want to make sure I capture what's important for you. You've expressed feeling conflicted about quitting smoking because it provides relief for your anxiety and stress, and you're worried about finding other effective ways to cope, especially in public or work settings. We've discussed how some small actions, like chewing paper, used to help you, though you're unsure about its current effectiveness and safety. You've shown interest in exploring new strategies like breathing exercises, mindfulness, or other techniques that could work for you.

As you navigate these feelings and explore new options, know that you're taking some meaningful steps toward understanding and managing your anxiety in a way that aligns with your health goals. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss or if you're ready, we can explore these strategies more deeply next time. Thank you again for your openness."
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4847,"Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about being here, and is there anything specific you'd like to explore or talk about during our time together?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4848,Im feeling intrigued Id like to find out methods to stop smoking
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4849,"It's great to hear that you're intrigued and open to exploring this topic. Quitting smoking is a journey, and it's a positive step that you're considering it. Before we dive into methods, what are some of the reasons you feel motivated to stop smoking, and are there any concerns or hesitations you have about it?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4850,"for health reasons and financial reasons, I don't want to feel uncomfortable from withdrawal makes me hesitate"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4851,"Your health and finances are important, and it's understandable to want to improve those areas. At the same time, the thought of withdrawal can be pretty daunting and uncomfortable. Balancing these reasons with the fear of withdrawal must be challenging. What have you tried to do in the past, or what thoughts have you had about managing withdrawal if you were to quit?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4852,I've used vapes to try and quit however I find I end up using those the same amount if not more. I'm not really sure on a good method
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4853,"You've already taken the step of trying to switch to vapes, and it's frustrating when it doesn't feel like progress. It seems like you're seeking an approach that really works for you and helps you reduce or quit rather than just switching to something else. What do you think would make an approach appealing or effective for you?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4854,I think if it could distract or redirect me in some way
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4855,Having something that could capture your attention and redirect your focus could be really beneficial. Finding activities or strategies that effectively keep your mind engaged might make a transition away from smoking feel more manageable. Are there specific activities or interests that you think could serve as a good distraction or help shift your focus?
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4856,"I've started learning to knit which might be helpful if I use my hands, I'm not sure how to replace the habit of hand to mouth though"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4857,"Learning to knit is a wonderful idea—it's a creative and hands-on activity that keeps your hands busy. The hand-to-mouth habit is tough since it's such a big part of smoking. It's a common challenge. Maybe there's a way to incorporate knitting into times when you feel the urge to smoke, using it as an outlet. What do you think could be some small steps you might try to practice this, or is there anything else you'd like to adjust about your approach?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4858,i think it would only be practical some of the time I would need something else as you cant knit everywhere
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4859,"That makes sense. Knitting can be a great fit in some situations, but having other options would be helpful, especially for times or places where knitting isn't practical. It sounds like having a variety of strategies might be a good way to tackle different moments throughout your day. What other activities or methods have you thought about that might help shift away from the hand-to-mouth habit?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4860,maybe lollipops? do you have any suggestions?
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4861,"Lollipops could work nicely for the hand-to-mouth habit, providing an oral substitute without smoking. Before I suggest anything, would you like to hear some ideas about other strategies that work for some people, or is there something else you'd prefer to explore first?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4862,yes please
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4863,"Great! Some people find chewing gum or using a stress ball helpful. For others, drinking water with a straw or having small snacks can fill that hand-to-mouth routine. It’s about finding what feels comfortable and natural for you. Do any of these options resonate with you, or is there another approach you'd like to consider?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4864,I quite like the idea of using a straw or chewing gum as these seem quite practical and easy to incorporate
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4865,"Incorporating a straw or chewing gum sounds like a practical approach, especially since they can easily fit into different parts of your day. Starting with something that feels simple and manageable could be a helpful step forward. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore further before we consider how you might start incorporating these ideas?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4866,no help me consider how to incorporate the ideas
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4867,"Alright. Let's take a moment to think about when and where you typically find yourself reaching for a cigarette. Would you be comfortable sharing some of those situations, and we can brainstorm how the straw or gum might fit into those moments?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4868,I use cigarettes mostly in the evening as I use a vape throughout the day. I tend to reach for them mostly after food or with coffee
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4869,"It sounds like evenings, after meals, and with coffee are significant moments for you. Since those are key times, maybe you could start by trying to replace cigarettes with a straw or gum during one of these times. How do you feel about that, and what might work best for you to focus on first—after meals or with coffee?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4870,probably after meals
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4871,"Starting with after meals could be a great choice. It's a specific moment you can plan for and practice. You might try having a straw or gum with you and using it as soon as you finish eating, focusing on the change. It might take some practice, but small steps can lead to progress. How does that sound, and is there anything you’d like to prepare or plan for this change?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4872,I think this sounds quite manageable. I also like the idea of any small step being a positive change. I think I'll start having more gum around and buy some metal straw I've been meaning to anyway
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4873,"That’s a wonderful plan. Having gum and a metal straw ready gives you a solid foundation for making this positive change. Embracing small steps can help you build confidence and momentum. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or explore to prepare, or do you feel ready to give this a try?"
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,client,4874,I feel ready to give this a try
160,66fc6008cda3d277a8978dbf,counsellor,4875,"Thank you for our conversation today and for sharing your thoughts and feelings openly. We've talked about your desire to stop smoking, driven by concerns about health and finances, and the hesitation around withdrawal symptoms. You mentioned using vapes and your efforts to find an effective method. You've come up with some great ideas, like engaging in an activity such as knitting, and we explored substitutes that might fit various situations, like using a straw or chewing gum, especially after meals. Preparing to have these readily available is a positive step you're ready to take.

161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,counsellor,4878,"I really appreciate your willingness to talk about this important topic. Before diving into more detailed discussions on quitting, it might be helpful to explore what's been leading you to consider making this change. Can you tell me a little about what smoking means to you and what your reasons might be for wanting to quit?"

It's understandable that it could feel like something you rely on during tough times. At the same time, you mentioned you’re thinking about quitting. What might be some reasons you're considering that change?"
161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,client,4881,"because it has become a habit and as a father, i wont want my kids to learn that"
161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,counsellor,4882,"You're thinking about the kind of example you want to set for your children, and it's important to you that they don't pick up smoking. That speaks to the sense of responsibility and care you have as a parent. Balancing that with your own needs for easing pain and stress must be quite a challenge. How do you feel about navigating between those responsibilities?"
161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,client,4883,"neutral, i have to do the best i can"

What have you found helpful to focus on or remember as you work through these challenges?"
161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,client,4885,"neutral, i have to try my best"
161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,counsellor,4886,"You have this unwavering dedication to trying your best, even amidst feelings of neutrality. That determination is really significant. It sounds like you're in a place where you're weighing the pros and cons of smoking in your life. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about in relation to smoking and what it means for you?"
161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,client,4887,"none, but i love chatting with you, it helped me feel better"
161,6720fcc32cb6d4413e8643b0,counsellor,4888,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. Let’s take a moment to go over what we've discussed. We talked about how smoking has been a way for you to manage pain and stress, which is a significant part of your life.

I'm here to listen, and I'm really eager to hear more about what brings you in and how I can support you. When you're ready, feel free to share anything you'd like to talk about or explore."
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4891,I am here to talk about my smoking behaviours as you were instructed to know about me.
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4892,Thank you for sharing that. It's a good starting point. What would you be most interested in exploring today about your smoking habits? Is there something specific on your mind regarding your smoking?
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4893,Well there is nothing specific because smoking has been a habit about me
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4894,"I hear you—smoking has become a part of your routine. Are there any aspects of this habit that you find yourself thinking about? For example, things you enjoy or things you might wish were different?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4895,"I don't know, I mostly smoke when I am stressed and sometimes too if I feel like"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4896,"It sounds like smoking is a way for you to cope with stress and also something you choose to do when you simply feel like it. How do you feel about that pattern? Is there anything about it that you'd like to change, or are you comfortable with it as it is?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4897,I feel comfortable with it especially now that it is cold outside
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4898,"It makes sense that smoking might feel comforting, especially during colder times. It can provide a sense of relief or warmth in more ways than one. Do you ever notice any downsides to smoking, or do the comforts usually outweigh any concerns for you?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4899,"I do not experience any downsides, I sometimes sleep after smoking"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4900,"It's good to hear that you're not experiencing any immediate downsides, and it seems like smoking might help you unwind or relax. Sometimes knowing what works for you can be useful. Do you have any thoughts or feelings about what role smoking will have in your life moving forward?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4901,"Maybe, can you give me some negative aspect of smoking incase I have to reduce the number of times I have to smoke"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4902,"I appreciate your curiosity about the potential downsides. Before I share any information, is it okay if we talk about that? And also, I'm curious if there's something in particular that makes you consider reducing how often you smoke?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4903,"No, nothing particular. You are making me curious wanting to know if there is anything negative about smoking. I am asking based on the questions you asked earlier"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4904,"I see, you're exploring this out of curiosity, which is a great way to learn and reflect. There are a few known health concerns related to smoking, such as an increased risk for respiratory issues or cardiovascular problems over time. But also, people sometimes feel a financial burden or social pressure, which might impact their decision. How do you feel about hearing this information?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4905,This is quiet devasted..
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4906,"I can understand how hearing that might be unsettling. It's a lot to consider, especially when a habit feels like a part of your life. I'm here to support you through any thoughts or feelings you may have about this. What's on your mind now that we've explored a few of these negative aspects?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4907,I guess I have reduce my smoking habits then so that I do not put my life at risk
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4908,"That's a thoughtful decision, considering what you've learned. Reducing smoking could potentially lead to a positive impact on your health and well-being. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or consider as we explore this idea further? If you're ready, we can think about any small steps you might want to take toward reducing smoking."
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4909,Yes I am ready
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4910,"Great! Before we move forward, let me briefly sum up what we've talked about so far. You've mentioned that smoking helps with stress and relaxation, especially during colder weather, although you recognize some potential downsides like health risks. You're curious and open to exploring the idea of reducing your smoking to minimize those risks.

With that in mind, would it be okay if we brainstorm some small, manageable steps you might take toward reducing your smoking?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4911,Yes
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4912,"Alright, let's explore some options together. One small step might be to identify certain times or situations where you usually smoke and see if you can cut back during those times. Another approach could be to try replacing a cigarette with another relaxing activity, like a walk or listening to music.

Are there any ideas that come to mind for you, or any particular step you'd like to start with?"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,client,4913,"Yes, maybe take a walk or eat snacks when I feel like smoking"
162,66c53f6e53501f126905fa7c,counsellor,4914,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. Our conversation has reached its intended length, and I'd like to summarize what we've discussed so far.

We've talked about your smoking habits and how smoking is a way for you to relax and manage stress, especially during cold weather. There have also been moments when we've considered the potential health risks associated with smoking. You've expressed curiosity about these risks, which led you to contemplate the idea of reducing your smoking. 

I'm glad we were able to explore some small steps toward change, like taking a walk or eating snacks when you feel the urge to smoke. These are great ideas that align with your goals.

163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,client,4918,"Ive tried quitting many times, but it just never seems to stick."
163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,counsellor,4919,"You've put in a lot of effort trying to quit, showing you really care about making a change. It's frustrating when it doesn't stick, isn't it? What do you think has made it difficult for those attempts to last?"
163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,client,4920,"It is a stress reliever for me. Everytime I have tried to quit, other things in my life have come up and it helps me to calm down to deal with them"
163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,counsellor,4921,"Smoking seems to be a way for you to manage stress, especially when life throws challenges your way.

163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,counsellor,4925,"Smoking seems to provide a sense of relief for you, simplifying things when everything else feels complex and overwhelming.

What are some reasons you would like to quit, despite everything going on?"
163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,client,4926,My health and the appearance of my teeth are probably the main reasons i want to quit.

Even with the stress you're experiencing, these aspects stand out as significant to you. How does thinking about your health and appearance fit into the challenges you're facing right now?"
163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,client,4928,It makes me want to quit and just do it and get it over with

163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,client,4930,The next step is probably slowing down and smoking less in a day or getting a vape pen to alleviate some of the cravings.
163,668c4b63509df0f32d2b4a72,counsellor,4931,Considering ways to reduce your smoking or manage cravings with a vape pen shows you're already thinking about practical steps.

Despite these symptoms, it sounds like you're still very aware of the importance of quitting for your health. What keeps you motivated or hopeful during these challenging times?"
164,657113388b25e8ab178d80ac,client,4942,For my health and I promised my son that I would stop smoking

164,657113388b25e8ab178d80ac,counsellor,4947,"Having someone to talk to and receive encouragement from sounds incredibly valuable. It seems like that's a source of comfort and motivation for you, especially when things get tough. Speaking with your son might help reinforce your commitment and remind you of why you want to quit.

It's understandable to still be smoking some, as change can be a gradual process. What keeps you going with the smoking you still do, and what are your reasons for cutting down?"
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4982,Most of my nicotine needs are met by nicotine pouches but there's some cigarettes I gind hard to give up
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4983,"Balancing nicotine pouches with cigarettes shows you're trying to find a way that works for you. It can be tough when certain cigarettes are harder to let go of. What do those particular cigarettes mean to you, or what makes them especially difficult to quit?"
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4984,*
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4985,"Take your time to think about it. If you're comfortable sharing, I'm here to listen when you're ready."
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4986,Just certain times where only a cigarette hits the spot
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4987,"It seems like there are specific moments when a cigarette feels irreplaceable for you. These moments might hold a special significance or comfort. What stands out about those times, and how do they fit into your daily routine?"
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4988,Just habit like most things to do with cigarettes
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4989,"Habits can be deeply ingrained, especially when they're tied to certain routines or moments. It's understandable that they're a part of your daily pattern. What do you think about the idea of changing that habit? Do you see any benefits or challenges in doing so?"
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4990,I see it as a challenge but part of me doesn't want to give up one of the guaranteed pleasures of the day
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4991,"You're feeling torn between the comfort and pleasure smoking provides and the challenge of letting go of that habit. It's a common and understandable place to be, especially when something has become a reliable part of your day. What thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about what life might be like without those cigarettes?"
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4992,I''d eventuallt adjust but I wouldn't be happy about it
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4993,It's insightful to recognize that you might eventually adapt but also feel some reluctance about the change. It's okay to feel that way. What do you think could help make the adjustment smoother or more acceptable for you?
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4994,continue with the nicotine pouches and willpower and an actual desiere to stop
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4995,Continuing with nicotine pouches and relying on your willpower and desire to stop could be key components in your journey. Having a clear desire to quit might make a significant difference. What's your current motivation for considering cutting out those last few cigarettes?
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4996,I'm delaying it because of the already reduced levels
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4997,"It's understandable to feel that the progress you've made so far in reducing your levels gives you some pause before going further. You've come a long way, and that's something to be proud of. Is there anything more you want to explore or talk about related to these feelings or your journey so far? Perhaps something that could support you in feeling more ready when you're ready to take that next step?"
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,4998,I can't think of anything but maybe you have some ideas
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,4999,Thanks for opening up to the possibility. Here's one idea: sometimes it can be helpful to imagine the benefits you might experience in the future from quitting completely. This could involve thinking about how you'd like to feel or what you'd like to achieve by making this change. Would you be open to exploring these potential benefits or setting small goals to help with your journey?
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,5000,That's something I can look at in my own time
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,counsellor,5001,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You've made significant progress by reducing how much you smoke using nicotine pouches, but certain cigarettes remain harder to let go of because they fit so neatly into your habits. It can be challenging to consider giving up something that's been a consistent pleasure in your day, and you're aware that making such a change might involve some discomfort. But you've mentioned the importance of having a clear desire to stop and perhaps setting small goals for yourself to support this journey. You're open to thinking about potential benefits of quitting completely in your own time. This reflective journey is about finding what feels right for you. If there's anything else you'd like to explore or discuss in the future, I'm here for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
166,5daa50967776b10016e1bc9b,client,5002,No
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5003,Hello! I'm really pleased to have the opportunity to chat with you today. How are you feeling as we start this conversation?
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5004,I am ok
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5005,"I'm glad to hear that you're doing okay. As we get started, I'm here to listen to what's been on your mind lately. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about today, or perhaps how things have been going for you with smoking?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5006,I am still smoking but I need to quit based on health reasons but I like to smoke\
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5007,"You've got some mixed feelings about smoking. On one hand, you feel the need to quit for your health, and on the other hand, there's the enjoyment you still find in it. It sounds like this is a bit of a dilemma for you. Would you like to talk more about each side of how you're feeling?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5008,health wise its best to quit but on the other hand I do enjoy it.
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5009,"It sounds like you really value your health and recognize that quitting could be beneficial in that aspect, while at the same time there's an enjoyment factor with smoking that you're not quite ready to give up. What are some of the things you enjoy about smoking?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5010,It helps me relax during certain times of the day
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5011,Smoking seems to have become a way for you to find a bit of relaxation throughout your day. It's understandable how that could be appealing. How does smoking help you relax during those moments?
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5012,stress relief
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5013,"It offers you some relief from stress, serving as a way to cope when things might feel overwhelming. I'm curious, on the flipside, how do you notice your health being affected by smoking?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5014,I have wounds that will not heal and smoking slows down the healing process
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5015,"Having wounds that won't heal must be really frustrating, especially knowing that smoking might be playing a part in slowing that process down. It seems like there's a significant health concern there that's tied into your smoking experience. How does that impact your thoughts about quitting?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5016,I am conflicted
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5017,"It's completely understandable to feel conflicted. You have the desire to prioritize your health, particularly with the concerns about your wounds, yet smoking also provides you with stress relief. Balancing these feelings can be quite challenging. What matters most to you when you think about the reasons for quitting and the reasons for continuing to smoke?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5018,well my health but on the other hand I find benefits in smoking for other reasons
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5019,"Your health is a clear priority for you, yet you also find certain benefits in smoking that are significant in your daily life. It's as if you're weighing these pros and cons, trying to figure out what feels more important. What do you think would make any decision about smoking a bit clearer for you?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5020,I am not sure
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5021,"That's okay—not being sure is a normal part of the process. You're starting to explore these feelings, and that's an important step in itself. Maybe thinking about how you'd like your health and lifestyle to look in the future could offer some insights. What kind of changes, if any, would you envision for yourself in an ideal world?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5022,excersise and a balanced mind
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5023,The idea of exercising more and having a balanced mind holds a lot of value for you. It seems like these are aspects of your life that you're hoping to nurture. How do you see smoking fitting into or conflicting with that ideal vision?
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5024,its a conflict
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5025,"It seems that smoking stands in the way of the future you envision for yourself, with exercise and a balanced mind. Balancing these conflicting feelings is no easy task, and it shows that you care about the direction your life takes. Is there anything else on your mind you'd like to explore today?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5026,no not really
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,counsellor,5027,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today; I truly appreciate your openness. We've talked about your feelings of being conflicted when it comes to smoking—how on one side, there's your need to quit for health reasons, particularly the impact on your wound healing, and on the other, the enjoyment and stress relief smoking provides. You envision a future where exercise and a balanced mind play a key role, though smoking currently conflicts with that vision. Remember, exploring this conflict is an important step. As you reflect on our conversation, consider any insights that bring you closer to the changes you want to make. If you'd like, we can continue exploring these thoughts in our next session.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
167,628eb50c442d584fa8275bcc,client,5028,No
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5029,"Hello there! It's great to meet you. How are you doing today? I'm here to support you in whatever way feels most helpful right now, so feel free to share whatever's on your mind."

168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5031,"Thank you for sharing that with me. Feeling unsure about quitting smoking is completely understandable. It's a big change, and it can bring up a mix of emotions and thoughts. What does being unsure about quitting look like for you?"
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,client,5032,ive tried switvhing to a vape and still crave cigs
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5033,"It sounds like you've tried switching to vaping as a way to manage your cravings and move away from cigarettes, but the cravings are still there. That must be frustrating when you’re making an effort, yet the cravings persist. How do these cravings affect your routine or feelings throughout the day?"
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,client,5034,i have a one year old amoungst other daily tasks that can be hard without smoking
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5035,"Having a small child along with various daily responsibilities can certainly add a lot to your plate. Smoking may feel like a moment of relief or a break in the midst of everything going on. Balancing your desire to quit with those cravings, especially during such a busy time, can be challenging. What about those moments with your child and in your daily life helps motivate you to think about quitting?"
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,client,5036,i want to be healthy for hom
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5037,"Wanting to be healthy for your child is a powerful motivation. That shows just how much you care about your well-being and your child's future. It's inspiring to hear that desire. What does being healthier for your child look like to you, and how does that connect with your thoughts on smoking?"
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,client,5038,not smoking
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5039,Not smoking seems like a part of your vision for being healthier for your child. Imagining that change is important and shows you've thought about what you'd like to be different. What would be the best part about not smoking for you and your family?
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,client,5040,living a longer healthier lifestyle
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5041,"Living a longer, healthier lifestyle sounds like a meaningful goal for both you and your family. Thinking about being around for important moments in the future can be really motivating. What kind of support do you think would help you move toward that healthier, smoke-free lifestyle?"
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,client,5042,not sure
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5043,That's okay. Figuring out what support looks best for you can take some time and exploration. Perhaps just knowing that you want to make this change for your health and your child's future is a significant step already. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about regarding smoking or this journey towards being smoke-free?
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,client,5044,not currently
168,6605127afaa4fb7b48b5919f,counsellor,5045,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's recap what we've talked about so far. You've been feeling unsure about quitting smoking, and have tried switching to vaping but still experience cravings. Balancing this with the demands of your day, especially with a one-year-old, has been challenging. Your strong motivation to quit stems from wanting to be healthier for your child and ensuring a long and healthy future. We also discussed that living a healthier lifestyle and being present for life’s special moments with your family are important to you. Although you're not sure what specific support might help right now, knowing your goal is a powerful start. If anything else comes to mind, I'm here to help whenever you're ready to continue exploring this journey. 

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5047,Hi there! It's great to see you today. How are you feeling as we start our session together? Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about first?
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5048,no
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5049,That's okay. We're here to take things at your pace. Maybe you could tell me a little bit about your smoking – like when you usually smoke or how long you've been smoking. Whatever you're comfortable sharing.
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5050,smoke about a pack a day and have been for over 20 years
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5051,"Thank you for sharing that with me. Smoking has been part of your routine for a significant portion of your life. What do you like about smoking, and are there any parts of your smoking experience you aren't so fond of?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5052,smoke a pack a day
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5053,"Smoking a pack a day has become quite a routine for you. It sounds like it might be something that's deeply ingrained in your daily life. Are there specific moments or reasons when you find yourself reaching for a cigarette, or does it just feel like a constant habit?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5054,its a constant habit
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5055,"Having it as a constant habit can be pretty consuming, almost like it becomes automatic in your day. What's it like for you when you think about the idea of changing this routine or cutting back?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5056,not sure how I'm so used to it
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5057,Being so used to cigarettes over the years can make the thought of change seem daunting or uncertain. It can be challenging to imagine a day without your usual routine. What do you think might be the hardest part or the most rewarding part about considering a change?
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5058,hardest would be changing my routine and cravings
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5059,"Changing a routine, especially one that's been with you for so long, can feel overwhelming. And dealing with cravings is definitely tough. But thinking about that, what kind of positive changes do you imagine might arise in your life if you were to adjust your smoking habit?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5060,"feeling better, saving money, more time"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5061,"Those sound like some really rewarding benefits – feeling healthier, having extra cash, and more time for things you enjoy. It seems like these potential rewards are important to you. How do you feel about the challenges and benefits when you think about them side by side?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5062,benefits are best but the challenges seem overwhelming and to difficult
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5063,"It's completely normal to feel that way, where the benefits are appealing but the challenges feel daunting. It sounds like you're weighing these feelings carefully. What do you think might help in managing those overwhelming feelings when you think about taking steps towards change?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5064,I'm really not sure
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5065,It's alright not to have all the answers right now. Just acknowledging these feelings is an important step forward. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or explore together related to your smoking or anything else on your mind?
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5066,nothing I can think of
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5067,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. We've touched on the idea of smoking being a habit and the potential benefits of change, even though it feels overwhelming at times. Would it be alright if we explore some small steps or strategies that might ease the process if you decide to go down that path?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5068,sure
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5069,"Great! Let's consider what might be the most manageable starting points. A small change could simply be becoming more aware of when and why you smoke, or maybe setting aside a few minutes each day to think about your reasons for wanting to smoke less. Is there a particular small step that resonates with you or feels doable right now?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5070,maybe smoking a little less each day
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5071,"That's a thoughtful step to consider. Gradually reducing your smoking allows you to adjust without feeling too overwhelmed. It's about making things manageable and achievable. How do you feel about setting a small goal, like cutting back by one or two cigarettes each day, and seeing how that goes?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5072,that seems doable
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5073,"I'm glad to hear that feels doable for you. It's all about taking it one step at a time and seeing how it feels. If you're ready, we can check in on this in future conversations to see how it's going. Is there anything else about this plan, or anything else you'd like to discuss, as we wrap up for today?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5074,no thank you
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,counsellor,5075,"Thank you for sharing with me today. As a summary of our conversation, you've told me about your long-standing routine of smoking a pack a day and the challenge that change presents, especially facing cravings and adjusting your routine. We touched on the appealing benefits you'd see, like feeling better, saving money, and having more time. You considered a small step toward change by possibly reducing your smoking by one or two cigarettes each day, which feels manageable for you. This is a lot of meaningful reflection, and I'm here to support you whenever you're ready to talk again.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
169,65f860a1ab03181926bce465,client,5076,No
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5077,Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today? Is there anything you'd like to chat about to get us started?
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5078,"I'm feeling good, what would you like to talk about?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5079,"I'm here to focus on what's important to you. Since this is our first session, I’d love to get to know a bit more about you and your experiences. Maybe you could share any thoughts or feelings you have about smoking and what role it plays in your life right now?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5080,"It is a habit that I can't seem to quit. I have a need to have a cigarette in the morning and throughout the day, usually after eating."
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5081,"It sounds like smoking is something that has become part of your daily routine, especially at specific times like in the morning and after meals. On one hand, it seems like a familiar habit, but on the other hand, you're mentioning difficulty in quitting. What are some of the things that make smoking challenging to stop for you?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5082,"When I get stressed, I have a need to smoke to help relieve the stress."
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5083,"Smoking seems to be a way for you to cope with stress, providing a sense of relief in those moments. Yet, it also sounds like it's something you're thinking about quitting. What feelings or thoughts come up for you when you consider the idea of stopping smoking, especially when you feel stressed?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5084,I am starting to feel the effects of smoking on my health and I feel I really need to stop smoking altogether
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5085,"You're starting to notice the impact smoking is having on your health, and that seems to be creating a stronger drive to quit. At the same time, smoking has been a way to relieve stress for you. It shows you recognize something important about how smoking is affecting both your health and life overall. What changes have you observed in your health that are concerning to you?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5086,Breathing issues and coughing more as well as food does not taste the same.
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5087,"You've noticed changes like breathing issues, more frequent coughing, and even changes in how food tastes. These must be really frustrating experiences. It's clear these health changes are affecting your daily life, and it sounds challenging. How do you feel about these changes and what do they mean for you in terms of considering quitting smoking?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5088,It makes me aware that I have to quit as soon as possible before things get worse
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5089,"You're recognizing the urgency to make a change for your health, and it's driving a strong awareness of needing to quit. This sense of urgency is important, yet the idea of change can also bring up mixed feelings. Is there anything else you want to explore or discuss around these thoughts and feelings?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5090,I can't think of anything else
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5091,"You've shared a lot about your smoking habit, the impact on your health, and your desire to quit. It seems like you're seriously considering making a change for the sake of your health. Would it be alright with you if we start planning for some steps you could take toward quitting smoking?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5092,sure
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5093,"Great! Let's reflect on what we've talked about so far. You've mentioned that smoking is a stress reliever for you, but you're also feeling its negative effects, like breathing issues, coughing, and changes in taste. You're motivated to quit to protect your health. As we think about planning, what do you see as some first steps or possibilities that might help you move in the direction you want to go?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5094,"First I need to break the usual routine of my smoking, and if I still need to smoke do so in a non-regular routine period."
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5095,"Starting by breaking the routine and changing the times when you smoke seems like a practical first step. It can help reduce the automatic nature of reaching for a cigarette. You're approaching this with a thoughtful mindset. How do you feel about trying this initial step, and are there any specific strategies or support you think might be helpful as you begin?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5096,I have to intentionally break the routine and start making a new routine without cigarettes
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5097,"You've got a clear vision: to intentionally create a new routine without cigarettes. Changing your habits takes focus, and you're already setting the intention to do that. Making small adjustments and setting new daily patterns could really support this change. What are some activities or new habits you might want to incorporate into this new routine to help you move away from smoking?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5098,My usual activities but in a different order and in different ways.
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5099,"Reordering your usual activities and doing them differently is a creative approach to disrupting old habits. It allows you to create a fresh routine while staying engaged with things you enjoy. How do you feel about beginning with this strategy, and is there anything else you think could support you as you work on this change?"
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,client,5100,"I can't think of anything else, but this approach is something I can begin to do now."
170,66293a97afaf09c613477f83,counsellor,5101,"That sounds like a solid step forward, and it's great that you feel ready to start trying it out. As you begin to make these changes, remember that it's okay to experiment and see what works best for you.

171,644016409cd050fac990df20,client,5118,does it take years off your life
171,644016409cd050fac990df20,counsellor,5119,Smoking is known to have long-term effects on health and can indeed reduce life expectancy. This is because the harmful chemicals in cigarettes can lead to diseases that impact overall health. It's understandable that these concerns might weigh on your mind as you think about smoking. How do these thoughts affect your views on changing your smoking habits?
171,644016409cd050fac990df20,client,5120,what about black n milds

172,674063e8a4b1722a45be5cd9,counsellor,5145,"Great! We can explore what motivates your smoking and any thoughts you might have about the benefits and downsides. Often, people find it helpful to gain new perspectives and see where those might lead. If you were to reflect on what keeps you smoking versus any reasons you might want to change, what thoughts come to mind?"
172,674063e8a4b1722a45be5cd9,client,5146,I smoke when I think I want to escape reality and now it's a part of me. I don't think I have any reason to change now
172,674063e8a4b1722a45be5cd9,counsellor,5147,"Smoking feels like an important escape for you, a way to create a space that's separate from everyday life. It also feels like an integral part of who you are right now. It sounds like it's serving a specific purpose in your life. If the need to change ever arises in the future, is there something you think might prompt that decision?"
172,674063e8a4b1722a45be5cd9,client,5148,Maybe when I feel I have nothing bothering me anymore
172,674063e8a4b1722a45be5cd9,counsellor,5149,"I see. When you feel like life's pressures have eased and there's less you need to escape from, change might become a consideration. It's helpful to know what might prompt a shift in perspective for you. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any questions you have right now?"
172,674063e8a4b1722a45be5cd9,client,5150,None for now

You've conveyed that smoking provides a sense of escape and personal space, and it feels very much a part of who you are right now. You've also shared that there isn't presently anything making you consider changing your smoking habits, although you mentioned that if life's pressures were to ease, you might think differently about it. It's great that you've been open to this reflection, and I'm here to support you wherever you decide to go next with this.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
