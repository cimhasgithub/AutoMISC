5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. I'm curious to hear about your experience with smoking. What role does smoking play in your life right now?
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"i dont see smoking as a role in my life, but morea habit i cant quite shake off"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"Like a stubborn stain that's hard to get out, even when you know the fabric will look better without it."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"exactly that, yes"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"I really admire your self-awareness in recognizing this as a habit. That's an important first step and shows a lot of insight. I'm curious to know what has kept you going with smoking, despite recognizing it as a habit. What do you find keeps drawing you back to it?"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"in the mornings, i always enjoy a cup of tea first thing and when i am having my tea, it just seems natural to have a smoke with it"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"The morning routine with tea and a smoke feels comforting, but there might be a part of you wondering how things would be without reaching for that cigarette."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"i would like to get to that point, i just dont feel that i have the willpower at the moment"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"You feel like your willpower isn't strong enough to make the change right now, yet there's also a desire to reach a point where smoking isn't a part of your morning routine."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"yeah, i would say that, its like i just need that final push to get over the line and quit smoking"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,What do you think that final push might look like for you?
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,hopefully that push will see me stopping completely and not thinking about smoking again
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"You envision a future where smoking is no longer a thought or a part of your daily life, and making that final change feels like a significant milestone you're determined to reach."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,yes
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,Taking this step to talk things through and envision a future without smoking shows your courage and commitment to making a positive change in your life. What have been some of the biggest obstacles in your journey to quit smoking so far?
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"as i have said before, routine. Sometimes boredom and just sometimes I reach for a ciggie without really realising that I am"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,Tell me more about those moments when you reach for a cigarette without realizing it.
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"i could be talking to someone, and i would just light up, without taking their feelings into consideration"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"Reaching for a cigarette has become such an automatic action, sometimes happening without awareness."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"i would say so, yes"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"Smoking happens without thinking, almost like a reflex in social settings, yet there's a strong desire to break away from that automatic habit and be more mindful about your choices."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"that is the goal, eventually"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,What changes do you think would be most helpful in shifting away from those automatic moments of lighting up?
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"among other things, i need to get out more, I spend most of my time at home, so it is easier to smoke"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,Spending more time at home makes it easier to continue the habit.
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"yeah,"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,Getting out more could shift the environment and make it easier to break the cycle of reaching for cigarettes out of habit.
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"i suppose so, but not having tried that yet, i do not know if it will definitely work"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,What kinds of activities or places do you think could help you explore new routines outside of home?
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"i think if i knew that , then i would be going it already. Motivation to go and do things is difficult"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,What small steps could you explore that might help you find motivation for new activities?
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,i suppose maybe going for a walk in a nearby park
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"Going for a walk in the park could be a breath of fresh air, both physically and mentally, giving you a chance to clear your mind and experience small moments of change that could build motivation over time."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"it could help, but i just dont know if it will"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"Motivation feels hard to come by right now, yet the idea of enjoying a walk and experiencing something new appeals to your desire for change."
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,it does yes
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,What would it be like for you to explore that walk in the park and reflect on how you feel during and afterward?
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"i really do not know, that is a difficult question to answer"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,Reflecting on how you feel after the walk might open up new perspectives about what you truly enjoy or need.
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,client,"it might, or it might make me rush back home for a cigarette]"
5932e2c8b97ad00001745487,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. As our conversation comes to an end, let's reflect on what we've discussed. We explored how smoking has become an automatic habit for you, especially during your morning routine with a cup of tea, and how it sometimes happens without you realizing it in social settings. We've acknowledged the comfort and familiarity smoking provides, yet you also expressed a strong desire to reach a point where it's no longer part of your routine. You mentioned that motivation and finding alternative activities could help change the cycle, with the idea of going for a walk in the park as a starting point.

These reflections highlight your self-awareness and willingness to consider new possibilities, even as you recognize the challenges in shifting those well-established habits. When you're ready, exploring small changes and new activities could open up new ways of thinking about smoking and its role in your life. Please reach out anytime you feel like discussing this further. Thank you again for taking the time to talk with me."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm curious to know what role smoking currently plays in your life.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,I smoke when I wake until I go to sleep.  I usually get cravings within 45 minutes to an hour.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,What do you think mostly draws you to smoking?
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,It is relaxing to me and lessens my stress.  It is also a strong habit that I have had for most of my life.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,Smoking brings you relaxation and helps manage stress in your daily life.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,Yes it is a constant in my life and something that not only brings pleasure but is comforting.

61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,"Well the negatives are obviously that it is detrimental to my health.  It is also very expensive, but I have always budgeted it in"
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"Budgeting for cigarettes shows commitment to smoking, but there’s also the awareness of how it affects your health and finances in ways you may not like."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,I know that if I were able to overcome smoking and quit I would have more money to save and live longer
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"While cigarettes offer comfort and relaxation, you see the larger benefit in quitting—saving money and living longer."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,yes
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"What changes, if any, have you thought about making when it comes to smoking?"
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,I either quit or continue.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"Continuing smoking keeps the comfort and stress relief, yet there's a part of you considering the benefits of quitting for health and savings."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,I am probably not going to quit.  Maybe later I will re-evaluate
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"Quitting feels daunting and uncertain, but there's curiosity about what positive changes it might bring to your life."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,I have thought about it but I'm not considering it at the moment.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,I'd like to understand more about what makes quitting smoking feel like such a big challenge for you.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,The physical withdrawals are quite negative.  Aside from that I enjoy and it is part of my life
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"Quitting is challenging due to withdrawal and the enjoyment you get, yet you’re also weighing the idea of quitting for health and savings."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,"Yes I have weighed the idea of quitting, but I am still not at that point."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,It feels like giving up smoking would mean letting go of an important part of your identity and life routine.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,Yes.  I am open to it in the future.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,In what ways do you think smoking has shaped your daily life and routines over the years?

61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"Tell me, how do you imagine your life might change if you decided to quit smoking in the future?"
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,In the large scope I do not think my life would be a lot different on a day to day basis after I overcame quitting.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"Although you don't anticipate much day-to-day change after quitting, this could lead to finding joy and comfort in other ways."

61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"It's great to see openness in considering potential future changes, even as you acknowledge smoking's role in your life right now. What do you think would be the most significant motivator for you to reconsider quitting smoking in the future?"
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,Maybe if I were to have a child.
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"The idea of having a child could shift your priorities and bring a new perspective to your life choices, including smoking."
61071715ef66759482346ce4,client,That is likely the one thing that would make me stop
61071715ef66759482346ce4,counsellor,"Smoking has been a comforting routine in daily life, yet imagining having a child gives a powerful reason to reconsider quitting for their well-being."

663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,Thank you for joining me today. What are some of your current thoughts or feelings about smoking?
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,"I would love to quit smoking, but I find it extremely hard to tolerate the withdrawals and I especially cannot handle socialising with other smokers once I try to quit"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Handling social situations and withdrawal makes quitting daunting, yet the desire to quit signifies the importance of making a change."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,I only want to quit because the prices are too high for my income and this reason alone I think makes it hard to stay nicotine free
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Though quitting for financial reasons creates challenges, focusing on the desire to stop smoking could open doors to different motivations for change."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,"lately I have been feeling the physical effects of smoking (shortness or breath for example), so i could try to look at quitting from a health perspective"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,What would it mean for you if your health improved by quitting smoking?
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,"It would mean a lot of things, I would feel physically better, I wouldnt be out of breath as much, I would have decreased chances of illness etc"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Smoking has been a financial strain and now more physical effects are becoming apparent, focusing on health improvements could be a strong motivator for change."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,good idea. but sometimes i struggle with not caring about my health and then just smoking
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Sometimes the urge to smoke overwhelms, yet the value placed on improved health and feeling better holds significance."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,"whats tips do you have getting through the withdrawals, especially in times of high stress or habit (like with a coffee in the morning?)"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,Would you like some information about ways people manage stress and situations linked to smoking?
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,sure
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"When in highly stressful situations or tackling habits like coffee time with smoking, there are techniques such as deep breathing or finding a distraction that could help some people push through those moments. Reflecting on other comforting rituals for these instances might be supportive as well."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,These techniques have worked for me in the past.
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Those techniques have been useful in your past efforts, and they underscore your ability to find solutions during challenging times."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,My biggest challenge is hanging out with friends who smoke. It's very very hard to not smoke in these situations.
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"In what ways do your friendships play a part in your smoking patterns, and how could they support your desire for change?"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,"Well if they start smoking during a time when we hang out, I cant resist but smoke too"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Spending time with your friends, smoking can feel irresistible, but your desire to improve health shows your strong motivation for change."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,should i just not hang out with them until im strong enough to resist smoking with them?
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Choosing to manage social interactions comes with many considerations, and the responsibility and power to make choices that align with your goals ultimately rest with you. What do you think might happen if you tried to spend some time away from those smoking situations or approached them differently?"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,"If i didnt hang out with my smoker friends, i think i could curb the habit. but at the same time, it would be pretty isolating"
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"The idea of isolation adds another layer to quitting, but reshaping social time to support your health could feel rewarding."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,yea i guess
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Avoiding friends who smoke could feel isolating, but your health goals seem to offer more motivation and potential benefits for quitting."
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,client,thats true
663025c8522376734fa5a4f1,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. We've reached the end of our session, so I'll summarize what we've covered.  

We explored the idea of quitting smoking because of the financial strain it places on you and the growing health impacts you're experiencing, such as shortness of breath. You mentioned managing withdrawal by utilizing techniques like deep breathing and distracting yourself, which have been effective for you in the past. We've also touched on the challenge of social situations, particularly when you're with friends who smoke, and considered the potential isolation that could come from choosing not to be around them right now.

5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. To get started, could you share a bit about your experiences with smoking and what brings you here to discuss it?"
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,"I began smoking 10 years ago. It first started as a social thing, and I did not feel like I needed them and did not touch them for a fair amount of time. However, now I feel like I need to have them."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"In the beginning, smoking was just for social reasons, yet now it feels like a necessity. But I also hear some concern in your thoughts about this current need."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,"Yes, especially at this exact moment in my life. This year has been the worst year of my life, and I have craved cigarettes badly."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"This year has really challenged you, amplifying your cravings, yet it's clear you're also aware of how smoking has become more of a dependency than you'd like."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,"Yes, especially at this exact moment in my life. This year has been the worst year of my life, and I have craved cigarettes badly."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,What do you think it is about this year in particular that's made you feel like you need to smoke more?
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,Yes I have craved cigarettes more than ever this year. I believe it is due to stress.
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"While stress has been a significant challenge for you this year, creating an even stronger desire to smoke, it also indicates a part of you is seeking relief and peace."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,"It does, but I would like to stop smoking. It does not benefit me at all, and I am noticing changes in my health."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"While the stress of this year has intensified your urge to smoke, you're becoming more mindful of the negative impacts on your health and that's fueling your desire to quit. What's been capturing your attention about these changes in your health?"
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,"I am out of breath a lot more, and my front teeth are starting to turn yellowish-brown. I am also trying to lose weight and it is much harder when I feel like 10 steps take my breath away."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"What are some reasons that are most important to you for wanting to quit smoking, particularly as you're noticing these changes with your breath and your teeth?"
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,"I want to improve my health overall. I also want to live the longest and healthiest life that I can. Health complications run rampant on both sides of my family, so I am more prone to having issues."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"Even though stress makes you reach for cigarettes to cope, you're really focused on achieving better health and a long, full life, especially knowing the family health risks."
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,client,"I am focused on it, but I have to really make myself quit. I have gone cold turkey before and was able to stop for 3 years. What can I do to replace them, especially while stressed?"
5fcc103fb2ab80a01f32f7ae,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences today. I appreciate your openness and time. As we wrap up our session, let's take a moment to reflect on what we've discussed. 

You've expressed that, while stress has been a significant factor this past year, smoking began socially but evolved into something you feel you need now. We talked about how this reliance conflicts with your keen desire for better health, given your family's medical history and the changes you're noticing, like breathlessness and your teeth's condition.

You've also shared that you're determined to improve your overall well-being, aiming for a longer and healthier life. Your past success in quitting cigarettes cold turkey for three years highlights your capability and strength. You're considering finding alternatives to manage stress, which could be an important step as you think more about quitting.

64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'd love to hear a little about your experiences with smoking. How are you feeling about it at the moment?
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,I've just started a new job so I'm not really in the right frame of mind to stop smoking at the moment. I would like to maybe try again once ive settled into my new job.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"You have a lot on your plate with the new job, and smoking might feel like something you can lean on right now, but there's a part of you that's thinking about giving it another try once you're more settled."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,correct.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"Balancing a new job with changes in your life can be overwhelming, and while smoking might seem like a way to cope right now, you're also contemplating a future where you feel more settled and ready to take on quitting."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,"Yes, Everything is very up in the air at the moment. I know I wont have the strength to stop at the moment. Once I'm settled in my new job and routine I will have another go at it."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"Tell me, what do you think life might look like when you're more settled and feel ready to take on quitting smoking?"
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,"I'll be working my part time job, saving up money for my business. Learning new stuff, having a work social life. Life will be alright."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"You're picturing a stable future, pursuing your business dreams, connecting with new people, while taking another shot at quitting smoking on the horizon."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,yes.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"While the new job feels like it's keeping you from quitting right now, your vision for a balanced life with more learning and social connections highlights a desire to eventually move beyond smoking toward bigger goals."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,yes.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,What have you noticed about how smoking fits into your life during this time of transition with your new job?
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,"Smoking is a very common habit in the hospitality industry. I am a chef, therefore it wont be easy. I can say however that i've already cut down on the amount I smoke."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"Smoking may feel like an integral part of your life as a chef, but having already cut down on smoking shows your ability to change even amidst the industry's pressures."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,absolutley
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,Your ability to cut down on smoking while navigating the challenges of the hospitality industry really speaks to your determination and strength. What do you think has helped you successfully cut down on smoking so far?
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,I think being occupied with other things. Smoking isnt cheap either so I try to limit the amount i'm smoking. I have also started using a vape.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"Smoking is a common habit in your field and provides a way to stay grounded amidst the chaos, yet you're intentionally cutting back, investing in vaping, and tackling financial priorities."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,absolutely. I have a plan going forward so thats keeping me really motivated.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"...so having a plan and keeping busy are key elements keeping you focused on reducing smoking right now, even while adjusting to your new job."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,Yes. As a chef and business owner I dont have the time nor money to be smoking all the time. Therefore reducing the amount I smoke has been going great for me.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"What do you envision as the next step in your plan for finding balance between work, your business goals, and cutting down on smoking?"
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,"Get settled in my Job, Regularly save for my business capital and invest in a slightly better vape."
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,Tell me more about how investing in a better vape fits into your plan and how it might support your goal of cutting down on smoking.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,client,The vape I have at the moment is okay but it runs out of battery very quickly. This could be a factor that leads me back to smoking.
64403633e042e91beabe9645,counsellor,"Thank you for your time today. We've had a great conversation, and before we wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to recap what we've discussed.

Smoking feels like a familiar part of that world, but you're already taking steps to cut down.

6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm really interested in understanding your experience with smoking. Could you share with me what role smoking plays in your life right now?
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,"It helps me wind down, however, it is an addiction at this point."
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,"Smoking helps you relax and is a familiar comfort, yet you find yourself recognizing it as an addiction that's taken hold of your life."
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,Yes exactly
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,"Smoking offers you a way to unwind, but its grip as an addiction is apparent, hinting at a desire for change."
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,Yes I doubt that I can quit if I wanted to
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,What do you think makes it feel difficult to imagine quitting smoking?
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,The thought of life without cigarettes would make it hard for me to relax.

6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,Yes especially at work
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,What is it about your work environment that makes smoking feel necessary for relaxation?
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,"It is fast paced and very stressful, I have many duties."
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,"And with all those responsibilities, it might feel like cigarettes are the only quick way to get a breather, yet there may be other ways to manage stress just as effectively."
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,Yes I'm just not sure that they would work as well.
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,"Life without cigarettes might seem impossible because smoking has been a reliable escape, yet you're curious if other strategies could offer similar relief."

6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,Would you be open to exploring some alternative ways to manage stress that we can discuss together?
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,Yes
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,"One option might be to consider some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness exercises, which can be practiced quickly, even during short breaks. Would you be interested in experimenting with one of these methods to see how it feels?"
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,Yes i would
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,Imagining trying deep breathing or mindfulness feels a bit uncertain because cigarettes have taken on the role of a tried-and-true friend for stress management at work.
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,TRUE
6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,counsellor,"It's really encouraging to see your willingness to explore new strategies for stress relief, despite the comfort you find in smoking.

6615a12e1e26787cd3c070ed,client,Yes thank you

6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Smoking offers a quick way to manage stress and give you relief for a moment, but perhaps you're considering other ways to cope with stress while taking care of yourself."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Perhaps.

When you think about other ways you might relieve stress, what possibilities come to mind for you?"

6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Listening to music is a wonderful coping strategy, and recognizing something enjoyable that helps you relax shows your creativity and willingness to consider different options for stress relief. That's a valuable strength you have. How does music help you when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed?"
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,"It calms me down, and helps me relax."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,And it offers you a space where you can step back and take a breath.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Absolutely.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,What thoughts do you have about how music and other activities might be part of managing stress differently in the future?
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,I guess I could try listening to music when I get stressed.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"You're open to experimenting with new ways to help guide your stress, and incorporating music into these moments might open up a calming pathway for you."

6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,I can try.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,...and perhaps become a more consistent part of your routine to create those moments of relaxation.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Hopefully.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,...which sets a foundation for trying new ways to handle stress that could be more aligned with the changes you want to make.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,That's true.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,You're thinking about how integrating music as a form of relaxation could be a valuable step in exploring new ways to manage stress and potentially easing into changes you might want to make.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,"Yeah, I'm considering it. I'm just not sure it will help."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"What other thoughts do you have about things that might help with stress, even if you're uncertain about how effective they could be?"
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Do you have any suggestions?
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,Would you be open to exploring some ideas about stress management together?
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Yes.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"We could talk about different approaches, like mindful breathing, gentle exercise, connecting socially in small ways, or even finding hobbies that energize you. Let me know if there are any that capture your interest or if you'd like to explore them further."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,I enjoy poetry.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,You might discover that expressing yourself through poetry could be another way to release stress and tap into your creativity.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,"Maybe, I like to smoke while I write."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Smoking while writing helps with your creativity and flow, but you're also thinking about how poetry itself could become a focus for managing stress."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Very true.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Writing while smoking has been a pattern that supports your creativity, yet you’re open to exploring the idea of using poetry and even other elements like music or mindfulness to manage stress in a different way."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Okay.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,You might find that weaving poetry with moments of music or even small pauses for reflection could enhance your writing experience without always needing a cigarette.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,That would be nice.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,What ideas do you have for beginning to develop your poetry and relaxation moments without relying on smoking?
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Maybe write inside so I can't smoke.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Choosing to write inside might create an environment focused more on the art of poetry itself, offering a fresh perspective on your process."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,True.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,What other steps are you considering to support writing and relaxation without smoking?

6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,Not focusing on wanting to smoke can be a challenge because it's such a familiar habit and yet shifting that focus onto writing and relaxing could lead to discovering new depths in your creativity and inner peace.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,Good point.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Your openness to exploring these new ideas shows your willingness to grow and adapt, and that's a powerful step in itself. What are your thoughts about how you might gradually integrate these changes into your writing process?"
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,I'm willing to try.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Choosing to try is a significant commitment to yourself, allowing you to explore new pathways even if you're unsure of the outcome."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,I'm definitely unsure of the outcome.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"You're feeling uncertain about the outcome of trying these new approaches, yet you're open to giving it a chance and seeing where it leads you."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,"Yes, I am."
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,What do you find most exciting or intriguing about the idea of trying these new approaches to writing and stress management?

6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,I don't really think there is much more to discuss.
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,counsellor,"Thanks for the conversation today. I'll summarize our discussion so far. We've explored your concerns about smoking and how it's been feeling like too much in your life. You're working with a lot, including the responsibilities of being a stay-at-home mom, managing agoraphobia, and the journey of being diagnosed with autism. In this context, smoking has served as a stress reliever for you, yet you're beginning to consider alternatives like music and poetry for relaxation. You've expressed interest in using writing as a means to potentially shift your focus away from smoking, perhaps through writing indoors or focusing more on the creative process itself. Your willingness to try new ways to handle stress and the openness to considering a life without smoking highlights your bravery and resilience. If there's anything more you wish to explore in future conversations, I'll be here to support you on your journey. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts and being open today.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
6722ae0741429fa41d8893db,client,No
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm curious to hear about your experience with smoking. Could you share a bit about what role smoking plays in your life right now?
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,I mostly smoked when I feel stressed in other to unwind and ease off.
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,What kinds of situations or feelings lead to stress for you?
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,Situations when I feel anxious especially when I feel I have no control over it.
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,Tell me more about how smoking helps you manage that feeling of having no control.
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,It helps me feel something else. The chemicals distract me from the feeling of helplessness and bring some ease to my emotions
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,"Like a release valve, it relieves the pressure of those emotions, giving you a momentary sense of ease."
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,Yes exactly. That hit the point to the T
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,"It takes a lot of insight to recognize how your feelings influence your smoking habits, and that self-awareness is a big strength. What are some other things in your life that help you cope with stress or give you a sense of control?"
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,Meditation has been helpful. Also Cardio has helped as well.
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,"How do meditation and cardio help you find relief from stress, and how do they compare to smoking for you?"
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,Cardio gives me a certain kind of high just like smoking. Meditation is just relaxing into the present moment which relieves stress and anxiety.
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,What's your experience been like when you turn to cardio and meditation instead of smoking?
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,It's been a good experience but I have struggled with consistency in these habits as lighting as cigarette is just way easier to do.
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,"Even though smoking feels easier, you've found that cardio and meditation offer a more lasting and meaningful escape from stress when you can stick to them."
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,That's right. They are more healthy ways
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,How do you envision finding a balance between what's easy and what's healthy for you in managing stress?
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,please elaborate more on that
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,Would it be alright if we talk about ways to make those healthier habits more accessible for you?
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,Yes it would be as that is what I struggle with
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,Finding small and realistic ways to integrate cardio and meditation into your daily routine could make those habits a bit less daunting and more consistent over time.
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,Okay that could work but I feel like I don't have time to do that everyday compared to lighting up when I am anywhere
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,"Finding time each day feels challenging, yet you have experienced the benefits of cardio and meditation, which might motivate you to seek ways to incorporate them into your routine."
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,client,That's a good point
65a9239a58dbce6f4fa1d6af,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to share with me today. We've talked about how smoking helps you manage feelings of stress and lack of control, offering a momentary escape and ease.

63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,smoking is a habit. If I feel stressed I smoke a cigarette to relieve the stress

63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,"when i light a cigarette and take a drag i feel the stress melt away. before i light up everything is a little more annoying than normal to me, but after smoking i feel like i can handle life better"
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,counsellor,"Smoking helps you manage your stress and makes things feel more bearable, yet I wonder if there's a part of you that's also considered handling stress in other ways."
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,i consider it but my stress levels go up quickly and i feel overwhelmed
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,counsellor,"Handling stress in other ways feels like climbing a steep hill, especially when everything comes at you all at once, yet you might be curious about how it would feel to find a path that doesn't lead to a cigarette."

63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,i like that it is distracting. there are many things to hear and see while walking. it usually lowers my stress
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,counsellor,"...and while walking, you find a little bit of peace in the distraction, granting you a moment to breathe and let go."
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,yes true

63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,my mind focuses on cleaning so i don't think of the stress as much
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,counsellor,"And as you clean, you're able to put your mind in a calmer place, just like walking, where the stress takes a backseat."
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,yes
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,counsellor,"How would it feel for you if those strategies, walking and cleaning, replaced smoking more often as a way to handle stress?"

63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,counsellor,"What do you think about exploring these other strategies, like walking and cleaning, to manage stress instead of reaching for a cigarette?"
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,yes i can try. it is hard to go for walks in the bad weather though
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,counsellor,What do you think you might do on days when the weather isn't ideal for a walk?
63d141f0a7b0e7ea9526e89d,client,i don't know maybe play music and have a dance party with my kids

Yet, you've also explored other ways, like walking, cleaning, and having fun with your kids, to manage stress and bring joy into your life. You've expressed a desire to cut down on smoking slowly, perhaps by taking longer breaks between cigarettes and buying fewer to begin with.

6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,counsellor,"Smoking has been something you've enjoyed, yet you recognize that prioritizing your health as you age is becoming more important."
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,client,Yes. I'd like to save the money too.
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,counsellor,What are the most important health and financial changes you're hoping to see if you decide to quit smoking?
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,client,I expect my skin and teeth to improve and to save more money to spend travelling.

6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,client,The weather can change my motivation to quit. I smoke less when it rains.
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,counsellor,"Though the habit persists on sunny days, rainy weather often reduces your desire to smoke, indicating there's room for change when conditions align."
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,client,Yes. It rains a lot here.
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,counsellor,"Rainy days may make it easier for you to smoke less, yet consistency in quitting remains a challenge, so smoking cessation may help since the rain can be quite frequent."

6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,client,Pretty much.
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,counsellor,"Cutting down shows your struggle with letting go, yet you also recognize the potential to fully quit and achieve the vibrant life you envision through stronger lungs and added energy for the activities you love."

6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,counsellor,"Decreasing by just a cigarette or two each day feels like a small step, and this steady dedication could be the discipline you need to gradually reach your goal of quitting altogether."
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,client,I will try.
6062450c1bb2c6f42298bda8,counsellor,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. As we wrap up our conversation, let's reflect on what we’ve discussed. You've shared that although you enjoy smoking, health concerns and financial considerations are becoming more motivating as you think about quitting.

You've already taken steps by trying to cut down, recognizing discipline as a helpful tool to decrease your consumption by one or two cigarettes a day.

665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"Thank you for agreeing to have this conversation with me. To start, could you share a bit about what your experience has been like with smoking?"
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,"I started smoking when I was 15, mainly because a lot of my friends were doing it. I carried on throughout university and I have never been able to give up since then."
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"Smoking has been a part of your life for quite some time, starting back in your teenage years because of the influence of friends."

665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,What role does smoking play in your life these days?
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,"I enjoy the thought of smoking much more than the activity these days. I will look forward to a cigarette and experience cravings, however, I often do not enjoy the cigarette and regret it afterwards."
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"Even though you find yourself looking forward to smoking due to cravings, you're noticing those moments often leave you with regret because the satisfaction isn't there anymore."
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,yes
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"You've got this ongoing routine of reaching for a cigarette when cravings hit, but it's losing its appeal, and you seem to be considering the idea of what life might be like if this unfulfilling pattern wasn't part of it."
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,yes
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,What are some of the thoughts or feelings you experience when you think about possibly letting go of smoking?
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,I experience happiness for the first day or two of trying to quit but I can never seem to get any further as my body starts to crave the nictone. This leads to me being easily frustrated and generally
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"Your first efforts to quit bring you happiness at the start, but the difficulty in managing cravings seems to be a hurdle; there's a glimpse of hope you're exploring, like imagining yourself beyond the first few days."

665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"Your determination in attempting to quit and the happiness you feel at first are commendable. It shows a strong desire for change, even with the challenges that follow. What do you think helps you keep going through those first couple of days when you're not smoking?"
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,the cravings are not as bad for the first few days. it is also easier to remember the reasons why I am trying to quit as they are fresher in the memory.
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"The craving intensity ramps up after a few days, making it harder to hold onto your reasons for quitting, yet that initial relief when the cravings are less makes quitting seem like a real possibility."
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,yes
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"You feel a strong pull from the nicotine cravings that build over time, making it tough to stay focused on your reasons for quitting, yet the initial relief keeps the possibility of change within your reach."
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,yes
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,Tell me more about the reasons that motivate you to quit smoking and how they impact your life.
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,I have recently noticed that I am more frequently tired and sometimes out of breath when performing normal household duties. This has forced me to think about the more serious dangers of smoking.
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,...and these physical reminders are creating a stronger awareness of the need to safeguard your health.
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,yes
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,Recognizing these health concerns pushes you to think seriously about the long-term impact on your well-being.
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,yes
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"Your awareness of these changes in how you feel shows a real dedication to valuing your health and taking steps toward it, even when it's difficult. How do you see your life being different if those health concerns were no longer an issue?"
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,client,I used to really value my health and I would go to the gym 5 or 6 days a week. I believe if I wasn't smoking and had more energy that I would get back into this.
665e406a0f22e57ff8be5cde,counsellor,"Being free from smoking could reignite your passion for fitness, bringing back the energy and routine that made you feel healthier and more fulfilled."

You've shared that smoking began in your teenage years and continued into adulthood, becoming a routine part of your life. Despite the cravings, you sometimes find yourself not enjoying smoking as much anymore and even feeling regret after smoking. We talked about how your recent experiences with tiredness and shortness of breath have made you more conscious of the health implications, which adds motivation for wanting to quit.

We also explored how the start of quitting brings you happiness, despite the challenges that come with cravings. Looking to the future, you envision a life where quitting smoking could reignite your passion for going to the gym and bring positive changes in other areas of your life, like focus at work and attention to your partner. 

Lastly, you noted the difficulty in breaking the routine of smoking. We considered ideas for replacing this routine with healthier habits, such as using toothpicks or heading to the gym after work.

Thank you again for talking with me today. If there's anything else you need or want to discuss in the future, feel free to reach out. Take care!"

5de90f54a48441037ac21f43,client,I'm going to look into possible options near me tonight. I would give anything to be a non smoker and be absolutely repelled by the idea of picking it back up.
5de90f54a48441037ac21f43,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your time and thoughts with me today. As we wrap up, let's take a moment to reflect on what we've discussed.

5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,counsellor,"You might find it helpful to practice this breathing exercise for about 5 minutes at a time, choosing a few moments throughout the day or whenever you feel anxious. Would that be something you'd be willing to try?"
5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,client,yes for sure
5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,counsellor,"What other activities or methods, aside from breathing exercises, are you curious about trying in order to manage anxiety and reduce smoking?"

5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,client,can you advise any in particular to do?
5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,counsellor,"Exploring these methods can be a personal journey as different approaches work for different people; I suggest considering what feels most approachable and engaging for you right now, possibly beginning with something you're already interested in, like meditation."

5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,counsellor,"Vaping might provide the nicotine without the tar, but you're still weighing how it fits into your journey towards better health."

5987030cfd8cca00015cbc26,counsellor,"Vaping is generally considered to expose you to fewer harmful chemicals than smoking, as it doesn't involve burning tobacco.

661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm curious about how smoking fits into your life right now. Would you mind sharing a bit about that with me?
661433352944c111887337c4,client,I started smoking 18 years ago as a teenager. I'm not sure why I continued to smoke considering it tasted horrible and made me choke when I first tried it. I find I smoke the most when I'm stressed
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,Continuing to smoke even though it didn't start off enjoyable because it became a way to manage stress over the years.
661433352944c111887337c4,client,yes that is correct
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,What are some things you notice about yourself or your situation when you feel most stressed and reach for a cigarette?
661433352944c111887337c4,client,I notice I start to feel overwhelmed and can't calm myself down so instead I reach for a cigarette
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,Tell me more about what it’s like for you in those overwhelming moments when you decide to smoke.
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"In those moments, I feel like I have no control over anything in my life. I feel like I have a huge to-do list and can't get anything done."
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,It might feel like smoking is the one thing you can control when everything else feels chaotic.
661433352944c111887337c4,client,I never thought of it that way but I think you could be right
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,"Like trying to juggle too many balls at once, and smoking feels like the net that catches everything."
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"yes, exactly. It calms me down and helps me not feel so overwhelmed anymore"
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,Smoking offers you a momentary break to ease the stress of those overwhelming feelings.
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"Yes, I want to quit, especially because I want to have children, but it seems so hard to quit when I'm in those stressful situations."
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,"In thinking about having children and also wanting to quit, what stands out to you as most important right now?"
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"Most important to me is having a family with my husband. I refuse to be those women that smoke while pregnant. I also have asthma and know that if I quit, quitting will improve my asthma."
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,"Prioritizing your health and the dream of starting a family shows your strong commitment to creating a positive future, even amidst the challenge of quitting smoking in stressful times."
661433352944c111887337c4,client,I just feel like it's easier said than done.
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,"Quitting feels daunting and it's not easy to imagine letting go, but the hope of a healthy family and better asthma control seems to energize your desire to stop smoking."
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"Yes, they do. I'm afraid though because I have tried quitting in the past more than once and I failed."
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,What were some of the things you learned from those past attempts to quit?
661433352944c111887337c4,client,I learned that I need to find healthier ways to manage my stress. I also learned that everyone has a different way of doing things. My journey of quitting is not the same as the next person's.
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,"Your experiences have taught you that creating your own path to manage stress is essential, and you're considering ways that align with your unique needs."
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"yes, that's exactly it."

661433352944c111887337c4,client,"I appreciate the words of encouragement. I do feel like I can quit, I just don't know if I'm ready to. I also believe though that no one is ever really ready to quit and you just have to do it."
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,What would starting your journey to quit smoking look like for you when you think about it?
661433352944c111887337c4,client,It would look like being more mindful about what I put into my body. I want to eat healthier and exercise more as well. I think doing those will help give me stress relief and the confidence to quit.
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,You're creating a holistic approach to change by considering how mindful choices in diet and exercise can empower you to overcome stress and build the confidence to quit smoking.
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"Yea, I really want to get myself back on track as a whole. I want to be mentally, physically, and emotionally healthy."
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,"Tell me more about the mental, physical, and emotional health you envision for yourself and how that might influence your smoking habits."
661433352944c111887337c4,client,"I'm overweight now, so that makes me self-conscious. I would like to get myself to a healthier weight and fully love myself. I think that would improve my mental very much."
661433352944c111887337c4,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today.

However, you're now seeing it's not just about quitting smoking but about the bigger picture of wellness — mentally, physically, and emotionally. 

You've identified managing stress as crucial, along with envisioning a healthy lifestyle that includes mindful eating and exercise. These steps seem vital to nurturing your self-confidence and health, especially with your hopes of starting a family and improving your asthma.

5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,client,"they romanticised it and made it seem like such a therapeutic process. Also, I was always alone when they went to smoke so I wanted to fit in"
5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,counsellor,"Fitting in with your friends by joining them for a smoke feels important, but you're also questioning if it's truly as therapeutic and romantic as it was made out to be."

5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,counsellor,"Wanting to fit in with your friends while seeking something comforting and therapeutic, though now you're wondering what it would actually be like if your breaks didn't revolve around smoking."

5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,client,routine
5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,counsellor,"Having a routine with smoking keeps things familiar, and sometimes breaking away from that can feel daunting."
5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,client,"not daunting, it just feels like a massive abrupt change"
5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,counsellor,"Changing something that feels like a solid part of your routine seems unsettling, and yet there's a part of you that's exploring what life might be like if smoking were no longer part of that routine."

5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,client,no
5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far. You have been smoking for ten years, and it's become a comforting routine and a way to take breaks from life's demands. Initially, peer pressure and a desire to fit in played a role in starting this habit, but now you're recognizing its financial impact, and that's been weighing on you. The thought of saving money by quitting smoking is appealing, yet there's a concern about replacing one addiction with another. You're considering the value of support, like joining a group where you can connect with others on a similar journey. You're open to exploring these possibilities, and that's a big step toward change. If you're ready, we can continue exploring this path together when you're ready.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
5eea256b9e506b0d09822cdc,client,No
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I appreciate the opportunity to chat with you. To start things off, could you share with me a little bit about your relationship with smoking?"
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,I've been smoking since I was a teenager.  I am now 52.  I successfully quit smoking 6 times.  5 of those times were when i became pregnant and I did not smoke for the duration of my pregancies
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"You've managed to successfully quit smoking multiple times, which shows a lot of strength and commitment during your pregnancies, although maintaining it outside of those times has been challenging."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,Yes.  I also quit an additional time.  It started as a bet and i did not smoke for five years.  That was my longest period of not smoking.
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,Quitting for five years shows you have the ability to see through a challenge once you're motivated.
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,I agree
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,You've shown incredible resilience and determination both during your pregnancies and in achieving a five-year period without smoking. Those successes highlight your capacity for commitment and making meaningful changes when you choose to. I'm curious to know what led you back to smoking after those significant periods of quitting. What do you think contributed to you starting again?
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,I use smoking as a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety.  So I think that I when i experience periods of stress and anxiety I fall back into the habit
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"Smoking provides temporary relief during stressful times, yet you've demonstrated that you can quit and manage without it when you find motivation."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,I agree
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,Finding alternative ways to manage stress could open up a path to quitting smoking for good.
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,What ways do you recommend>
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,Finding what works best for you might take some exploration. Would you like to brainstorm a few options together?
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,yes
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,You might consider practices like deep breathing or stepping outside for fresh air whenever you feel the urge to smoke.
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,ok.  what else
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"Stress has been a storm, and smoking the umbrella you reach for, though you have weathered storms before without it."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,ok
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"When you're ready, experimenting with new activities that interest you may help, and you might discover something that offers comfort like smoking currently does."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,Provide some examples
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,What activities or hobbies have interested you in the past that you might explore further now?
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,Hmmm I'm not sure
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,What activities or experiences have brought you joy or relaxation in the past?
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,walking/hiking
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"Walking and hiking bring clarity and peace, serving as a path toward freedom from smoking."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,Another issue i face is that i use smoking as a reward for getting things done.  For example i have a cig after working on something or after doing a chore.
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"Smoking acts as a reward for your hard work, yet engaging in activities like hiking could also bring a sense of accomplishment and relaxation."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,Perhaps
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,What thoughts or feelings would emerge if you chose alternative rewards instead of smoking?
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,I'm still worried about the hand to mouth fixation and about gaining weight
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"You're concerned about gaining weight and missing the hand-to-mouth action of smoking, yet exploring new rewards or activities offers a healthier way to cope and find comfort."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,I guess
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"You're apprehensive about the weight gain and missing that hand-to-mouth action, but there's potential in tapping into healthier habits like walking as both a reward and a coping strategy for stress."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,so what would you consider best practices for someone like me who was considering stopping smoking
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"When you're ready and if you'd like, we could explore together how others facing similar challenges have managed to navigate quitting."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,ok i'm ready
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"People sometimes find success by setting small, achievable goals, like decreasing the number of cigarettes gradually, and replacing smoking with positive activities such as walking. Would you be open to setting a small goal like this?"

66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"Your commitment to setting a small goal of reducing cigarettes indicates a readiness to explore quitting, using walking or other rewarding activities as stepping stones on this journey."
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,client,"Given the current amount of cigs i smoke a day which is around 12, what should be my first reduction goal?"
66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,Starting by reducing one cigarette per day and observing how you feel might be a manageable first step. Would that be a goal you're comfortable trying?

66ba790e8c9b2e8e70ef8bcf,counsellor,"Thank you for spending your time with me today. To wrap up our conversation, let's recap what we've discussed. You've shared that smoking has played a significant role in managing stress and as a reward system in your life, but you've also successfully quit smoking in the past during your pregnancies and for a notable five-year period. Your decision to try reducing one cigarette a day, starting with your last evening cigarette, demonstrates readiness to explore change. We talked about how walking and hiking, which you enjoy, could serve as helpful coping mechanisms and potential rewards. Your openness and thoughts about healthier habits signal a willingness to create a positive change. I appreciate your willingness to engage with these ideas.

616ce6d278653bde15418661,client,It is obviously very bad for me but at the moment the positives out weigh the risks.
616ce6d278653bde15418661,counsellor,"Smoking has some immediate benefits for you, like providing a break and some solitude, but at the same time, you're aware of the risks to your health that come with it."

616ce6d278653bde15418661,counsellor,"The benefits of smoking, like taking a break and enjoying the moment, make it hard to give up, but at the same time, you have worries about the health risks that come with it."

616ce6d278653bde15418661,counsellor,Could we brainstorm some activities that you might enjoy during your breaks as much as smoking?
616ce6d278653bde15418661,client,vaping
616ce6d278653bde15418661,counsellor,"Vaping offers a potentially less harmful way to capture some of the benefits you seek during your breaks, but you're still considering the overall impact on your health goals."

616ce6d278653bde15418661,counsellor,What would life look like for you if you could enjoy those breaks without any concerns about health?

616ce6d278653bde15418661,client,i'm not sure it will. I am just told it is better to live a long healthy life
616ce6d278653bde15418661,counsellor,"There might be a belief that longevity and good health are just ideals set by others, which leaves room for discovering what long-term well-being could truly mean for you personally."
616ce6d278653bde15418661,client,this makes me need a smoke are we almost done
616ce6d278653bde15418661,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me today.

5e07aa9cb638531138f72587,counsellor,"Since seeing a doctor isn't an option right now, we might explore other resources together, like community support groups or online forums, where you can connect with others who are on a similar journey, gaining insights and encouragement."

61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,Thank you for joining me today. I'd like to know more about your experience with smoking. Could you share with me what smoking means to you?
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,Smoking is my stress relief from daily life
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"Smoking provides you a momentary escape from the pressures of life, but part of you might wish for other ways to manage stress."
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,Yes I do
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"Smoking serves as a way to manage stress, yet there's a desire within you to discover other methods too."
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,Yes I have looked into vaping as an alternative
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,Tell me about your thoughts and feelings around vaping as an alternative.
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,I feel it will be better for my body while being able to control my cravings for nicotine.
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"It sounds like vaping might offer a healthier solution for your body, though addressing the root causes of cravings could create even more balance in your life."
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,Yes that's true
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"Vaping could be a better option for reducing harm while still addressing your nicotine cravings, though there's a determination to manage these cravings more effectively in the long run."
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,How do I find the root causes and how can I fix it
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,Would it be alright if we explore together some of the underlying causes of your cravings and discuss ways to address them?
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,yes please
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"Let's start by identifying situations in your life that lead to cravings, and then together, we can brainstorm some methods to address those."
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,ok
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,What are some situations or feelings in your life that make you reach for a cigarette or want to vape?
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,yes
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,In what types of situations or emotions do you find yourself wanting to smoke the most?
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,being bored or stressed or angry
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"You're caught in an emotional loop where boredom, stress, or anger drive you towards smoking, but finding new ways to manage these emotions could open up healthier paths for you."
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,such as
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"You're learning to figure out how you cope with stress, anger, or boredom and you're already taking steps—like thinking about vaping—to change your reactions and habits. You have the power to continue exploring different ways to find comfort or grounding in these moments. What are some ways you might explore handling boredom, stress, or anger differently from smoking or vaping?"
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,I'm not too sure I worry about the nicotine
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,...and how to lessen its grip while seeking out new ways to fill those moments with healthier actions.
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,Is nicotine gum a good path to take?
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"Choosing nicotine gum is one possibility that could help manage cravings, and it might give you some freedom to explore other stress-relief methods. Would you like to discuss the potential benefits or challenges that might come with it?"
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,yes
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"Nicotine gum is designed to help reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings by providing a controlled amount of nicotine, without the harmful effects of smoking.

61435b26170aa14747574253,client,ok will be worth trying then. Thank you for your help.
61435b26170aa14747574253,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's go over what we talked about: We explored how smoking serves as a way for you to deal with stress, boredom, and anger, while developing a longing to find healthier alternatives.

While weighing nicotine gum as a potential tool, you showed a strong determination to explore other stress-relief methods.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
61435b26170aa14747574253,client,No
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,Thank you for agreeing to chat with me today. Can you tell me a bit about your experience with smoking and what it's like for you right now?
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I have been smoking for 40 years.  I am currently thinking about quitting but really haven't found the motivation or desire too.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"You've been smoking for a long time and haven't felt a strong push to quit, yet you're starting to think about quitting."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"Correct.  I have quit in the past, longest period of time was 2 years."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,...and you know there's potential for change because you've succeeded in the past.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I know there is a potential if I ever really decide that I want to quit
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,Describe for me what you're thinking or feeling when you consider the idea of quitting smoking.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"I'm not sure.  I'm getting older now so probably should quit for health reasons and cigarettes are so expensive now.  I don't think I really ""feel"" anything about it when I think about it."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"You don't really feel an emotional pull about quitting, but the cost and health factors are making you think it might be time to consider it more seriously."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,Yes.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"Smoking has been largely habitual, and you don't feel a strong emotional urge to quit right now, but you recognize the push from health concerns and rising costs."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,Correct again.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"You show a lot of self-awareness by recognizing these aspects of smoking’s impact on your life. That kind of insight can be a valuable strength in considering future changes. When you think about the times you’ve thought of quitting, what kind of changes do you imagine might come with that decision?"
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I really think the only change will be beating the habit/addiction.  Nothing about my life will really change besides the act of smoking.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"The habit feels like a significant part of your routine, but breaking free from it could bring a sense of accomplishment and relief over beating the addiction."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I don't know about accomplishment and relief.  The habit is the thing.  I can't really think of what smoking brings to my life.  Besides lots of outside time.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"Smoking is a regular part of your day and doesn't seem to add much to your life, yet embracing the outdoors during those times is something you value."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I love being outside.  I will go outside whether I smoke or not.  Just finding a positive.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"What difference do you imagine it would make if you decided to stop smoking, aside from finding freedom from the habit?"
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I will have more money in my pocket
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"Describe some activities or experiences outdoor that you enjoy, aside from smoking."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"Kayaking, hiking, working in the yard"
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,Finding joy and fulfillment in being outdoors makes you realize you have other ways to connect with nature beyond smoking.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I don't feel like smoking makes me connected to nature
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"Enjoying outdoor activities such as kayaking, hiking, and yard work really connects you to the world outside, offering a powerful reason to continue spending time outdoors whether or not smoking is involved."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,That is more accurate.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"Share with me some of your thoughts or feelings about what life might look like without smoking, both the good and the challenging aspects."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I do not really have thoughts on it.  The only thought I can think of is the money aspect.  I guess my health would be better for it too.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"There might not be a strong pull of specific imagery when you think about quitting, but the idea of improved health and having more money could offer some motivation."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,I don't know what imagery I could imagine.  Smoking is a stress release and I don't even think that factors more than the habit of it.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"You find some release from stress with smoking, but recognizing ways to boost your health and saving more money could be a compelling draw toward change."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"yes, that's right"
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"How do you see stress playing a role in your life, and are there other ways you think you might manage stress, aside from smoking?"
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"Stress is a big factor in my life for so many different reasons.  I don't know another way to manage it.  It's overwhelming at times, the stress."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,Describe some of the stressors you're facing and how they affect your daily life.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,My job - I hate it.  My kid has a complicated medical condition and neurodevelopmental issues.  My family works really hard to get on my nerves. Money is tight.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,Could you help me understand more about the ways these stressors affect you and how smoking fits into coping with them?
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"Normally, I handle stress just fine.  Right now, I feel completely overwhelmed with it.  I'm just sad and tired.  I took today off work for a mental health day. How does smoking fit?  I don't know."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"You're feeling completely overwhelmed by the weight of these stressors, and smoking hasn't really been a clear way of managing that stress, so taking a mental health day shows your efforts in seeking relief."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"Correct. I don't think smoking takes away the stress and because of the financial aspect, probably adds to it."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,...and the stress from the financial burden of smoking just adds another layer to everything you're already dealing with.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,Correct.
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"Describe your feelings around the idea of letting go of the smoking habit, even just as a thought experiment, and what barriers you think might arise in giving it up."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,client,"My feelings are that smoking is the only thing I do for me.  I don't enjoy my job so that doesn't give pleasure, with a medically complex kid, there is always something."
665641be681ea694fe7da6b0,counsellor,"Thank you for your time today. We've reached the end of our conversation, so let’s summarize what we’ve discussed so far. 

You've been considering quitting smoking, but find motivation hard to pin down despite knowing the potential health benefits and financial relief from giving up the habit. We've talked about how you successfully quit in the past, which shows you have the strength and capacity for change. Smoking seems like a routine without much emotional attachment, but it adds stress due to financial strain. You also appreciate spending time outdoors, engaging in activities like kayaking, hiking, and yard work, regardless of smoking.

You've expressed feeling overwhelmed by stress from work, family, and financial pressures. Taking a mental health day reflects your awareness of needing relief and shows how you're trying to manage things.

Seeing smoking as a small thing you do for yourself, amidst all the challenges, is important to note. Recognizing these patterns and feelings could be significant steps in understanding the part smoking plays in your life.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to continue exploring these thoughts or make any decisions down the road. Thank you for sharing with me today, and take care."
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,Thank you for agreeing to chat with me today. I'd love to hear about what role smoking plays in your life right now.
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,It makes me feel calm
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,What are some other ways smoking affects your day-to-day life?
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,It delays my daily routine
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"Smoking helps you feel calm, yet it interferes with your routines. It seems that balancing these aspects is complicated for you."
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,Yes very complicated
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"Smoking delays your routine, which makes things more complicated, but you're wondering if there's a way to stay calm without those disruptions."
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,Yes
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,Tell me more about what it means for you to have calmness in your life and how smoking fits into that picture.
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,"Calmness reflects a state of emotional balance, stress management, and a sense of inner peace. For me, smoking is tied to this concept, as it can serve as a ritual or perceived cop"
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"What are some ways you've managed to find calmness without smoking in the past, if any?"
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,Finding calmness without smoking can often involve me practicing nurturing the mind and body. Some strategies might include engaging in physical activities like walking
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"How do you feel after engaging in physical activities like walking, and how does it compare to the calmness you experience from smoking?"
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,"Engaging in physical activities like walking often brings a sense of relaxation and mental clarity, helping to reduce stress and improve my mood."
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,Engaging in activities like walking not only provides the relaxation you're seeking but also boosts your confidence knowing you can find calmness within yourself.
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,yes
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"Walking provides you with mental clarity and relaxation, which shows you can cultivate a calm, stress-free state without relying on a cigarette, adding depth to your ability to manage stress in a healthier way."
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,Yes
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,It's great that you recognize the value of physical activity in finding calmness and have taken steps to incorporate it into your life. That shows a lot of strength and self-awareness. What changes have you envisioned for yourself that align with the sense of calmness and relaxation you aim to achieve?
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,"That’s a wonderful reflection on your goals for calmness and relaxation. Envisioning changes such as adopting more consistent relaxation techniques, integrating mindfulness practices"
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,What steps have you thought about taking to deepen that sense of calmness and relaxation in your life?
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,"Setting aside time for activities that ground me, such as mindfulness meditation, journaling, or practicing gratitude"
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"You've been using smoking to ground yourself, but you're now aiming to incorporate mindfulness and things like journaling and gratitude to achieve a more lasting, peaceful state."
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,Yes
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"You're painting a picture of a life where you'll use mindfulness and relaxation techniques to find deeper peace, creating space to explore these grounding activities even more."
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,OK
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"What would adding more of these grounding activities, like mindfulness and journaling, look like for you?"
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,client,could involve dedicating a specific time each day to these practices.
66afc62b516f834cb56504f8,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. We've covered a lot during our conversation. We explored how smoking has served as a way to create calmness in your life but also how it complicates your daily routine. You mentioned engaging in physical activities like walking, which provides you with relaxation and mental clarity beyond what smoking provides. You've begun envisioning a life where mindfulness, journaling, and gratitude contribute to a lasting sense of peace. Looking ahead, you expressed an interest in dedicating specific times for these grounding practices to further enhance your calm and well-being. If there's anything further you'd like to explore, or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Thank you for taking the time to talk today."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. I'm curious about your relationship with smoking. Would you mind sharing a bit about how smoking fits into your life right now?
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Sure. I am a 54 year old male. I actually began smoking around 19 years old (cigarettes) and I was able to quit around the age of 35. From that point onwards, I only smoked a pipe very occasionally."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,You've had quite a journey with smoking over the years. I'd love to hear more about what led you to quit cigarettes and how smoking a pipe occasionally fits into your life.
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"I stopped smoking a pipe just last year because I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Since then I picked up a vape pen, and unfortunately I have been using my vape several times a day."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"You've moved away from smoking a pipe, which shows a commitment to your health, especially after your diagnosis, but you're finding that vaping has become a regular part of your life again."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Yes I never should have started it. But I find it doesn't affect my disease the way a pipe did. Also I've retired recently and I find myself bored at times, which makes me more likely to vape."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"And yet, despite it not affecting your disease, there's a part of you that feels it's not quite what you wanted after giving up the pipe."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Yes it was a stupid thing to do. It's not known if it's the nicotine or tar that worsens Crohn's, so a vape pen, even containing no tar, may still make the disease worse. I am upset with myself."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,Share more about what vaping does for you and how it fits into your daily routine.
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Yes it was a stupid thing to do. It's not known if it's the nicotine or tar that worsens Crohn's, so a vape pen, even containing no tar, may still make the disease worse. I am upset with myself."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"You have reasons for feeling upset with yourself because of the potential health risks, and you also have moments where you recognize vaping as something to address."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Yes it can't be good that I've started smoking again, especially at this age. I should know better. This is a time of life to start looking after health more closely, not throwing caution to the wind."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"Despite feeling like vaping was a step backward, deep down you're aware that this is an important time to prioritize your health and make choices that support your well-being."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Yes absolutely right. Now is the time to make a change. Luckily I only vape about 6 times a day, so I'm not a heavy smoker by any means. I used to smoke way more when I was younger and I quit then."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,Tell me more about what you imagine would be different if you were to cut back on vaping or quit entirely.
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Just that I need to replace it with something else. It's really out of boredom that I vape, I know that. If I fix that issue I feel like I would have no problem."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,What kinds of activities or interests have you thought about exploring to fill that sense of boredom?
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,I have gotten away from some hobbies that I would like to take up again. I play some musical instruments and I knit but haven't done either for some time. I also have new hobbies to take up.
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"You may feel a bit rusty, but there's an excitement about rekindling those musical and knitting interests because they could bring the fulfillment you're missing."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,Yes I agree. Just takes a little willpower to get started again.
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"Walking me through how you've overcome challenges in the past, how might you apply those experiences to bring these old and new hobbies back into your life?"
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"Well before when I was working, there was discipline involved. You have to be at work at a certain time, do things at a certain time. Now being retired, if I don't set a schedule, there's none."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"You miss the structure that work provided, but you're thinking that setting a personal schedule could bring back discipline so you can enjoy your hobbies again."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"yes exactly right. Create my own schedule and fill my day with activities, so that I even know what I'm doing tomorrow and the day after that."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,What do you think your day could look like with a new schedule focused on your interests and filling in those gaps?
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,client,"More rigid than now. Planned and coordinating, but leaving some free time here and there to make room for ad hoc activities like naps, etc."
6605cd2fc352ad987368723a,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to have this conversation with me. You've shared a lot about your journey with smoking, your diagnosis of Crohn's disease, and your recent experiences with vaping. Together, we've explored how boredom in retirement has impacted your vaping use, and we've talked about how filling your days with hobbies and creating a personal schedule could help reduce or replace vaping. We discussed how you could reconnect with the musical instruments and knitting hobbies you enjoy, and also consider new pursuits to keep you engaged. It sounds like you’re beginning to envision a path forward that aligns with your long-term health goals and brings back structure to your daily life. If there's more you'd like to discuss or plan in the future, I'm here to support you."

You've highlighted key supports and motivators: your role as a parent, your health, and the desire for more energy and control. It's clear that you're interested in pursuing a healthier lifestyle, aligning with what's important to you. As you reflect on our conversation today, feel free to think about the next steps that might feel right for you. Thanks again for sharing this journey with me, and I hope it provides some food for thought. Take care."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time today. I'm glad you're here. To start, would you mind sharing a bit about your experience with smoking and what it's been like for you recently?"
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,"Well for me, I am more of a ritualistic smoker. It gets me out of the office for 15 minutes and gives me some time to decompress."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,Stepping outside for those 15 minutes gives you a chance to unwind from the office environment.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Yes exactly.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"What are some of the other reasons, besides decompression, that you continue to smoke?"
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,"I feel like it helps me with stress. I know that is a bi-product of the nicotine addiction, but when I feel stressed I want to smoke and it helps level me out."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"Smoking feels like it eases your stress in the moment, even though you recognize it's also tied to the cycle of nicotine addiction."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Yep. I am fully aware that it is part of the addiction.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"Smoking offers a temporary escape and stress relief for you, yet there's also this awareness that it's part of the addiction cycle, which might leave you wondering about healthier ways to handle stress."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Perhaps. Before I smoked regularly I would go on walks during breaks to get some physical exercise - which relieved stress. But I actually got a pretty severe injury years ago that impacts that.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,Tell me more about the injury and how it has impacted your stress relief routines.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,"I was hit by a vehicle while running to the gym. I had a full shoulder separation requiring reconstructive surgery, broken hip, femur, and several ribs. Two years of rehab"
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"What has it been like coping with stress since the injury, after such a significant change to your routines?"
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,"Incredibly challenging. Especially because this happened during COVID lockdowns, while my father was also going through cancer treatment. The last four years have sucked."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"The past few years have been incredibly overwhelming, dealing with severe physical recovery, the isolation of COVID, and your father's cancer, yet in the face of all this, you've found ways to cope, even if smoking became part of that process."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Thank you. I have tried to transition towards using a vaporizer more than cigarettes but struggle with it sometimes.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"You've found some relief in transitioning to a vaporizer over cigarettes, suggesting an openness to change, but it hasn't been an easy or consistently successful shift, as the comfort of old habits pulls you back."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,"Well mostly its that vaporizers don't produce the ""throat"" feel of smoking. Years ago you could get vape liquid with higher percentage of propylene glycol which gives a throat hit. Now you cant"
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,What thoughts or questions do you have regarding these changes in vaping liquids and how it affects your smoking habits?
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,I don't really have many questions in particular. I am pretty well researched in the aspect of vaping. I did successfully quit smoking for almost 5 years using a vaporizer previously.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,What were some of the things that helped you quit smoking successfully before with the vaporizer?
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,"I am a geek - and so building my own coils using materials like kanthal, nichrome, nickle, SS316, etc., I found to be super interesting. Also mixing my own vape juice and experimenting with flavors."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"Finding excitement and creativity in building and experimenting allowed you to focus on something engaging and positive, which was a key part of your success in quitting smoking before."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Yes but that sort of thing has become less common. I can't just go to the local shop and buy wire anymore to make my own coils.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"The changes in vaping supplies have made it harder to engage with something you once enjoyed, yet there's a history of successfully managing your smoking with your creativity and resourcefulness."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Yes but there is also legislation being passed to restrict the flavors available for vaporizer products because of the concern it poses to teenagers. Which I understand. But disagree with.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,What concerns or thoughts do you have about how these legislative changes might influence your smoking habits or transition to vaping?
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,"Well I am a single cigarette smoker. American Spirit Yellow. I also have a favorite vape flavor. If my favorite vape flavor is no longer available, I will just continue to buy cigarettes."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"You value the specific flavors that make vaping enjoyable for you and are concerned about future restrictions, yet there's a history of successfully using vaping to quit smoking and a desire to find a way that works for you again."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Yes but I only use one flavor basically.
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"Finding that perfect vape flavor keeps you connected to vaping, but with restrictions on flavors looming, you're weighing the simplicity of sticking with cigarettes against the desire you’ve had to step away from smoking in the past."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Yep
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"You've shared that smoking gave you a chance to decompress and handle stress, especially after coping with a challenging injury, and during difficult times like your father's illness. Though vaping was a successful path before, recent restrictions have made it more difficult for you to go back to it. Despite these challenges, you have a strong sense of resourcefulness and the ability to adapt when motivated, like when you engaged your creativity in building vape coils and mixing flavors."
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,client,Yeah that is a pretty good synopsis
65df45b4b6c4eeb9240e1603,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to share with me today. We've reached the end of our session, and I'd like to recap our conversation. We talked about how smoking helps you decompress during office breaks, offering a momentary stress relief. You also shared the challenges you've faced, such as your injury and the subsequent recovery during difficult times, including your father's illness, and how smoking was part of managing those stressors. We explored how vaping was a successful alternative for you before, engaging your creativity in building coils and mixing flavors, though recent legislative changes and restrictions have added complexity to returning to vaping. Despite these challenges, your ability to adapt and use your resourcefulness shone through as you navigated these experiences. If you have anything you'd like to add or discuss further next time, I'm here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to our next conversation."

60ede71b5261321901a2a31c,counsellor,"You've talked about smoking helping you enjoy some ""me time,"" giving you space for self-reflection, and a chance to think about life in general. It sounds like these moments are important to you. Is there anything else about smoking that's important for us to explore?"
60ede71b5261321901a2a31c,client,no

5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,I don't think that I could give up smoking if I tried
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"Letting go of smoking could feel like facing a battle you're unsure you can win right now, but sometimes even small victories can gradually lead to big changes."
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,"Specific to smoking, I don't have any confidence for the slightest change"
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,What are some of the challenges or fears you think you might face if you were to consider cutting back on smoking?
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,"Worsening mental health, mood swings, physical problems from quitting, changing my routine"
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"You're really concerned about how your mental and physical well-being might be affected during the quitting process, but there may be small steps you can explore that won't completely upend your routine."

5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,Would you like me to share some small changes or information that other people have found helpful when they started thinking about reducing their smoking?
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,Yes please
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"Some people find it helpful to start with small changes, like delaying their first cigarette of the day by 10 minutes, as a way to gradually build confidence and feel a bit more in control of their smoking habits. Would that be something you’d be curious to know more about, or is there something else you're interested in discussing when it comes to smoking?"
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,I admit the first cigarette of the day is very problematic
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"You really depend on that first cigarette to get your day started, but on some level, there's a part of you that's open to the idea that this habit might be more problematic than you'd like."
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,"Definitely, I haven't considered delaying it before"
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"That morning cigarette has been a reliable part of your routine and provides comfort and predictability, but there's also a growing curiosity in you about trying something new, like delaying it."
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,It could be a start
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"You've been open about how deeply smoking is entrenched in your daily life, especially with that first cigarette providing comfort. There's worry about both mental and physical challenges of quitting, but at the same time, you're open to exploring how something as simple as delaying that cigarette could be a gentle step towards gaining more control. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about before we consider what this could look like for you?"
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,client,"Cravings management, and distractions"
5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"What are some activities or strategies that have helped you manage cravings in the past, or are there new things you might be interested in trying?"

5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,"Experimenting with activities like going for a short walk, engaging in a hobby you enjoy, or simply practicing deep breathing exercises could serve as distractions and help manage cravings, allowing you to gradually replace the habit with something that feels fulfilling for you."

As you think about incorporating positive reinforcement and small changes into your routine, what aspects of your life do you feel might benefit the most from these efforts?"

5c4e38f4d3a5e300018363ba,counsellor,...giving you a sense of control and easing into this transition in a way that feels achievable.

You’re inspired by the idea of change and open to gradually integrating strategies like engaging in positive distractions and rewarding yourself for progress.

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"What influenced you to start smoking at such a young age, and what kept you smoking over the years?"
5da74e9437d4210016492810,client,My father influenced me to start smoking at such a young age and I kept smoking because I became addicted.
5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"You’ve had a long history with smoking, and addiction has played a significant role in keeping you hooked."

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"You’ve felt that smoking might help ward off certain conditions like dementia, but you’re also noticing its negative impact on your physical health. It seems like there’s a bit of a balance you’re trying to figure out between those two sides."

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"You’re recognizing smoking's impact on your health, even though you have this belief about its potential benefit against dementia, but you're contemplating how it's affecting your body now."

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,How do you feel about the idea of quitting or cutting down on smoking at this point in your life?
5da74e9437d4210016492810,client,I'm not ready to quit because every time I try to quit I get sick..
5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"You find that quitting makes you feel sick, which keeps you from stopping, yet there's still a part of you that is wondering what life could be like without smoking."

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"Quitting has been tough because it makes you feel sick, yet you're curious about the possibility of living free from smoking's effects on your health."

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"Finding yourself turning to food to fill the gap left by smoking signals an attempt to comfort yourself, which then leads to physical discomfort. This cycle can be both challenging and difficult to break on your own."
5da74e9437d4210016492810,client,No kidding
5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,Redirecting this discomfort and finding a healthier balance could make the transition feel more manageable while improving your overall well-being.

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,"There are various approaches that people find helpful, such as nicotine replacement therapy, prescription medications, or cognitive-behavioral strategies to manage cravings. How do these options sound to you?"
5da74e9437d4210016492810,client,I can't afford nicotine replacement therapy. Stop smoking medications cause side effects which I don't like. Cognitive behavioral strategies sound like a bunch of hogwash.
5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,What are some other approaches or strategies you've thought about for replacing smoking with something healthier or less harmful?
5da74e9437d4210016492810,client,I thought about having an intimate relationship that might help me quit

5da74e9437d4210016492810,counsellor,Tell me about the kinds of conversations you'd like to have that could support your journey to quitting smoking.

67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,client,I started smoking 7 years ago after completing high school. It started out as experimenting then it got to a point where I was doing it to calm my nerves.
67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,counsellor,...and now it's become more than just a habit; it's something you rely on during stressful times.

67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,client,It would raise my self esteem since I have to hide while doing it because of the stigma attached to smoking. I feel embarassed about it.
67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,counsellor,"On one hand, you're using smoking as a way to deal with anxiety, but on the other, there's a strong desire to quit because it could boost your self-esteem and allow you to avoid the embarrassment and stigma that come with it."

67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,counsellor,"What are some small steps you might consider taking toward quitting, while still managing your anxiety?"
67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,client,I can start by reducing the number of cigarettes I smoke and try meditation.
67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,counsellor,"By deciding to reduce smoking and explore meditation, you're already paving a path towards the self-esteem and health benefits you're aiming for."
67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,client,Thank you.
67331fdd86b4228081ad704d,counsellor,"You're very welcome. It's been great talking with you today, and I appreciate you sharing your thoughts and plans.

5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. Could you share a little bit about your journey with smoking and what brings you here to talk about it?
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,"I am trying to quit and can go a few days without, but then smoke again"
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"You’re already making an effort by managing to go a few days without smoking, which shows you have some strength and motivation to quit."
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,the motivation is definitely there
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"Your commitment to quit smoking speaks volumes about your determination, and your ability to hold out for a few days shows you have the willpower to make changes. What do you think makes it difficult to keep going after a few days without smoking?"
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,routine and boredom
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"You find comfort in the routine and it fills up moments of boredom, but there's a part of you that really wants to break free from smoking."
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,correct
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"Routine and boredom pull you towards smoking, but they also give you the clarity to see what you’re up against, revealing the path you’re keen to create for yourself, free from the habit."
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,i agree
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,What do you think draws you to smoking during those routine moments or when boredom hits?
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,the idea that i enjoy it
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"You enjoy the idea of smoking and its familiarity, but deep down, you're motivated to step away from it and create a different routine for yourself."
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,absolutely
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"It's truly inspiring how you're actively seeking to align your actions with your desire for change, even when the enjoyment tries to cloud that intention. What do you imagine your life might be like if you moved past the enjoyment tied to smoking and were able to fully embrace a smoke-free routine?"
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,i would save money and feel healthier
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"You can already envision a healthier lifestyle and see the financial benefits of quitting, which shows your clear and hopeful path towards change."
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,thank you
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"Now that we've looked at both the challenges and possibilities, is there anything else about your smoking experience or your path forward that you’d like to explore?"
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,not really
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,counsellor,"Thank you for meeting with me, and for sharing your smoking journey. We've talked about your challenges with routine and boredom and how these moments lead back to smoking. You've expressed strong motivation to quit, recognizing that moving past the enjoyment could lead to saving money and feeling healthier. Your determination to change is quite evident, and I’m glad we had this opportunity to explore your thoughts and feelings around smoking.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
5e52584cc9f6062582d99041,client,No
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I'm curious, what does smoking mean to you in your daily life?"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"A break from life, relief from stress"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,Smoking gives you a way to step back and relieve stress.
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Yes
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,Smoking provides a necessary moment of escape for you amidst life’s stresses.
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Yes?
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,What else can you tell me about how smoking fits into your life?
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Nothing really. Everything else about it in my life is all negative
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"Smoking offers you stress relief, but you're seeing how it also brings negatives to your life."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"Yep, that's is indeed what I said lol"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"On one hand, smoking gives you some stress relief, but on the other hand, you’re feeling weighed down by the negatives it brings."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Yes
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,Share with me some of these negative impacts you’ve noticed.
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"It's expensive, makes me feel sick, makes me smell bad, I have to go outside to do it, strangers are constantly asking me for free cigarettes"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"Even though smoking provides breaks and stress relief, the cost, health effects, and inconvenience are quite burdensome."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"My doctor recommends that I don't worry too much about quitting right now, because I have several mental and physical conditions that could be heavily impacted by quitting. Would you agree with her?"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,Would it be alright to explore your thoughts and feelings about your doctor's advice and how it fits into your situation?
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"I want to quit smoking, but she says the stress from doing so could cause a tipping point in my health. But I hate smoking. It's so expensive"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"Your doctor wishes to protect your health by advising against quitting immediately, though you're out of patience with smoking and eager to free yourself from its grip."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"Yes. I've tried vaping and other smoking cessation methods, but it's not the same. And she recommends against vaping."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"You've tried different methods like vaping, and while transitioning has its challenges, your frustration with smoking's impact drives you to find a way to quit."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Yes.
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,Your determination to quit and willingness to explore different options show a strong drive to make a change in your life. What benefits do you envision in your life once you're able to quit smoking?
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,I'll have more money to spend on more useful things. Though I suppose one could argue that right now I'm spending that money on not causing a tipping point in my health.
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"Although the cost of smoking currently serves in protecting your health, you're already imagining the financial relief and value quitting would bring."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Yes
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"It feels like the financial burden of smoking is clashing with its current role in stabilizing your health, yet your long-term vision values the freedom and benefits of quitting even more."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Yes? I'm not really sure where you're going with all of this.
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"What do you think would help you start moving towards quitting smoking, at a pace that considers both your health needs and your desire for change?"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,I don't know
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,Would it be okay if we continued exploring your thoughts and feelings around smoking to help guide our conversation toward what feels most supportive for you?
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,Sure
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"How do you see smoking fitting into your life in the future, considering both your current health and your desire for change?"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,I see things staying as they are now
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"Together, we can explore the positives and negatives of smoking in your life so when you're ready, you can decide what changes might feel right for you."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"Okay? I prefer more of a ""Here's some options to explore, what do you think?"" rather than this kind of approach. I'm a very action-oriented person."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"If you're interested, we can explore some actionable steps that align with your desire for change while considering your health needs."
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,yes please
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"While considering your doctor's advice, you might want to explore small, manageable changes like reducing smoking gradually or trying new stress-relief techniques to support both your health and desire for change. How does this approach sound to you?"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,client,"I like the idea of getting to the root of the habit and addressing it. Like, sometimes I go for smokes because I want to go for a walk, or get away from the desk for a while. I have ADHD"
65465e327a889724c907f3e4,counsellor,"Thank you for your time today. As we wrap up our session, I'd like to take a moment to summarize our conversation. You've shared that smoking serves as a break and stress reliever for you, yet it brings several negatives into your life, including health concerns, financial strain, and social challenges. Your doctor has shared concerns regarding quitting right now due to the potential impact on your overall health, which echoes the complexity of your situation. Despite this, your determination to quit is strong, and you're already envisioning the financial freedom it could bring.

We explored the possibility of small, manageable changes to address your smoking habits, such as identifying alternative stress-relief activities that could align with your needs. You recognized that sometimes smoking fulfills a need, like taking a walk or stepping away from your desk, and it’s great that you're considering addressing the root of the habit especially with ADHD considerations.

I appreciate your openness and willingness to explore this topic today. If there’s anything else you’d like to discuss or if you have any questions about what we've covered, please feel free to bring them up in our future sessions."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Thank you for agreeing to have this conversation with me. To start things off, I'd love to hear about your experience with smoking. What's it like for you right now?"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,"I don't consider myself to be a heavy smoker, some days I only smoke one or two, but if I am drinking or socialising, it's easy for me to smoke much more. I'm not too concerned about this right now"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,Tell me more about the role smoking plays when you're socializing or drinking. What do you notice about those times?
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,"I feel a need for a cigarette when I drink, or sometimes I even look forward to drinking just so I can have a cigarette with a drink"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"You enjoy the connection and relaxation that come with smoking while socializing, yet it sounds like there might be a part of you that's curious about experiencing those moments without relying on cigarettes."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,Yes that's correct
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,Perhaps you're starting to wonder how those social connections and relaxation might feel if they didn’t depend on having a cigarette.
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,I think that's true. I'd like to disconnect from the association of socialising and smoking
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"You're really considering the possibility of finding new ways to enjoy socializing without the need for smoking, which shows that you're in control of what role smoking plays in these moments. What are some ways you've imagined enjoying social settings without smoking?"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,"I think socialising without alcohol involved is useful, as alcohol can be a catalyst. It is hard for me to imagine socialising without smoking though"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Socializing with alcohol has been a strong trigger for smoking, but you're curious about how shifting your social activities away from alcohol might help ease the connection with cigarettes."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,Yes that's true
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,Tell me more about how you'd like your social experiences to feel without the influence of smoking or alcohol.
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,I'd like to feel relaxed and at ease without the need for alcohol. I think I depend on alcohol sometimes to help me unwind and feel more like myself. Smoking is something that I'm just addicted to
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Smoking feels like a strong addiction, and yet there's a part of you that's eager to find relaxation and confidence in social settings without leaning on alcohol or cigarettes."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,Yes
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,What are some things you've tried or considered trying that might help you relax and feel more at ease without relying on smoking or alcohol?
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,"I've tried getting into running, which helped a lot and I did actually quit smoking. It was during the lockdown though, and I started smoking again once pubs reopened."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Running brought a sense of health and an opportunity to quit smoking during lockdown, yet when social venues opened up, the pull of previous habits proved strong, but there's still a desire to find healthier ways to unwind."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,That's true
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"What would it look like for you to integrate running or similar activities back into your routine now, considering what you've experienced before?"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,I think I'd really need to push myself to do that. Currently I have no desire to make such big changes in my life. And I don't see alcohol and smoking as that big of a problem for me right now
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Running helped you before to navigate big changes like quitting smoking, suggesting that you already have tools in your repertoire, even if you're not feeling inclined to use them right now."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,That's true. Although I don't really enjoy running as much as I used to. I have started going to the gym recently though and that has been very useful. I don't think it's would help me quit though
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"You're finding the gym useful and building new habits that support well-being, though at the moment, quitting smoking isn't a major concern for you. Balancing these things might bring new insights over time."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,I think I would want to be in a place where I'm more stable and feel ready to quit smoking. I think it would be something that I'd do for my mental health moreso. As smoking can make me more anxious
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Tell me more about how smoking affects your mental health, especially when it comes to feeling anxious."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,"Sometimes after I smoke I can feel quite panicked, with a higher heart rate. I also find it easier to feel anxiety throughout my body, such as being more alert and shaking a lot"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Smoking brings about heightened anxiety and physical reactions that make you less comfortable, which contrasts with your desire for mental stability, suggesting an opportunity to explore change for your well-being."
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,"Yes, that's definitely a good opportunity for change"
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,Understanding that smoking sometimes escalates anxiety and could be seen as a helpful step toward feeling more grounded and mentally resilient.
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,Yes that's true. But I do enjoy smoking and I feel like when I drink I will always be tempted to smoke
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,What are some ways you might explore creating a new relationship with alcohol where smoking feels less tempting?
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,Maybe being open with friends and people I'm around to make sure that I don't give into the temptation of smoking when I'm out with them
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,How might conversations with your friends open the door to feeling supported in avoiding smoking during social gatherings?
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,client,It would add a layer of accountability and give me more pressure to continue with quitting smoking
5ecf26c3602f7f356771bf72,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. As we wrap up our conversation, let's take a moment to reflect on what we've discussed. You've been thoughtful about understanding your relationship with smoking, particularly how it connects with socializing and drinking. You've expressed an interest in exploring ways to enjoy socializing without relying on cigarettes and noticed how smoking can sometimes heighten anxiety. You mentioned running had been helpful before and that you're finding value in going to the gym now. And when it comes to creating a supportive environment with your friends, you see the potential for accountability to help you resist temptation when drinking. Your focus on mental health and resilience highlights how mindful you already are about your well-being. Thank you again for your openness today, and if you have any more thoughts or questions, I'm here to support you."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. I’m curious, what led you to consider having this conversation about your smoking?"
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,I am quite an open person so I am looking forward to hear what you have to say
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,What do you hope to get out of our conversation today?
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,I do hope i get some really good answers from you.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,What is your smoking life like right now?
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,"Its quite casual and i don't make a big deal out of it, its as frequent as it can get."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"It seems like smoking is just a part of your routine, so you've probably given some thought to what it brings to your life."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,"Yes i can say its somewhat a routine, it brings the sense of peace and easiness to carry on with things."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,Smoking helps you feel peace and easiness.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,Yes i must say.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"It’s understandable that smoking brings peace and easiness, but perhaps there have been moments when it didn't feel that way."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,Yes i've had my moments too where it feels like its taking a whole part of me and thats not who i tend to be but its quite few.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"Help me understand, what's it like when you feel that smoking is taking a part of you that you don't want it to?"
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,It somewhat gives me a different outlook and i tend to be more chilled sometimes when i'm supposed to put the effort.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"You enjoy when smoking helps you feel relaxed and chilled, especially during stressful times, yet there's a part of you that thinks it's important to stay engaged and put effort into things."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,"Exactly, thats quite accurate, but i just tend to prioritize peace a whole lot."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"You cherish peace and relaxation, but there are also times when you feel staying engaged and present is equally important."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,"Yes it is, i feel like i am in that point in life where i need to invest the time and energy."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,Tell me more about what investing time and energy means for you right now.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,"It means having to do stuffs, read books, take some personal health courses and keep fit"
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,Taking these steps could really help you grow and enhance the peace you're seeking in life.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,I really do know about that but sometimes it feels quite overwhelming.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"Finding balance can be overwhelming, yet the steps you're considering could lead to positive changes and personal growth."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,Yes i know it could lead to positive changes and personal growth.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,What makes it important for you to invest this time and energy into personal growth right now?
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,"I think its time i do that now for a better tomorrow, to become a better person in the society."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"It sounds like you're really focusing on creating a better future for yourself by making changes today, and I think it's worth exploring how smoking fits into this vision."
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,client,Smoking isnt a form of hindrance but i can do things better without it but scared of times i would be at my lowest.
672b7d44ca2394e30e6092ab,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing with me today. We've reached the end of our session, so let's go over what we've discussed. You mentioned that smoking gives you a sense of peace and helps you relax, even though there are times when it feels like it's taking a part of you that you don't want it to.

66b0103854c074757187d029,client,"the smell of it and the feeling I get from it, helps me focus on my day"
66b0103854c074757187d029,counsellor,"When you think about your day-to-day routines or what happens when you pick up a cigarette, what else comes to mind about the role smoking plays for you?"

66b0103854c074757187d029,counsellor,"And yet, there might be moments when relying on it feels like it could be a burden."
66b0103854c074757187d029,client,not sure it is a burden from the way it makes me feel sometimes
66b0103854c074757187d029,counsellor,"You feel like smoking gives you comfort and helps you focus, still there's a sense that relying on it all the time might sometimes create a different kind of need."

66b0103854c074757187d029,counsellor,"You feel in control and motivated with smoking, but there's also a part of you that wonders about the reliance on it."

66b0103854c074757187d029,counsellor,"While smoking is a comfort and helps you maintain focus, there's a part of you that notices its impact on relationships with people around you and perhaps raises questions about these interactions."
66b0103854c074757187d029,client,meaning I'm affecting some people with my smoking right?
66b0103854c074757187d029,counsellor,"While your smoking is something you've become accustomed to and rely on, it's interesting how it might unintentionally create boundaries with some people you care about."

66b0103854c074757187d029,client,relay matters because if I can lose them then I can lose family members too
66b0103854c074757187d029,counsellor,"You've found comfort in smoking, losing friends over it is deeply concerning, holding onto those friendships and even family is more important to you."

665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,"The mental aspect of smoking provides you with comfort and satisfaction for now, and you also wish there was a way to reconcile that with your desire to quit eventually."
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,is there a way?
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,Is it alright if we talk about some strategies that might help with quitting when you're ready?
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,sure
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,"One approach that we could explore together is breaking down the reasons for smoking and the barriers to quitting into smaller, manageable steps, whenever you feel ready to dive into that."
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,ok
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,Understanding what draws you to smoking and what pulls you towards quitting can help you decide what feels right for you.
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,ok
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,"You recognize smoking is pulling you one way, yet you're still open to finding a path that could eventually lead you to feel comfortable exploring change."
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,yes
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,Holding onto what has been familiar and comforting while also feeling drawn toward the possibility of change.
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,i guess
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,"You've shared that addiction feels very real and quitting seems daunting because of how good smoking makes you feel mentally, despite not liking the taste or smell. This is a tough place, finding that balance between comfort from smoking and the wish to move away from it."
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,i gotta go now . you have a name?
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,"Of course, you're always welcome to reach out whenever you're ready to talk again. My name is here to help, focusing on your journey. Take care and see you next time!"
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,whats your name?
665ba6320399db768cb43621,counsellor,"Thank you for having this conversation with me today. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far. You've shared that you want to quit smoking because of the taste and smell, yet the addiction feels very real and strong. There's a part of you that feels comforted by smoking, making it challenging to think about quitting. We talked a bit about exploring what draws you to both continue and quit, and perhaps breaking it down into manageable steps. If you ever want to revisit this, feel free to reach out. Take care!

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
665ba6320399db768cb43621,client,No
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I appreciate your willingness to talk. I'm curious to know a little more about your smoking. What do you enjoy most about it, and what concerns, if any, do you have about your smoking habits?"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"I don't have any concerns, i think smoking is a enjoyable way to get rid of stress, and i enjoy the actual action of smoking, it goes really well with coffee in the morning."
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,Smoking feels like a satisfying way for you to unwind and pairs nicely with your morning coffee.
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"correct, i don't have a particular addiction, i just prefer to partake in stress relief and enjoy a couple minutes with my coffee!"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"So right now, smoking feels more like a preference for handling stress and enjoying a moment with your coffee."
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"correct! i don't think smoking by itself is something i tend to do, it tends to happen when i want coffee, or when i see others smoking, do you have any insight why that happens?"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,Would it be alright with you if we explore some of those situations together and see where they're coming from?
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,sure!
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,Tell me more about the situations where you find yourself smoking with coffee or around others. What are those moments like for you?
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"well i generally smoke with my coffee, because it helps the flavor profile of the coffee and premium tobacco especially!"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,What about smoking when you see others enjoying it? How does that experience feel for you?
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"It generally a social thing, like how there are social drinkers, that wouldn't drink on their own without the social context"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"Having a cigarette during social gatherings serves as a way for you to feel connected with others, much like sharing a meal or enjoying a chat over drinks."
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"exactly, and if you don't have a way to unwind your stress, you'll fill it with something that might be outwardly destructive compared to smoking, which only harms yourself"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"You enjoy smoking as a means of relaxation and social involvement, but you don't see it as harmful as long as it's only affecting yourself. However, there's a possibility that alternatives could also help manage your stress and still allow you to enjoy social times without the downsides."
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"i'm listening to your opinion and enjoy the insight, but i do see it as harmful, but harming yourself to de-stress is better than say alcohol where some people get violent but both harm"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"You acknowledge the potential harm of smoking to yourself as a way to de-stress and stay non-violent because of it, yet there might be alternatives that help you handle stress without the need for a harmful behavior."
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,fair express some of those less harmful behaviors for me!
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,Would you like me to share some ideas that others have found helpful in reducing stress?
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,yes!
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"Some people find that activities like going for a walk, practicing deep breathing, or trying a new hobby can provide a refreshing way to handle stress without the downside of harming their health."
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"Some people aren't able to safely walk through their neighborhoods, and don't have the economic opportunity for hobbies, what would you say to those people?"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,What are some ways you've thought about handling stress in challenging situations like those?
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"I think self reflection can help a lot, most people that have problems with smoking, don't realize that the vice isn't the problem but their internal way of thinking"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,Taking time for self-reflection to understand the root of stress and its impact on smoking.
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"Correct, until you deal with a root problem it will continue to cause problems, like getting fillings on a destroyed tooth!"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"Uncovering and addressing the core issues might prevent a cycle of temporary fixes, like putting a small bandage over an underlying wound that keeps aching."
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,client,"Yes, to a further extent this applies across drugs, smoking, alcohol and all vices. a mindset that reinforces your problems instead of solving them, self control is a big part too"
66e08b10e56328c32503cdac,counsellor,"Thank you for spending this time with me. We've had an enriching conversation that has helped unpack your relationship with smoking today. You've mentioned that smoking acts as a pleasant way to de-stress, pairing nicely with coffee and social situations. At the same time, you recognize the potential harm and the false sense of resolution it might provide. We talked about exploring some healthier alternatives to manage stress which might not have the same downsides, and you reflected on the importance of understanding the root cause of habits and stress. Self-reflection and self-control, as you wisely pointed out, can play crucial roles in addressing these underlying patterns. It's been productive talking about all these aspects with you. If you'd like to explore these further or have more questions in the future, feel free to reach out."
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. To start off, can you share with me what your experience with smoking has been like?"

60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,client,Exactly that
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"...but at the same time, you might also have moments where smoking leaves you questioning its role in your life."
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,client,"Not quite , I do however think of the consequences"
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"You're aware that smoking helps you unwind, but there's also a part of you that thinks about the consequences and what that might mean."

60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"While smoking helps you unwind, there's also a strong desire to find out how your health and overall well-being may change for the better if you choose to quit."

60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"It's wonderful to see you exploring both the benefits of smoking and how you might feel without it.

When you think about the possibility of quitting, what comes to mind in terms of what might help or challenge you on that journey?"
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,client,"I have friends who smoke so that will challenge me , as well as just the habit of smoking .I have tried to quit once for 2 months but went back to smoking because I enjoy it,"
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"You have the enjoyment and comfort that comes from smoking, especially with friends, but there's also a part of you that's drawn to the health benefits and sense of accomplishment that could come from successfully quitting again."

60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"You're drawn to the health improvements that quitting could offer, yet the comfort and enjoyment you get from smoking still hold a strong place in your life, but those health improvements are pretty important to you."

60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,In what ways do you see your identity and desires evolving if you explore making changes to your smoking habits?
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,client,It doesnt look like I should be labeled a smoker so people don't expect it
60c0fa09ef735c52ada64d23,counsellor,"...yet it's interesting to consider how your identity might really shine if you decide not to conform to that label, allowing for new expectations beyond what others see."

5e36f76b2c324c67599cb90d,counsellor,What are some of the thoughts or feelings you have about maybe exploring this dependency further?

5e36f76b2c324c67599cb90d,counsellor,"You've grown accustomed to the morning cigarette boost, but you're open to understanding if there's a deeper reason behind this need, which could lead to new insights about how smoking fits into your life."

5e36f76b2c324c67599cb90d,client,"I see, would maybe a cigarette substitute to keep my hands busy work"

We've talked about how smoking plays a calming role in your life and has become a routine, especially first thing in the morning. You're curious about exploring whether there's a deeper reason behind this dependency and what it might mean to you. We discussed the possibility of starting your day differently, acknowledging the concerns about cravings and fears of failure, yet also your interest in imagining a morning without a cigarette.

Together, we brainstormed ways to manage cravings, like keeping your hands busy or finding alternatives. You're exploring thoughts on cigarette substitutes that might help you with that.

60c57903a2db0249ed2779b1,counsellor,"Thank you for spending time with me today. As we wrap up, I'd like to go over what we've discussed so far. We've talked about how smoking is more of a habitual or boredom-filling activity for you, but you're not particularly proud of it. You've expressed internal conflicts, where smoking provides you with a means to cope with stress, yet you feel the strong desire to do better for your health and family. 

There are moments of imagining a future where you breathe easier and create a healthier environment for your family. The idea of stress reduction ties into your ability to change and make different choices about smoking. While managing stress without smoking is something you haven't experienced yet, there's curiosity about what life could be like if calmness took a firmer hold.

This is a process, and it's encouraging to explore the possibilities of change at your own pace. If there are any other thoughts or reflections you have, I'd be happy to hear them. Thank you again for your openness today."

You've shared the challenges of smoking both dodgy cigarettes and vaping, primarily due to stress relief from work and your social life. You've expressed concern about the physical effects, especially on your skin, which suggests your health and appearance are important to you. Your work is quite physical, and although it involves dealing with some unpleasant situations that increase your stress, these cigarettes act as a break companion. You're interested in exploring other ways to relieve stress, like perhaps mixing your coffee with another comforting routine during your breaks. Feel free to let me know when you're ready to explore more alternatives. Have a good night's rest, and I look forward to hearing how things go tomorrow.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
5e7d790c0d34ae3fef75c74e,client,No
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm curious to learn more about what brings you here to discuss smoking. What's your experience with smoking been like?
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,I'm here because I'm participating in a research study.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"What is your relationship with smoking like, and how does it affect your daily life?"
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,I've been a smoker for 20+ years.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,Tell me about how smoking fits into your life—what does it mean to you?
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,"It comes as natural. I don't see smoking is a fit or not, it's just part of my daily routine like drinking water as the day goes by."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"It's just a natural part of your day, as if removing it could create a gap hard to fill."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,Removing it suddenly will be very difficult.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"Letting go of smoking suddenly feels like a daunting task because it's deeply ingrained in your routine, yet there's a part of you that may wonder if there's a different path that could be explored."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,"Yes, sometimes I feel like my breathing can be better if I get rid of this habit."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"By acknowledging the impact on your breathing, you're recognizing your power to assess how smoking fits into your life, and you have the capability to decide what changes, if any, you might want to consider in the future. As you think about the role smoking plays in your breathing and overall well-being, what other thoughts or feelings come up for you?"
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,"I understand the dire consequences to my health, but there no urgency in me to quit. This is the main reason I haven't really taken any actions."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"You understand the potential threats to your health and it's important to you, but you haven't felt the urgency to make a change yet, which makes it hard to take any steps forward."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,That sums up my thought.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"Your self-awareness about your health and the factors involved shows your thoughtful approach towards your decisions, even when it doesn't lead to immediate action. What would your life look like if you imagined the possibility of quitting smoking, even without the pressure of urgency?"
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,I know I can definitely save some money if I quit.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"It's promising that you're exploring the financial benefits, and it highlights that you have the power to weigh different aspects of smoking, consider what feels most beneficial to you, and decide what steps might be right for your future. As you consider the financial aspect, what other potential benefits or concerns come to your mind about possibly quitting smoking?"
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,My health will be better that's for sure. And I can decrease my chance of getting some smoking related terminal illness.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"You've lived with smoking as a daily companion and not felt the urgency to quit, yet you're starting to see potential benefits to your health and finances, and that makes you wonder about the possibility of change."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,Yes that's about correct.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"You haven't felt any pressure to quit because smoking has become a natural part of your routine, but you see potential benefits like better health and financial savings that make you think about the change."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,"Not entirely not pressure, in the back of my head I do fear I may get sick in the future because of my smoking habit. But I don't have the urgency to make the change."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"In your day-to-day life, how do you experience the balance between the comfort of smoking and the underlying fear of potential health risks?"
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,"When ever I feel shortness of breath, the inner conflicts arise."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"Although you've lived with the comfort of smoking as part of your routine for years, these moments of shortness of breath remind you that you want to decrease your risks, indicating a growing awareness of the potential benefits of change."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,Yes
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,Moments of shortness of breath bring fear of future health issues and temporary relief after smoking. You find yourself considering the potential benefits of quitting.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,I find myself maybe it's time to change because fear for my own health.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"In those moments of fear and awareness, what kinds of changes do you find yourself considering, even if they're just thoughts right now?"
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,"I thought about smoke in a less frequency throughout the day, but I know this won't really work. I also thought about trying nicotine gums or sprays. But I haven't took any actions, just thoughts."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"Trying to reduce smoking on your own seems challenging, yet deep down, you've considered options like nicotine gums or sprays because of your concern for your health."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,"Some what in a way, yes."
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,You're thinking about easing into change gently by exploring options that might support you in making adjustments.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,I thought about what I can do to dial it down as oppose to an abrupt cessation.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,What would you like to focus on when considering ways to dial it down gradually?
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,client,A plan that works.
595bdc5b57e9520001f78eef,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. We've had an insightful conversation, exploring your journey with smoking, and I appreciate how openly you've talked about it. Initially, you shared how smoking has been a natural part of your routine for over 20 years, and you've not felt urgency to quit. Yet, along the way, you've begun to recognize the impacts on your health and possible financial benefits of quitting. Moments of shortness of breath have prompted you to think about change, although taking action hasn't come easy. You've considered options like reducing smoking throughout the day or exploring nicotine replacements like gums or sprays. You're seeking a plan that accommodates gradual steps rather than sudden cessation, all rooted in a genuine care for your health. Your willingness to reflect on these possibilities has been significant. If there's anything specific you'd like to add before we wrap up, feel free, and we'll continue this dialogue when you're ready."

We then discussed your interest in creative activities like drawing, knitting, designing, singing, and playing guitar. You expressed how these pursuits could not only help you relax by quieting your mind in a healthier way but also bring unexpected improvements to your life, such as forming connections and exploring work opportunities.

We talked about the idea of setting a regular routine for these activities and acknowledged some concern around how they might not completely eliminate the cravings from smoking.

67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"You rely on smoking as a vice you don't love, but this also means there's a part of you that might desire change."
67363452674f3db8059e7888,client,"I suppose i want to quit someday, but this is a bad time."
67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"You're dealing with a tough time, and quitting feels overwhelming right now, though you do have a future desire to stop smoking."

67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,What impact does knowing others care about you have on your thoughts about smoking and possibly quitting?
67363452674f3db8059e7888,client,the only reason i would do it
67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"You're relying on smoking to manage your stress right now, but the thought of quitting becomes more appealing when you consider the people who care about you."

67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"What helped you make those changes with alcohol and marijuana, and how does that influence your thoughts about smoking?"
67363452674f3db8059e7888,client,"cigarettes and coffee only...if you told me a year ago this is what my life would be, i would have laughed in your face."
67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"Though you're holding onto cigarettes and coffee as your last vices, the strong changes you've already made reveal the strength and capacity for further change, maybe even with smoking when you feel ready."

67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"You've achieved a lot already by giving up alcohol and marijuana—despite the doubts you might have had—showing a strong ability to adapt and change, even while cigarettes remain a challenging habit right now."

67363452674f3db8059e7888,client,"yes and he hates the smell of cigarettes. he would prefer i go back to drinking, but the courts would not likely see it that way."
67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"While smoking gives you a moment of relief and a necessary control amidst life using alcohol, the changes you've made and the fact that your son dislikes the smell are pushing you towards considering another path."
67363452674f3db8059e7888,client,yes. its just that too much more change too quickly might tip my nerves as well.
67363452674f3db8059e7888,counsellor,"What strategies have helped you handle change in the past, and how could they aid you as you think about the role of smoking in your life?"

5ee39caf04e12902f1134270,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing with me today. We've reached the end of our time together, so I’d like to summarize what we've discussed. 

You've been open about your smoking routine of three times a day and how stress and addiction contribute to it. You have also recognized the negative impact smoking has on both your health and social life. Despite this, there’s a part of you that wants to explore healthier ways to manage stress and create more positive changes in your life by stopping smoking. You envision a healthier day-to-day life and have identified your access to quit-smoking aids and the support from those around you as resources that can help you.

I appreciate your willingness to explore these thoughts, and I'm here to support you in any way you need. If there's anything more you'd like to share or explore in future conversations, I'd be glad to hear it. Take care until we speak again."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. I'm curious to hear a bit about your journey with smoking. What prompted you to start smoking, and how has it become part of your life?"
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,I started smoking because I wanted a way to relax. One of my friends was smoking so I gave it a try.
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,What are some of the ways smoking helps you relax in your daily life?
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,"The sensation of smoking ""itself"" is very relaxing. I don't know exactly how it helps me relax, I just know that I feel relaxed after I have smoked a cigarette."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"What are some other situations, aside from relaxation, where you find yourself reaching for a cigarette?"
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,"I believe that every time I smoke a cigarette, it is for the benefit of relaxation. I can't think of other situations where I reach for a cigarette."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"The calming effect of smoking really draws you in, and there's comfort in that familiar routine, but you're beginning to wonder if there might be other ways to find relaxation."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,"Yes, I would like to find other ways to feel relaxed, but I have not discovered anything else that can replace that sensation."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"Finding replacement for that relaxation still feels elusive, triggering some curiosity about how life might be different without constantly relying on smoking."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,I agree with your statement. Finding a replacement that makes me feel just as relaxed as a cigarette may help me to quit smoking.
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,What kinds of activities have you thought about exploring that might help bring relaxation into your life without needing a cigarette?
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,"I thought about exercise, but this activity will make me feel more tired than relaxed."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"Exercise does leave you feeling exhausted, though finding an activity that combines relaxation with health benefits, like yoga or a gentle walk, might offer a similar sense of calm without the fatigue."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,"Trying yoga might be a good idea. I don't think that walking, every time I feel the urge to have a cigarette, will be doable."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"Yoga might be one way to ease into a new relaxation loop, though you're doubtful about the timing and practicality of taking walks every time you feel the smoke urge."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,That is correct.
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"What does the idea of trying yoga spark for you, and how might it fit into your daily rhythm?"
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,"I work from home at the moment, so I believe I would be able to at least give yoga a try."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,Allowing you to explore a new path in finding relaxation and balance amidst your workday.
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,That is correct.
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"Work from home gives you flexibility to experiment with new ways to relax, and you're curious to see if yoga could provide that much-needed calm without the stress of going outside every time you want to smoke."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,Yes.
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"Your openness to trying new things like yoga shows your willingness to explore different avenues of relaxation, which is a strong and admirable step towards making a positive change in your life. What might be some of the positive changes you envision for yourself if you find alternative ways to unwind and relax?"
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,client,"The most positive change that I can see happening if I quit smoking is being able to breath a lot better. I know that smoking is not good for me, yet it is very hard to quit."
65f880e039f4b5e8a28a37ac,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts today. We're reaching the end of our conversation, so I'll just summarize what we've discussed. You talked about how smoking has been a part of your relaxation routine, helping you find a sense of calm. While you're open to exploring other ways to bring relaxation into your life, you're particularly curious about yoga as a potential substitute. You also shared a vision of breathing better if you find alternatives to smoking and quit. It’s clear that smoking has both benefits and downsides in your life, and you're open to trying new things to enhance your feeling of wellbeing. I appreciate your openness today, and I look forward to speaking with you again whenever you're ready. Take care, and feel free to reach out anytime."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,Thank you for joining me today. Could you share a bit about what smoking means to you and how it's a part of your life right now?
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"I have a lot of stress in my life, and smoking provides me comfort. It also gives me reason to step outside, which I rarely do otherwise."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,"Finding that smoking gives you a break from the stresses of life, while providing moments to step outside and disconnect."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,That's correct.
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,Smoking offers you moments of relief and stepping outside gives you some peace; you might be wondering if there's a way to manage stress while still taking care of your health.
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"I'm aware of the many negative aspects of smoking, and that in the long run, it will lead to more stress."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,What are some of the negative aspects of smoking that concern you the most?
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"As I age, the likelihood of developing heart or lung disease, and the financial ramifications."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,"The future worries you, with thoughts of health issues and financial strain, but there's a part of you that sees smoking as a source of comfort now."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"Yes. I also acknowledge my body's physical/chemical addiction, and dread the thought of the de-toxification process."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,"The thought of going through detox is daunting, but you value your future health and financial stability, which could be improved by considering a change."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,Smoking is one of the only things in my life that I do not feel I have the mental fortitude to combat at this point. Stopping now does not seem like the best mental health plan.
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,What do you think it would take for you to feel more ready or fortified to address smoking when the time is right for you?
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"I need to get back on track with my life, be motivated by goals again. Get over the emotional issues I've been facing. To find more existential satisfaction."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,Tell me more about the things that bring you a sense of existential satisfaction.
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"Clearly, those things common to all; feeling of having lived up to my potential, perhaps raising a child- something that outlives me."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,Explore what living up to your potential and leaving a legacy mean for your own experience.

667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,Is that a question or statement?
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,Let's explore more about what drives you and what you value most when you think about your potential and legacy.
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"I have accomplished a great many things in life. Worn many hats and, according to others, should be satisfied. But rather than doing those things for personal enjoyment, I always served others."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,"Devoting yourself to the service of others while balancing expectations takes a toll, and there's a way to align your accomplishments with more personal joy and purpose."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,client,"That would be directly linked to the poor parenting I received as a child. I see that now and I continue to work on those issues. Ergo, smoking is like a friend- reliable and dependable."
667faa443e9edc9a879233fe,counsellor,"Smoking feels like a steadfast friend because of what you faced growing up, and even though you continue working on those childhood issues, there's still a desire to find personal fulfillment and joy beyond that friendship."

67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,"Balancing so many important areas in your life—finding purpose, making family proud, managing work and studies—smoking feels like a comforting pause in the whirlwind, even though you're juggling all those things with what seems to be a strong drive to succeed."

67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,"You're showing incredible resilience in managing life's pressures and striving toward your goals. Balancing so much speaks to your dedication and strength.

67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,"Smoking provides temporary relief from the pressure of not yet achieving financial freedom and genuine connections, yet it doesn't actually move you closer to these goals."
67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,client,no it doesnt
67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,"Smoking distracts you from the stress of pursuing financial freedom and genuine connections, yet there's a part of you that recognizes smoking doesn't help you achieve those important goals in the long run."

67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,"Your friend's loss highlighted the real risks of smoking and stirred a desire to reduce your own habit to avoid similar health issues, even though smoking has been a way to manage the stress you face."
67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,client,yes
67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,Realizing the impact of smoking on health while desiring a future without those risks motivates you to consider changes in your smoking habits.
67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,client,yes
67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,What are your thoughts about what it might look like for you to begin reducing your smoking?

67098fef9901cb191a8cdacb,counsellor,"Thank you so much for sharing your time and thoughts with me today. We've reached the end of our conversation for now, and I'd like to summarize what we've discussed together.

We explored the role that smoking plays in managing the stress in your life, especially as you balance various demands like work, studies, and the desire to make your family proud. Smoking has been a way for you to find some momentary relief amidst these pressures. You expressed some important wishes, such as achieving financial freedom and building genuine connections, and how smoking seems to interrupt rather than assist these goals.

We also talked about your recent realization about health risks connected to smoking, sparked by the passing of a friend's mother. Her experience deepened your reflection and brought health into sharper focus for you. The possibility of reducing smoking was connected to a sense of pride in making healthy strides for yourself.

Thank you once again for your openness in this conversation. If you want to talk more or explore next steps when you feel ready, I'm here to support you whenever you choose. Take care, and I wish you moments of calm and clarity in your ongoing journey."

63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I'm really glad we can have this conversation. To start off, could you tell me a bit about your relationship with smoking and how it's a part of your life right now?"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"I have smoked since I was 16, I'm 39 now. I have gone through periods of abstinence but recently I am smoking more than my average"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,What do you think contributes to you smoking more than your average recently?
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"I am a recovering alcholic, I've been sober for 2 weeks but the stress of this has caused my smoking to spike"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"The stress from staying sober is pushing your smoking habits up, yet you're also navigating this important journey of sobriety, which indicates your commitment to change."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"Thank you for understanding, that's true"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"Smoking has been a way for you to handle stress, especially with the challenge of staying sober, yet you have shown determination to change by focusing on your recovery from alcohol."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"I think that in the short term I will continue to smoke at an increased rate, but eventually it will plateau"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,How do you envision things changing regarding your smoking once you feel more settled in your sobriety?
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,It will regress and then I will have more mental capacity to taper off
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,What would it mean for you to reduce your smoking after you feel more balanced in your sobriety?
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,I understand the ramifications to my health that smoking causes. I invision a future where I don't smoke anymore
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,And embracing that future without smoking would mean making choices that align with your health and well-being goals.
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"Correct! I'm not naive, I know that even if/when I quit I will likely relapse, I think it's more about managing those moments"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"Even though you recognize that there might be relapses, you're focusing on the bigger picture of managing those moments and striving for a smoke-free future."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,That's right
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,Your self-awareness and realistic approach to managing smoking are valuable strengths as you work toward your goals. What do you think will be most helpful for you as you strive towards both maintaining sobriety and eventually reducing your smoking?
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"I need great stability in my life, I have little contact with my family and a lot of my friends have drifted. I feel like I need to start on the path of rebuilding a social network and maybe..."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,Tell me more about how rebuilding a social network might support your goals.
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"It would give my life great structure, a support circuit"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,Creating a social network could provide you with the structure and support you're looking for.
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"That's right, at the moment all I do is work, then come home and watch tv and work some more"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"You're seeing how a new social network could be the foundation you need to build greater stability and support, ultimately helping you balance and connect different aspects of your life."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,That's right
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"If there's anything else you'd like to explore about your smoking or broader goals, we can do that. Otherwise, we can begin to think about how to support you toward that vision of a stable, supportive social network, once you're ready."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"I feel like you've met me at the right time, I understand the roadmap to get where I want to be, I just need to stay disciplined"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"What elements of staying disciplined do you feel equipped with, and where do you think you might need additional support?"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,I need to learn better coping mechanisms
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,Would it be okay if we explore some strategies together for building new coping mechanisms?
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"Of course, that would be great"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"We can look into different ways to cope with stress and create a personalized plan that fits your life, helping you maintain discipline as you work towards your new goals."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"Ok, where do we begin"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,We could start by identifying situations or feelings that trigger stress for you and explore healthy coping mechanisms to address them.
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"There are too many factors to list, I often find myself feeling frantic at the smallest thing"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,Even small triggers can make you feel frantic.
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"Yes, I let trivial thing weigh heavy on my mind"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"We can work on identifying those stressors and finding gentle ways to ease their impact, building small steps toward more effective coping."
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"ok, that sound positive"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,Building mindfulness practices or simple breathing exercises could help you refocus and counteract those feelings when they arise.
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,client,"Go ahead, explain further"
63e51ccb431bed8154fc6aae,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. It means a lot that you shared your journey and insights. We've looked at your recent increase in smoking due to stress from maintaining sobriety, and how you've been thinking about moving toward a smoke-free future once you're stable in that area. We've touched on the importance of building a supportive social network to provide stability and help you with both sobriety and eventually reducing your smoking. We talked about being mindful of stress triggers, and starting to develop new coping mechanisms, like mindfulness or breathing exercises, as simple tools for managing those stressful moments in your life.

We can explore more when you're ready to continue this journey. I'm here to support you as you build towards the goals that matter to you. Take care until we meet again!"

673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,counsellor,"It's really insightful that you're considering having more control over your smoking, and recognizing that balance can be an important step in your journey. What are some thoughts or feelings you have about starting to gain that control over your smoking?"
673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,client,it may be hard
673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,counsellor,"It may feel daunting to change something that's been a consistent part of your life, but thinking about having more control and the possibility of finding a balance that works for you is hopeful and promising."
673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,client,ok
673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,counsellor,I admire your willingness to explore the possibility of gaining more control over your smoking habit. It's clear you're thoughtful about what it might mean in your life. What are some small steps or changes you might consider trying to begin exploring that balance and control over your smoking?

673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,counsellor,"Although it might be challenging, you see that reducing the number of times you smoke each day could help bring about more balance and control in your life."
673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,client,yeah
673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,counsellor,You want to take steps towards having more control by considering a manageable and gradual reduction in your smoking habits.

673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,counsellor,"Thank you for our conversation today. To summarize, you've shared with me how smoking is a part of your daily life, providing comfort and helping with work, yet there's a growing concern about your dependence on it. You've mentioned the idea of gaining more control over your smoking, which you think could be beneficial, even though it could be difficult. We've also talked about the possibility of reducing the number of times you smoke each day as a step toward achieving that balance. Your openness and readiness to reflect on this are truly admirable. 

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
673342c18cfb6ee99257a7b5,client,No
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,Thank you for joining me today. I'm interested in hearing more about how smoking fits into your life right now. Can you tell me about that?
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,"To be honest, it's been a real challenge. I've been smoking for a while, and it's hard to break the habit."
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,You're finding it difficult to let go of something that's been a part of your life for some time.
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,"It's like my brain is wired to associate smoking with relaxation or stress relief. Even though I know it's not good for me, it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm giving up something that's been"
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,"Smoking provides you with a sense of relaxation and stress relief, yet you're aware it's not beneficial to your health."
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,Indeed! that is why i am working hard to quit it
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,What kinds of things have you noticed about trying to quit and the effort you're putting in?
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,"One thing I've noticed is that it's the little things that can trigger a craving. Like, I'll be driving in my car and suddenly I'll reach for the pack of cigarettes that's not even there anymore."
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,"You've put effort into removing the cigarettes from your life, but old habits still pop up unexpectedly."
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,Yes
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,It's really impressive that you're working hard to overcome those triggers and have removed cigarettes from your immediate reach. What have you found helpful in trying to manage those cravings so far?
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,"I have found that having a support system in place has been really helpful. I've told my friends and family about my decision to quit, and they've all been super supportive."
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,Having supportive friends and family makes a big difference in your journey to quit smoking.
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,Very well
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,Having a support system means a lot to you in handling those cravings.
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,Having people who care about me and want to see me succeed has made a huge difference.
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,"What are some other reasons or motivations driving you to quit smoking, beyond the support from your loved ones?"
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,"For me, one of the biggest motivations is the desire to improve my health. I've been smoking for a long time, and I've started to notice the effects it's having on my body."
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,"Although smoking has been a long-time habit, improving your health seems to hold greater significance for your future."
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,Yes
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,It's really commendable that you're prioritizing your health and recognizing the impact smoking has had on your body. That level of awareness and motivation is a strong foundation for making positive changes. What are some goals or aspirations you have related to your health and well-being that are motivating you to quit smoking?
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,client,"One of my biggest goals is to be able to run again without getting winded. I used to love running and hiking, but smoking has made it really difficult for me to do those things. I'd love to be able to"
667438545ae406d2678d37d1,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. We've covered quite a bit in our conversation. You've shared how challenging it can be to break the smoking habit, especially given its connection to relaxation and stress relief. Despite these challenges, you're actively working to quit, which is really commendable.

You've noted the importance of a strong support system from friends and family, which has been a big help for you. Improving your health is a major motivator, and you're determined to regain your ability to enjoy activities like running and hiking without being held back by smoking.

It's clear you have strong motivations and a supportive network backing your efforts. When you're ready, I'm here to continue supporting you on this journey.

Thank you again for your openness and time today. I look forward to our next session."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I’m curious, what role does smoking currently play in your life?"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"It is a very big part of my life, a major crutch"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"Like a trusty walking stick on a rocky path, there's a sense that smoking helps keep you steady when things get tough."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,Smoking is what I do when I'm stressed or bored.
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,What usually prompts you to reach for a cigarette when you feel stressed or bored?
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"Being used to smoking, it is what I am used to reaching for. When I feel like lashing out negatively, I smoke instead"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"Smoking has become an outlet for dealing with stress and boredom, yet there's a part of you that seems to question if turning to cigarettes is the best response to those feelings."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"I know it's not the best response. I also in my mind am ready to quit, but feel my body might be craving it, even when I am not mentally."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"There's a deep familiarity with the routine and the physical cravings can hold you back, yet in your mind, you're feeling ready for a change."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,Correct
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,What do you think could change for you in your life if you were to quit smoking?
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,I'd save a ton of money. I'd also be much less at risk for some kind of smoke related disease down the line.
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"Smoking feels like a financial burden and a health risk, but there's a vision of a healthier and more financially stable future if you're able to stop."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,Agreed
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,It's impressive to hear that you recognize the benefits of quitting and are mentally prepared to make that change. Your awareness and readiness are powerful allies in this journey. What do you think might help you align the mental readiness with overcoming those physical cravings?
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,Financial stability
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,Finding a way to keep your mind on the goal of financial stability could be a strong motivator in navigating the cravings.
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"I meant if I were more financially stable, I'd be less stressed, leading to a change in my want/need for cigarettes."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"You see financial stress as something that pushes you toward smoking, but there's a part of you that recognizes quitting could eventually relieve financial worries."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,I do not necessarily correlate the amount I'd save long-term with the immediate need for funds that would relieve my stressors short-term
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"You're navigating a complex situation where short-term needs conflict with long-term benefits, but you still hold the power to decide how both fit into your journey toward change. What sort of changes or strategies have you thought about to help manage stress or cravings outside of smoking?"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,I pray
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"Turning to prayer shows a desire for peace and a grounding force, suggesting you may have other inner resources to draw upon in times when you're feeling those cravings."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,Absolutely
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,What do you think it would look like to rely on prayer or other inner resources when stress levels start to rise?
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"I think it would look positively, but again, it is more my body than mindset"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"While your body craves the familiar comfort of smoking, there's a growing awareness of inner strength like prayer that might soothe these cravings and guide you toward change."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,Hasn't happened so far
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"There's a struggle with the physical dependency that sticks even when you try to lean on prayer, but a part of you still seeks positive outcomes."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,correct
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"You have the ability to choose how you respond to stress and cravings, and within you lies a capacity to explore different paths—even if it hasn't yet led to the change you desire. Where do you think you'd like to harness that capacity for change to align your actions with the mental readiness you've spoken about?"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"I have tried different path, none sticking thus far"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,What possibilities do you imagine could make a strategy stick for you now?
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"Not sure. I personally feel like if I could gain something like a car, it would allow me to get a job outside the home, where I could make the kind of money I needed to relieve my stressors"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"Imagining a new path opening up when gaining that freedom with a car, making it so you can reclaim the stability you seek."
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"If I could turn the thought into a reality, I'd be set"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,What steps do you think could transform that vision into reality?
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,This is where I'm stuck at. Everything comes back to money
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,What options do you see that could help you create a new avenue for financial stability while considering your current situation?
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,client,"Again, where I keep getting stuck at. My options are severly limited"
5fe354a2e44df4fb4634bbc3,counsellor,"Thank you for spending this time with me. We've reached the point where we should wrap up, so I'd like to summarize our conversation. You've shared that smoking feels like a significant part of your life, especially in times of stress and boredom, while acknowledging that you're mentally ready to quit despite the physical cravings you face. We explored the financial and health benefits of quitting and your vision for a different future, though you also expressed feeling stuck, especially regarding financial stressors playing a role in smoking habits. We discussed the potential of drawing on inner resources such as prayer, but also recognized that financial stability, such as acquiring a car, could enhance your options and relieve stress. Although we've explored possible strategies and supports, the challenge seems to lie in finding ways to transform these ideas into actionable steps, especially with the financial constraints. Please feel free to reach out anytime for further support, and thank you again for this opportunity to talk things through."

5c03975936230300012948ba,client,I am 61 years old and I started smoking when I was 14 years old. I really enjoy smoking. In the past four years I have gone from smoking about 30 cigarettes a day to 10 a day.
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"You've enjoyed smoking for many years, though recently you've made a significant reduction in how much you smoke."
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,Yes but I feel I'm stuck at 10 and can't go lower.
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"You've made impressive progress by cutting down to 10, yet it feels challenging to go any lower, suggesting that part of you is interested in further reducing your smoking."
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,yes. I'm not sure I want to quit completely. I have depended on smoking for a long time.
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"What has it been like for you to depend on smoking for so long, and what thoughts do you have about making changes?"
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,It hasn't been bad for me. I don't have a cough or anything and I can still be active. The worse thing is the rising cost and the societies attitudes have changed about smoking.
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"You haven't experienced negative health effects from smoking, and there's a significant cost and social change that makes you wonder about further cutting down."
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,Yes. Do you have any suggestions?
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"Is it okay if we explore your thoughts and feelings about changes you're considering before diving into potential strategies? That way, I can understand your goals better."
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,As I said I would like to reduce the amount I smoke from ten to five. I don't have a lot of thoughts about my smoking it is just part of who I am. Do you have any specific questions for me?
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"You're the one who really understands your smoking habits and how they fit into your life, which means you're in the best position to explore how reducing from ten to five might work for you. What are some thoughts or strategies you've considered that might help you in reducing from ten cigarettes a day to five?"
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,Well I smoke ten times a day so I would have to cut out cetain smoke breaks during the day. I could start by trying not to smoke when I first get up.
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"You're considering a practical approach by trying to skip your first smoke in the morning, which shows that you're already thinking creatively about how to reduce further."
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,Also going for an hour without smoking after meals.
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"Those are insightful ideas that could help you reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke each day, and it's admirable that you're willing to experiment with different strategies."
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,"Yes, well that is what has gotten me down to ten. I just have to look for times to cut more cigarettes out."
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"What has helped you successfully cut down to ten a day, and how do you see those strategies working for you as you aim for five?"
5c03975936230300012948ba,client,One thing is I try to go for a couple of hours without smoking and then instead on smoking I eat a meal. That can drag it out to more than three hours.
5c03975936230300012948ba,counsellor,"Thanks so much for sharing your journey with me today. We've reached the end of our time together, so let's go over what we've discussed.

You reflected on how smoking has been integrated into your life since you were 14, and you've made significant progress by reducing from 30 cigarettes a day to 10. We explored your feelings of enjoyment and reliance on smoking, alongside some contemplations about further reducing your intake due to costs and social changes. 

You shared intentions to cut down further to five cigarettes a day, acknowledging the strategies that have served you well so far—such as skipping the first cigarette of the day, extending time without smoking after meals, and deliberately stretching out the time between cigarettes by eating meals instead. 

Your thoughtful approach and willingness to try new ideas stood out, and it sounds like you've been patient and creative with the reductions you've already made. If and when you're ready to discuss more, or if anything new comes up, I'm here to support you. Thank you again for coming in and sharing your experiences."

5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,client,I smoke roll ups but I can go for periods of time without a cigarette. I never intended to smoke for this long and am worried about my health.
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"You're able to go without a cigarette for some time, and you are also concerned about the impact of smoking on your health, which seems to be motivating a desire for change."

5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"Although smoking has been a part of your routine, both the effect on your health and the financial burden are nudging you towards thinking about making a change."
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,client,yes
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"Recognizing the importance of your health and finances shows a lot of self-awareness and determination, both valuable traits when considering change.

5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"You're apprehensive about the difficulties of quitting, yet the motivation to improve your health and finances is strong and compelling."

5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,client,the physical habit of rolling the cigarette
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"When you think about the physical habit of rolling a cigarette, what makes that particular routine challenging to give up for you?"
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,client,"because its a habit that keeps y fingers busy, its almost like a soothing ritual"
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"Rolling and smoking cigarettes is like a comforting dance, offering a sense of calm and keeping your hands engaged at the same time."
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,client,yes

5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,Would it be okay if we explored some additional strategies together that might aid in reducing your smoking?

5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"When the urge to roll a cigarette hits, trying activities like taking a short walk, doodling, or even squeezing a stress ball could provide an engaging alternative."

5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,counsellor,"Thank you for having this conversation with me today. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far. You're currently using roll-up cigarettes and have been worried about the impact on your health and finances, which has encouraged you to think about making a change. While the ritual of rolling provides comfort and keeps your hands busy, you’re considering steps like delaying your first cigarette by doing yoga and drinking more water to possibly reduce your smoking. These small steps speak to your determination to move towards a healthier lifestyle, despite feeling some excitement, apprehension, fear, and hope about the future. Remember, these emotions are natural in the process of change. Keep those strategies in mind moving forward, they seem like positive alternatives and stepping stones to support you on this path.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
5aae93f5fb22320001baaaac,client,No
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I'm curious to know, what got you thinking about your smoking habits recently?"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"I've thought about it on and off for a while and to be honest it's mostly the expense. But I've found ""under the counter"" tobacco and have been buying that considerably cheaper"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"The cost of smoking has been a big concern for you, and buying cheaper tobacco has been a temporary solution."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"Hopefully more than temporary, but yes likely temporary"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"You've found a temporary way to manage the cost, but the thought that this might not last is on your mind, leaving room for you to explore other reasons you might be considering change."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"Health reasons of course are always considered, but I'm already chronically ill and cigarettes are one of the only things I enjoy when I'm in pain. So it's hard to give that up"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"Tell me more about how smoking fits into your life, especially when you're dealing with chronic pain."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"It takes my mind off things a little, gives me something to focus on, releases dopamine. So I can find myself smoking more when sore"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"Smoking is one of the few things that bring you comfort and relief in your daily life, but you also recognize the health concerns it can bring."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"Yes. I also have ADHD and autism, so the dopamine from smoking is one of the only legal sources. I'm seeing a psych soon and hopefully getting stimulant medication which might help smoking less"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"Smoking feels like a useful coping mechanism for managing pain and symptoms related to your ADHD and autism, yet you're hopeful that getting stimulant medication soon might bring additional support for smoking less."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"Yes, I'm hoping so, that the stimulant fills the dopamine gap"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,How do you envision your life might change once you start the stimulant medication?
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"Being more productive even when sore, hopefully at least. Which I'll be able to move around and keep focused on something other than pain and smoking"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"You're imagining a future where the medication could help you stay active and focused, allowing you to divert attention from pain and smoking towards more positive activities."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,Yes
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"It's impressive how you're actively seeking ways to improve your well-being, even with everything you're managing. It takes strength and determination to look for and consider new solutions like the medication. What other steps have you considered taking, along with seeing a psych, to support your journey in smoking less?"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,Seeing a rheumatologist for my chronic pain to also cut down pain which I see as a reason I smoke
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,You're taking proactive steps to manage both your pain and your smoking by seeking help from different specialists.
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"I feel I know what the root cause is, so I'm taking steps to address it from that perspective. If I try and cold turkey or other cessation methods then it might cause problems elsewhere like with mood"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"You're cautious about quitting suddenly because you recognize that smoking has been a way to manage your mood and pain, yet you're determined to address these underlying issues through medical support."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,Yes
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"What has been most helpful in managing your smoking so far, apart from the avenues you're exploring with medical support?"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"Nothing really. I tried exercise but it turns out I really crave and like smoking after a run which is weird, but my body is strange"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"You're exploring different ways to handle smoking, even when your body reacts unpredictably. It shows that you've got the determination and ability to keep searching for what might work best for you. What other support or resources have you thought about exploring that could help with smoking less as you get more information about your health?"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"In years past I've tried nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and e-cigarettes but they all made me want to smoke more. I've had a look at the australian QUIT line but they don't help"

583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,Only that stimulants and/or other treatments for ADHD/Autism/Chronic pain combined with exercise and accomplishing other goals may be effective. First I have to get through the gauntlet of doctors

583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,counsellor,"...so you hope that by being more proactive, it will guide you toward quitting smoking and achieving the control you seek."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,client,"Yeah, from a physiological sense the craving for nicotine is enhanced by the adhd lack of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and stimulants may let me have more control. Same with chronic pain mgmt"

65713343f1cd4911a5327687,client,Moving out of my sister's home so I'm no longer living with a smoker

647d380660e059e1612303e8,client,I know I need to quit even though smoking is how I handle stress. I just give in after about 24 hours because cravings get bad or I have to drive a long time.

647d380660e059e1612303e8,client,I just said I don't want to gain weight eating every craving.

647d380660e059e1612303e8,counsellor,"When you focus on your breathing during a craving, it might not only help calm your mind but also create some space between the urge and your response."
647d380660e059e1612303e8,client,That sounds good and reasonable. What else can you recommend?
647d380660e059e1612303e8,counsellor,Focusing on activities that engage your mind or body might not lead to weight gain and can offer a way to tackle cravings with a proactive response.

6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I'm really glad we can chat. To get us started, could you share a bit about your relationship with smoking? What role does it play in your life right now?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,I mainly smoke because im an anxious person and i feel like its a releasew to have a smoke
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"So smoking has become a kind of safety net for you, a way to manage those anxious feelings and find a bit of comfort."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah exactly, i started smoking at work mainly because i could go on a break outside and have a smoke and it got me out and talking to people and eleviated a bit of anxiety for me"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,Taking a break to smoke at work has given you a chance to connect with others and ease some of that stress you feel.
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah and now i've made it a habit, even bought a vape and i sometimes smoke whilst im working now so its getting worse"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,Tell me about how smoking while working affects you. What impact do you think it's having on different parts of your life?
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"I think it makes me more anxious, i find myself shaking my leg a lot more ect whilst im sat at my desk"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Smoking helps you to manage your anxiety and form connections at work, but it also seems to increase your nervousness in other ways, like making you more restless."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah exactly, that aspect of it i don't like at all."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Smoking provides a way to alleviate your anxiety and make social connections, but it's also causing more restlessness and discomfort at work, which isn't something you want to continue experiencing."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,There is that but i feel like im an anxious person anyway and i will do them things regardless
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,What are some things besides smoking that help you when you're feeling anxious?
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,Honestly im not sure
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,Finding other ways to cope with anxiety is something you're still exploring.
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah, i'm not sure of options to consider."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Would you like me to share some ideas on other ways to manage anxiety, or would you prefer to talk a bit more about your experience with smoking first?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Please do, what idea's do you have?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"One idea is to consider breathing exercises, which many people find helpful for calming anxiety. Would you be interested in exploring this as an option?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"I've tried those before but the anxiety just comes right back, just tried some deep breathing and 2 minutes later my legs are shaking or im fidgeting."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"So smoking is one of the few things that seems to stick, and maybe it feels like there's not much else that really helps calm you for long."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah but even smoking doesn't help that much, it's just temporary but it makes it worse after that."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"While smoking gives you a short break from anxiety, it's clear that it doesn't provide a lasting solution, and you're starting to think about finding a way to improve things more permanently."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah exactly, i need to find another solution."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,Would it be helpful if we worked together to explore some other ways that might help you manage your anxiety without relying on smoking?
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah lets do it, if i had to hazard a guess its that i need to find the deep route of my anxiety. Could be something as simple as a lack of sleep causing an increase in anxiety"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"You're identifying that digging deeper into your anxiety and understanding its root, perhaps even something as simple as sleep, could offer a more lasting solution beyond smoking."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,Yeah i think sleep would be the main thing to tackle.
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,Addressing your sleep patterns could be a key step toward reducing anxiety and ultimately feeling less dependent on smoking. Would you be open to exploring some strategies for improving sleep habits?
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah i think your right, what suggestions do you have?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"When exploring healthy sleep habits, it can be really beneficial to create a consistent bedtime routine. Would you like to hear more about how small changes like this might help?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,Yeah i need to do that but actually stick to it
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,Studies show that going to bed and waking up at the same time each day can help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle and improve the quality of sleep.
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,Yeah i need to start setting a solid bedtime and making sure i'm getting those 8 hours. I think that would eleviate a lot of anxiety and be a good start atleast.
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Finding a steady bedtime routine could be a strong start toward lowering your anxiety, helping you feel more even throughout the day, and supporting the other changes you're looking to make in your life. If you're ready, we can work out some steps to make this plan doable for you."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Yeah that would be good, lets make a plan."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Before we dive into planning, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about first?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"Nothing i can think of, if there is i'll let you know as we go on."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"You've really opened up about how smoking affects your anxiety, and you've identified that improving your sleep could be a key step forward. Let's see if we can lay out a plan to help you start building a more consistent bedtime routine to support this goal. Would you like to explore some steps together to get started?"
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,Yeah lets do it
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Let's work on creating a bedtime routine that feels doable for you by setting specific goals and steps, focusing on when you'll head to bed and wake up, along with the types of activities that help you wind down."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"That's a great idea, i'll work on creating that."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Implementing this new bedtime routine might take some time to get used to, but sticking with it could be a significant move toward reducing your anxiety and feeling better overall."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,"I think your right, i will take your suggestions onboard."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"As you work on creating your bedtime routine, we can continue to explore how these changes affect your anxiety and the role smoking plays in your life."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,Yeah that would be helpful
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Creating a new routine might be challenging at first, but prioritizing a healthy sleep schedule could really help you manage anxiety and make the changes you want, without needing to rely on smoking so much."
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,client,Yeah but im ready to make the changes
6543b00f4a967d85ec9dd4cc,counsellor,"Thank you for your time today. I appreciate everything you've shared, and I recognize that our conversation has reached its intended length. To recap, we discussed your experience with smoking mainly as a way to manage anxiety, although you've noticed that it sometimes increases your restlessness. You mentioned that your anxiety extends beyond smoking, with smoking offering temporary relief that leads to further discomfort. 

We explored the idea of uncovering the root of your anxiety, where you suggested that a lack of quality sleep might play a role. From there, we talked about building a consistent bedtime routine, starting with setting a solid bedtime and aiming for eight hours of restful sleep.

665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,Thank you for being here. I'm glad we have some time to talk. Can you share with me what smoking means for you in your daily life?
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,I only smoke on the evenings when it gets dark. It is something for me to do to wind down. It's like someone having an alcoholic drink as a wind down but for me it's smoking instead.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"Smoking helps you unwind and relax, especially in the evenings."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Yes it does.

665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,What's it like for you when you think about your smoking habit and how it fits into your life?
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,"It doesn't really affect my life too much negatively, apart from the potential health concerns. I am not controlled by it."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"Although smoking doesn't seem to have a strong hold on you, those health concerns still linger in the back of your mind."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Yes they do. But I am a relatively light smoker.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"You feel you're not heavily dependent on smoking, yet those health worries still weigh on your mind."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Yes.

665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"Smoking provides a way for you to unwind at night, but those thoughts about cancer show that health is something you truly value."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,"I guess I do, yes."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"Those health concerns highlight a desire within you to prioritize your well-being, indicating the importance of health in your life choices."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Yes.

665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,I think that I am putting my body under unnecessary stress. To a point I am betraying my body.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"As if you've been letting your body down, and you're ready to take better care of it."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Yes.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,It's really admirable that you're so aware of your body's needs and are thinking about taking steps to protect it.  What thoughts have you had about how you might protect your body and well-being moving forward?
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,By stopping smoking as a first point of call. Then to sort my diet out and exercise more often.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,What would it mean for you to start taking steps towards these health changes you've been thinking about?
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,"It would mean so much. I value feeling mentally and physically good everyday, not sluggish, tired and not-happy as I am feeling most days recently."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"What changes do you imagine experiencing in your daily life, both physically and mentally, if you were free from smoking?"
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,I would have more energy. And I would feel less anxious.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"You're envisioning a future where letting go of smoking leads to more energy and less anxiety, showing the significance of good mental and physical health in your life."

665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"You're not quite ready to make changes today, but moving closer feels very important for your well-being and satisfaction in life."
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Yes.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,We’ve talked about how smoking fits into your life and your thoughts on possibly changing it for better energy and less anxiety. Is there anything else you'd like to explore or discuss today before we think about potential ways forward?

665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Thank you.
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's go over what we talked about. Smoking in the evenings has become a way for you to unwind, like others might with an evening drink. While it doesn't dominate your life, you’re mindful of potential health issues, like lung or throat cancer, which have been causing some concern. These worries show how much you value your health and your body, and it's clear you're considering ways to honor that value. You also shared that you'd love to experience more energy and less anxiety—benefits you associate with reducing or quitting smoking. Though you're not ready to change just yet, you're planning to move toward this change soon, prioritizing feeling mentally and physically better in your day-to-day life. I'm here whenever you decide to take those next steps. Take care.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,client,Thank you!
665cd22930e667143ec243a5,counsellor,"Thank you for our conversation today. Let's summarize what we have discussed. Smoking in the evenings acts as a way for you to wind down, similar to how others might use an evening drink.

636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,"What does smoking mean to you right now, and how does it fit into your life?"
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,It means relaxation and time to myself. I have a flexible work and social schedule so smoking fits in fine. I have time to take cigarette breaks.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,Tell me about any other feelings or experiences you have regarding smoking that stand out to you.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,It actually is a social thing. Strangers cast outside because they smoke form bonds.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,It sounds like smoking has become a way to form connections with others during those shared moments outside.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,Smokers get shunned by society now. They same society that made smoking cool.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,"You feel isolated because society's views have changed, although smoking has these social links for you, you're thinking about the ways it can connect rather than isolate you overall."
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,Yes i feel more connected to smokers than those who shun people because of the habit.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,"You appreciate the connections you can make with other smokers, even when feeling distanced from those who disapprove of the habit."
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,Yes i do

636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,"Smoking feels like a way to find calmness and balance, yet perhaps there's a part of you that wonders if there are other or additional ways to achieve that relaxation."
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,"Of course there are other ways, but i havent found any as fulfilling"
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,"Smoking gives you a sense of fulfillment and relaxation, yet you're not dismissing the possibility of exploring other paths to that same feeling."
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,"of course there are other ways, but I yet to find any as fulfilling."
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,What would you say are some of the most fulfilling aspects of smoking that you've experienced?
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,smoking relaxes me and reduces anxiety.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,"Smoking helps you manage anxiety and find relaxation, yet you have a curiosity about discovering other fulfilling ways to achieve that feeling; you're exploring how this might fit into your life."
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,Are you trying to hypnotize me?
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,You're cautious about feeling persuaded or altered in any way.
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,Are you trying to hypnotize me?

636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,counsellor,"Quitting might not be in your plans right now, yet there's also a part of you that allowed for the idea of participating in a study about smoking."
636173dce29cfc5dbc14d0f2,client,"I dont plan on quitting, so the money is the only benefit for me."

5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. I'm interested in hearing about your experience with smoking. Could you tell me a bit about your relationship with it?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I've smoked for a long time - maybe 15 years. I stopped for 2 years about 8 years ok but started again. I like smoking but don't like the smell and I worry about my health
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"You enjoy smoking and it's been a long-time habit for you, although you're concerned about the negative effects, like the smell and potential health risks that come with it."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,yes
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,It's great to see that you're reflecting on your habits and thinking about your health. Recognizing those concerns shows that you care about yourself and your well-being. What was it like for you during those 2 years when you stopped smoking?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,"It felt weird being a non-smoker but slowly I didn't;t reach for cigarettes any more. I started again after being out clubbing and smoking with friends, and fell straight back into it"
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Smoking with your friends brought back that old habit, even though you had managed to break free from reaching for cigarettes before that moment."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,exactly
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Being part of social situations, like clubbing, drew you back to smoking with your friends, yet you also experienced a time when you didn't feel the need to smoke over those two years, and that change was significant for you."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,that is very true
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,Tell me more about what motivated you to quit smoking for those two years.
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I read the Allan Carr stop smoking book. It was really easy to quit. I thought I could go back to it and quit again but it hasn't worked again
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"You found it straightforward to quit with the book before, but picking up smoking again hasn't been as manageable to stop the second time, leaving you considering the idea that maybe there's another way forward."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,but I don't know what it would be
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"And finding another way could make quitting achievable again, much like it was the first time with the book."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I hope so
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,What do you think would be different if you were to quit smoking again?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I would know that I couldn't ever start again. I don'y want to be back in this situation again
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"You're realizing now that if you quit, it needs to be a permanent change, and you're determined not to find yourself in this situation again."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,precisely
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Committing to quitting once more suggests a readiness for a different path, indicating how much you value sustaining freedom from smoking for good."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I do value it
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,What are the most important things for you as you think about making this lasting change?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,"dealing with cravings - not just physical though, just situational too"
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,Describe how managing those cravings might look for you in different situations.
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,It is a feeling of loss every time I go to smoke and realise I can;t
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,Facing that feeling of loss when you decide not to smoke shows how much the habit is intertwined with different parts of your life.
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,yes and that is what I struggle with
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,What steps do you think you could take to cope with those feelings of loss in moments when you consider smoking?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,remembering why I am doing it maybe?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,Keeping reminders of your reasons for making this change could serve as a powerful motivator when those hard feelings arise.
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,yes that is truew
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,It's impressive that you're thinking about using your motivations to stay focused on making this change and understanding your own needs through this process. What would a smoke-free future bring to your life that you don't have now?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,"I wouldn't be worried about whether I smell, and whether I am doing lasting damage to my health"
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,You'd gain the peace of mind knowing you're taking control of your health and how you present yourself to the world.
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,that is very true
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,How do you see yourself making this positive step towards not smoking again?
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I really don't know. I'm almost scared when I think of it
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Part of you feels scared about facing life without smoking, but there's also a strong desire to move past the worries about smell and health, and seeking a way forward that aligns with your goals."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,yes I am not working towards my goals at all
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Not working toward your goals is frustrating, yet you're also aware of the steps you need to take to start moving in that direction, even though there's fear involved in getting there."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,yes
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"It's clear that you're really thoughtful about this process and willing to explore your feelings, which can be very powerful in working towards your goals. What would it mean for you personally to align more closely with your goals moving forward?"
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I feel agitated when I think about how I am doing something that is unhelpful for me. I feel like I cannot stop but I know I must
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Part of you feels trapped by the agitation of doing something unhelpful, but you also recognize the need to stop and move forward toward your goals."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,yes
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"You're feeling stuck and weighed down by agitation when you think about smoking, but there's a deep determination underneath to stop because you know it's necessary for your well-being."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I'm not sure how deep my determination is. And then I think I should just carry on smoking
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Describe how you envision your life if you were to continue smoking, versus the life you want to lead."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,"In a constant cycle of worry about what it is doing to me, then thinking it's fine. Versus being sad about not smoking but knowing it is better for me"
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"You're torn between the comfort of not making a change and the need to be free from worry about your health, acknowledging that giving up smoking could lead to a better life for you in the long run."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,yes precisely
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Part of you finds some comfort in continuing with your smoking habit, but you are more focused on the relief and peace of mind that quitting would ultimately bring you."
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,client,I hope that I can find that focus
5d092c1f7dad2200193be669,counsellor,"Thank you for talking with me today. We've reached the end of our time for now, but let's take a moment to reflect on what we've discussed.

We've touched on the challenges smoking presents, like its constant presence, yet you're proactive in seeking counseling as a first step.

65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm curious to hear what your experience with smoking is like for you. What can you share about your relationship with smoking?
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,I began smoking around the age of 18. I was in college and it was stressful so I figured that I would try it and see if it would help my situation.
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,Tell me more about how smoking fit into your life back then and what your feelings are about it now.
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,It helped me relieve stress and I figured I could stop when I wanted to. I didn't really think it affected my life any sort of way back then. I did stop smoking once for a year which was brought on by
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,"So there was a time when smoking felt like a helpful stress reliever for you, yet you did manage to stop for a year. That shows you're capable of quitting when needed, even if it seemed manageable at first."
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,I stopped for a year at the request of my ex-girlfriend. I knew she did not appreciate the smell nor taste when we would kiss. She is the reason I stopped. After we separated I began smoking again
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,"Your relationship with smoking changed based on your relationship with your ex-girlfriend, but that also shows that you're willing to make changes for things that really matter to you."
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,Well I only stopped for her. Truthfully I do not have a desire to stop. I do not perceive it as having a negative effect on me.
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,What is it about smoking that you feel benefits you or fits into your life without causing any negative effects?
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,I am aware of the negative effects but i just block them out. Smoking gives me a little break to sort of just catch up with everything going on.
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,"Catching a break through smoking helps you deal with the busy parts of life, yet you are aware of the potential negative effects."
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,Yes that is correct. I have an uncle who has smoked since he was 8 years old and now he is over 60. I see how it has affected his health so i am aware of the consequences.
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,"Seeing your uncle's health gives you a clear understanding of smoking's long-term effects, yet for now, you see it as a way to take necessary breaks in your busy life."
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,"For the most part yes. I use it as a way to have time to process everything going on, both physically and mentally. My mind is often very scattered and I dwell on things that i shouldn't."
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,What are some of the things you notice yourself dwelling on during those smoking breaks?
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,I often dwell on my past relationships and my most recent ex-girlfriend. I cannot get past the feelings i still have for her. I try not to think about her but she never leaves my mind
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,"Like you're trapped in a cycle of thoughts and feelings about her, and smoking acts as a pause button."
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,client,"Yes. I feel guilty and i know its bad to smoke and drink and do other things but thats the only way i can find some sort of peace, even if only for a fleeting moment."
65f1c7433ac03db765292e1d,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing with me today. We've covered quite a bit, and I want to take a moment to summarize our conversation.

You shared how smoking started as a way to relieve stress during your college years and how you managed to quit for a while at your ex-girlfriend's request. It signifies you have the ability to change for what matters to you.

Your uncle's health has made you aware of smoking's potential long-term effects, which weigh on your mind though you're currently using smoking to cope with the mental scatteredness and feelings tied to past relationships, particularly your feelings for your ex-girlfriend. 

Through it all, you mentioned that smoking offers a temporary pause amidst these reflections and feelings, even while you're aware of the broader consequences.

I appreciate your openness and the insights you've shared. When you're ready to explore any changes regarding this, we can discuss more options to support you. Feel free to reach out when you're ready, and take care."
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. To start off, I’d like to understand more about your current relationship with smoking. Can you tell me a bit about how smoking fits into your life right now?"
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,"I have been smoking consistently for a very long time. Minimum a day. I vape as well. Smoking generally keeps me focused, relaxed and calms my nerves."
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"Smoking serves as a way for you to focus, relax, and calm your nerves."

66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"Smoking and vaping play an important role in helping you unwind and stay focused, yet there might be moments where they could interfere with other areas of your life."
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,Yes that's correct
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,What are some of the ways smoking and vaping might hold you back or create challenges for you?
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,Sometimes I think of the potential health risks associated with smoking. The main triggers are health talk shows and discussions on the downsides of smoking
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,What goes through your mind when you hear about these health risks on talk shows and discussions?
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,I become uncomfortable a d struggle to shake off the potential downsides to smoking. The reality bugs me for a few hours afterwards
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"Smoking helps you manage stress and stay focused, but the awareness of potential health risks lingers in your mind after being confronted with information."
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,That's correct
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"You hold a powerful understanding of the risks associated with smoking, and it sounds like you have the ability to consider how this information fits into your life and potentially make a change if and when you choose to. How do you envision your life being different if you were to consider cutting back or quitting smoking entirely?"
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,I foresee an initial struggle because i have done it for a long time but i see myself happy if i can at least cut back on smoking
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"You may face a challenge in the beginning because smoking has been a long-standing part of your routine, but the idea of cutting back brings a sense of happiness and hope for a healthier lifestyle."
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,yes
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"Quitting feels daunting because it's been a long part of your life, but the thought of cutting back gives you hope for happiness and a healthier future."
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,sure
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,What are some of the things you think would help you move forward on this path toward cutting back on smoking?
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,I have contemplated going for therapy in time past but never went ahead with it. I may have to get professional help at some point
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,What steps do you think you could take to explore the option of getting professional help and how do you feel about it?
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,client,"Seeking the help of a therapist, attend some sessions and see the way forward, i have good feelings about this only that i haven't gone ahead with it yet."
66ec69d204145257feb0cd33,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. Our conversation has reached its intended length, so I'd like to summarize what we've discussed. We explored how smoking and vaping play a significant role in your life by helping you relax and focus. At the same time, we've recognized that you feel concern when faced with information about the health risks, and it leaves you contemplating the potential downsides. You envision a path where cutting back might bring you happiness and hope for better health. We also discussed the possibility of seeking professional help, which you feel positive about, even though you haven't pursued it yet. If you decide to continue exploring this route, you might consider scheduling therapy sessions to find the support you need.

57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,Tell me more about what it's like for you when you're around people and feeling that unpredictability.
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,"It make me feel uneasy, nervous. Knowing people can act maliciously without much reasoning is kind of scary."

57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,Yes.
57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,Feeling uneasy and nervous around people is a lot to handle.
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,"It really is, using a vice helps soothe the stress a little."
57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,"When you've been feeling stressed and turned to smoking for relief, what has that experience been like for you?"
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,"Short term it helps relieve the urgent stress levels, but knowing how harmful smoking is worries me quite a bit."
57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,"Smoking provides you with short-term relief from stress, but the worry about its harmful effects is weighing on your mind even more."
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,That is correct.
57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,"Smoking helps ease your immediate stress, yet the worry about its harmful effects suggests there's a part of you that is concerned about your well-being and may be thinking about making a change."

57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,"What changes are you considering, and what would making those changes mean for you?"
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,"Either stopping smoking or at least cutting down. It would be hard to do, but in the long run it would give me peace of mind."
57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,"You're considering quitting or cutting back, even though it would be a challenge, because having peace of mind about your health in the long run is really valuable to you."

57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,"It's admirable that you're thinking about making a change for the sake of your long-term peace of mind. It shows your commitment and care for your well-being. When you think about what it would take to quit or cut down, what do you envision the process might look like for you?"
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,"It would involve having activities to take part in, when otherwise I would be smoking."
57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,"You've relied on smoking as a way to cope with stress and the unpredictability of people around you, but you're also looking at finding other activities to replace smoking so you can gain the peace of mind you're seeking."
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,Yes
57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,What activities do you think might help distract you from smoking and support this change you're considering?

57681fca8e454c000133a203,counsellor,...so you're starting to see how focusing on health through exercise and walking could help shift your mindset towards healthier habits in general.
57681fca8e454c000133a203,client,It is all a mental battle really isn't it. keeping temptations at bay to better myself. Be strong minded.

You shared how smoking helps you with managing stress and uneasiness, particularly around other people, providing you with short-term relief.

I appreciate your openness and clarity about wanting to make a positive change for yourself. If you'd like to continue this conversation at any point, I'm here to support you. Take care, and thank you again for our talk today."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. I'm really glad you've taken this step. To get us started, could you share a bit about your relationship with smoking?"
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,I have smoked for a long time. I am addicted. I enjoy it but know I should quit
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"You've been smoking for a long time and find enjoyment in it, yet there's a part of you that feels it's important to quit."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,Thats right
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"Smoking has been a part of your life for a long time, and there's enjoyment in it for you. However, you're also aware of the reasons for quitting, and that feeling is important to you too."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,Exactly. I know it is not good for me
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,Tell me more about what has led you to consider quitting smoking.
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,"Well it is expensive, it is not pleasant for others around me and it is bad for my own health"
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"And at the same time, continuing to smoke means you're not only acknowledging those costs but also sacrificing savings, relationships, and personal well-being."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,That is true but the sacrifices have not convinced me to quit enough for me to do it yet
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"While the sacrifices haven't motivated you to quit yet, the awareness of those costs, particularly around health, money, and the impact on others, does keep this idea of quitting alive in your mind."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,Yes i think about it often and how not smoking would simplify my life as well - not needing to take breaks and make sure that i have cigarettes on hand
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,What kinds of changes do you think would happen in your daily life if you weren't smoking anymore?
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,I would sleep better and have more time to do other things
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,It's great to hear that you're thinking about how your life might improve without smoking; exploring those positives can be a valuable part of our conversation.
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,I have quit for extended periods in the past so i know I am able to do that
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"And your past experiences with quitting show just how capable you are, yet perhaps it's about finding the right moment or motivation to make that change permanent now."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,Yes that is part of the motivation for sure when I have a real desire to quit its more possible for me
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"While the desire to quit hasn't always been there, when the motivation is strong, you recognize that lasting change is more achievable."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,its more like when i have the motivation then the craving to smoke is more easy to push off
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,What kind of motivations do you think would make it easier for you to handle those cravings and stay smoke-free in the long run?
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,in the past it has been a serious personal relationship with someone else that made me want to do it enough
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"And the value this relationship held for you provided a motivation beyond your current circumstances, making it feel worthwhile to push through the cravings."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,that is correct
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"Your past relationships provided a strong motivation, but things are different now – perhaps you'd need a new type of motivation or support to guide you toward change."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,It is possible that could work
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,Can you share more about what kind of support or motivation you feel might work for you now?
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,I am not sure  - maybe I would just need to decide I was ready to do it for myself
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"Deciding to quit for yourself could be empowering, giving you control over your choices and letting them reflect your own needs and values rather than external influences."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,I agree but I don't feel like I am ready to do that just now
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"You might not feel ready just yet, but it seems that making this decision for yourself and on your own terms might hold more meaning when the time is right."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,yes - if i was truly committed then i think it would
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"When you think about being truly committed to quitting for yourself in the future, what do you envision that might look like?"
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,maybe coinciding with some other change in my life such as a move or a job change
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,What about those life changes feels like the right moment to consider quitting smoking?
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,it just feels like a time when i might break from old routines more easily
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,What do you think might help you stay focused on your goal to quit smoking during a big life change like a move or a new job?
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,when i quit before i started to think about the cravings of a cigarrette being an indication that i was breaking the addiction when i did not act on them
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,Thinking of those cravings as a sign of breaking free from chains could give you the power to push through and move towards a smoke-free life.
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,yes - that is how i felt
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"Breaking the addiction starts to feel like planting seeds for a new chapter, where each craving resisted is a step towards growth and change."
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,right - and of course over time they got weaker and futher apart
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,What might be different in your life after you've managed to move past those initial cravings and reach a more settled place without smoking?
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,client,it would be easier not worried about smoking and smelling like smoke
6650a38d75c08f70233642b1,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and time with me today. We've reached the end of our session, so let's take a moment to reflect on what we've talked about.

We began by exploring your long-standing relationship with smoking, recognizing both the enjoyment it brings you and the costs you're aware of, such as health concerns, financial expenses, and its impact on your surroundings. Despite these sacrifices, the idea of simplifying your life and the recognition that you've managed to quit for extended periods in the past continue to linger.

We also delved into the motivations that have supported you in the past, such as significant personal relationships, and the possibility of new life changes, like a move or a job change, providing you an opportunity to break from old routines.

Currently, you're considering a future where quitting is a decision you make for yourself. Imagining what life might look like smoke-free—easier, less worried, and without the smell of smoke—presents an attractive vision for positive change.

You've thought about quitting to improve your health for exercise and see benefits like financial savings, which could open up more opportunities for enjoyment and new hobbies. While there's a concern about relapse, you've considered that setting achievable targets may help navigate this. This awareness, along with your motivations, creates a foundation for change. If you feel ready, we can explore planning next steps together, or you're always welcome to return whenever you're ready.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"

5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Thanks for deciding to talk with me today. I'm curious to hear about your experience with smoking. What role does it play in your life right now?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,just a habit and something to help relieve stress
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,What are some of the ways smoking helps you manage stress?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,because it takes me outside and makes me think about something else
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Taking a break and stepping outside helps shift your focus away from stress.
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,with a cigarette yes
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Taking a break with a cigarette gives you that moment of mental escape.
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"It's impressive that you've found a way to create that mental space for yourself, even if it's just for a moment. In what ways have you thought about managing stress without smoking?"
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,"I have tried just going outside but it doesn't work, I have tried sitting down with a book but again it doesn't work"
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,What else have you noticed about those attempts to cope without smoking?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,I feel more stressed throughout the day and seem to be more irratible
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,And that irritability makes it even harder to get through your day without reaching for a cigarette.
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"It's understandable that you're looking for alternatives, and it's commendable that you're trying out different ways to handle stress. Your willingness to explore these options shows your determination to find what's best for you. What are some moments when you've noticed that irritability is most challenging for you?"
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,when my son doesn't do as he's told I seem to get more irratible if I havent had a cigarette that day
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"Managing your stress without cigarettes makes you feel more irritable, especially in moments with your son, but you're still open to finding other ways to address it."
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes that's correct
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,How do you imagine things might look if you could manage stress and irritability in a way that feels good for you?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,i would be happier
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"Being happier for both yourself and being more present with the important people in your life, like your son."
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes I would like that
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Is there anything else you’d like to talk about before we explore ways to move toward that happier state you envision?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,no i don't think so
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"Before we dive into planning some steps forward, I'd like to summarize what we've discussed so far and then ask if you're open to exploring some options together. How does that sound to you?"
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes that's fine
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"Quitting smoking can lead to various benefits, like improved mood, better physical health, and increased energy levels."
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,I'd like to see those benefits
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Let's explore together some steps that can help you move toward experiencing those benefits. Would you be open to discussing some ideas that might work for you?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes I would
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"Let's brainstorm some practical and achievable steps you might take to manage stress better and feel happier without the need for smoking. Would you like to start with small changes, or explore some new stress-relief activities?"
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes I'd like to start wth some small changes
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Starting small can create a sense of progress and build your confidence toward those bigger goals.
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,but how would I do that
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"Would you like to try setting aside just a few minutes each day for a simple breathing exercise or a short walk without any distractions, and then see how it feels for you?"
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,how would that help me to quit
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Finding small ways to reduce stress could empower you to explore larger changes in quitting smoking over time.
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,oh ok
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"You’re putting in the effort to make meaningful changes, and knowing how to relieve stress without smoking can seem tricky at first, yet these small changes might become the roots for the deeper, lasting change you're hoping for."
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes I will try that
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,What are your thoughts on when and where you might start trying those small changes?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,just at home I might try the brething exercises
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,What do you hope to notice or experience when you try the breathing exercises at home?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,just try to relax more and hopefully not go out for as many cigarettes
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Exploring other ways to unwind without cigarettes will maximize relaxation benefits.
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,yes I will try that
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,Your commitment to trying new strategies for stress shows your dedication to creating a healthier environment for yourself and your son. Where do you see small changes fitting into your daily routine?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,I'm  not sure perhaps just throughout the day
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,How might you incorporate moments for breathing exercises into your daily routine to help reduce stress?
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,client,I don't know just when I can
5ae9cde00335e200019e9eed,counsellor,"Thank you for allowing me to engage with you today. We've reached the end of our session, so let's take a moment to reflect on what we've discussed. You've shared how smoking serves as a tool for stress relief and how stepping outside for a cigarette offers you a mental escape. Despite trying a few different methods to manage stress, you've found it challenging, and this has sometimes led to increased irritability, especially with your son. 

Together, we've explored handling stress without smoking and, specifically, the potential benefits this could have for your happiness and presence with your son. You identified small changes, like a few minutes of breathing exercises, fitting into your daily routine as an initial step you're willing to explore. 

I admire your readiness to consider ways to relax and reduce those cigarettes you rely on. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need support as you begin incorporating these practices into your life. Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to continuing our work together."

5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"You're recognizing the impact smoking has on both your health and your finances, and that's fueling your desire to quit."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,Yes
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,...and you're wanting to make a change but might be grappling with how to balance the challenges of quitting with maintaining your daily routine.

5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,Tell me more about how being around friends who smoke influences your efforts to quit.
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,I find it hard to say no or resist the urge when they do it in front of me
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"Being around friends who smoke makes quitting difficult, but you feel a strong desire for change for the sake of your health and finances."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,Yes

5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,What do you think might help you find more strength or support in your journey to quit smoking?
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,If it became less desirable
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"While it feels challenging now because smoking has become a habit fueled by social situations and a strong urge, you are looking for ways to reduce its hold on you and make a positive change."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,Yes how do I do that
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,Would it be okay if we talked about some strategies to make smoking less desirable for you?
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,Yes
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"You could try focusing on the benefits of a smoke-free life, like improved health and saving money, and think about how to remind yourself of these benefits when you’re around friends who are smoking."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,I do that but I cant hold back when I'm out drinking
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,What do you notice about your thoughts and feelings when you're out drinking and the urge to smoke becomes stronger?
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,I feel I dont care about the consequences as much and just want to have fun
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"Having fun and enjoying the moment feels important when you’re out drinking, but the consequences and your commitment to change still linger in your mind, nudging you toward a healthier lifestyle."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,Yes
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"When you're out and having fun, the urge to smoke might overshadow your goals for quitting, yet there's a part of you that deeply values the benefits of a smoke-free life and is keen to find a way to balance both."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,I just havent found the balance yet and i dont know how
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,In what ways could your social experiences still feel fulfilling and enjoyable without relying on smoking?
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,If I focused on the conversation with friends and catching up as opposed to my cravings
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"When you focus on the connection and conversation with friends, it gives you the opportunity to enjoy those moments in a new way, one that aligns with your goals for change."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,yes
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,In what other ways can you enjoy time with your friends that don't involve smoking?
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,Doing things during the day without drinking like the cinema or going to lunch
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,What might your time with friends look like if you incorporated more of these non-smoking activities into your routine?
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,I would be less distracted around them
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"...and be more present in the moment, enjoying their company without the distractions of smoking."
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,yes exactly

5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,I imagine it to be more peaceful
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,...and you might find a sense of calm and more genuine enjoyment with friends without the pull of smoking.
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,yes
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,Imagining a more peaceful and present social life shows your strong desire for positive change and a healthier way of engaging with your friends. That's an inspiring outlook. What are some other aspects of your life you imagine might change in a positive way if you quit smoking?
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,client,if I used the money spent on that on something else
5acb4bac9534ba0001c780aa,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts today; our conversation has reached its intended length. Let's go over what we've discussed. You've been smoking regularly for the past four years, which has brought feelings of shame and guilt, and you're motivated to quit for both your health and finances. We explored the challenges, especially when you're around friends who smoke, and the difficulty in staying firm against the urge, particularly while drinking. However, you've also recognized the potential for more fulfilling social experiences by focusing on meaningful connections with your friends and engaging in different activities, like going to the cinema or having lunch during the day. Imagining yourself smoke-free brings a sense of peace, both in your social life and your finances, envisioning how that money could be spent on things that bring you more satisfaction. It's evident that you have a strong desire for positive change, and finding balance is something you’re exploring actively.

Whenever you're ready to resume our conversation or take any next steps, I'll be here to support you further on this journey. Take care!"
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"Thank you for being here today. As we start, I’d love to hear a bit about your experiences with smoking. What got you into it, and how is it playing a role in your life right now?"
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,"I started smoking when I was 15, 25 years ago! Currently my smoking is just like breathing - just part of my normal , everyday life."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"I'm curious, what is it about smoking that has made it such an ingrained part of your life for so long?"
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,Because if I don't smoke I get super irritable and start coughing.
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"When you smoke, it prevents the irritability and coughing, yet part of you might also wonder what your daily life would be like if these were no longer issues and you didn't rely on smoking."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,True.
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing with me today. To summarize, we talked about how smoking has been a part of your life since you were 15, and how it's become a natural part of your daily routine. You mentioned that you smoke to avoid feeling irritable and experiencing coughing. At the same time, there's a part of you that wonders about the possibilities of not having to rely on smoking and how your life could change in that context. It's clear that smoking serves an important role for you right now, and our conversation helped explore some of these thoughts you have around it.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,"Yes, let's continue."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"Reflecting on what we've discussed, what changes about your daily life when you think about the possibility of not having those irritability and coughing issues, and not relying on smoking?"
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,"The fact that I would have a lot more money, and not feel like I have to smoke all the time."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"You're aware that smoking is a significant part of your routine, yet you're recognizing the benefits like saving money and not needing to smoke all the time if you stepped away from it."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,Yes!
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"It's great that you're open to thinking about the positive changes this might bring to your life. Recognizing these benefits shows a strong sense of self-awareness and a desire for a better quality of life. In thinking about your journey with smoking and what you've shared so far, what do you envision for yourself moving forward, in terms of your relationship with smoking?"
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,"Well, I am eventually going to have to quit, because I really don't want to die at like, age 60 due to cancer."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"You've come to depend on smoking as a way to ward off irritability and discomfort, but you're starting to see the potential health risks, like cancer, as a significant concern that motivates you to eventually want to quit."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,Correct.
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,Would it be alright with you if we explore your thoughts about what life might be like without smoking and any concerns or questions you have about making that change?
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,Sure
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,How do you see your life improving if you stopped smoking and addressed the coughing and irritability in other ways?
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,Life would definitely improve for me.
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"…living a life without smoking could bring you improved well-being, more financial freedom, and a sense of control over your health."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,Absolutely.
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"...so even though smoking has been such a constant part of your life, the idea of living longer, feeling healthier, and having more freedom feels more important now than hanging onto those moments with cigarettes."
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,True.
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,What steps do you think would be helpful for you to start moving toward this goal of quitting smoking and feeling healthier?
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,client,Cutting down the amount of cigarettes I smoke on a daily basis.
5a8f3dd5eea3d300016ece86,counsellor,"Thank you for your time today. We've reached our intended conversation length, so I'd like to summarize what we've discussed.

You've shared that smoking has been part of your life since you were 15, and although it's become an ingrained habit that helps you manage feelings of irritability and coughing, you're also aware of the significant health risks it brings. We explored the idea of what life might look like without smoking, and you recognized the potential to improve your well-being, save money, and gain a sense of freedom and control. You’re envisioning a future where quitting smoking allows you to avoid health issues like cancer and feel healthier overall.

As we discussed possible steps forward, you mentioned the idea of gradually reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke each day. This reflects your readiness to consider change, and it sounds like a great first step towards your goal of quitting.

61366ed1f850d20b1e3c62bb,client,"I have smoked for nearly 20 years, I did used to enjoy it more than I do now, but its affecting my health for sure"
61366ed1f850d20b1e3c62bb,counsellor,"You've been smoking for quite a long time and it used to bring you some level of enjoyment, but now you notice that it's having a negative impact on your health."

61366ed1f850d20b1e3c62bb,counsellor,"Smoking has been a big part of your life for a long time, and although it used to bring some enjoyment, you're now more aware of its effects on your health and are beginning to shift toward considering change."

61366ed1f850d20b1e3c62bb,counsellor,What are some of the ways smoking has impacted your health or other areas of your life?

61366ed1f850d20b1e3c62bb,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your experiences with me. We've reached the end of our conversation for today, so I'd like to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. You mentioned that you've been smoking for nearly 20 years. Originally, it brought some enjoyment, but now, you're noticing the significant impact it's having on your health, particularly affecting your lungs, and the financial burden it carries. These are important reflections, and they show a deeper consideration of how smoking fits into your life at present. If you'd like to talk about this further or explore possible changes, I'm here to support you. Thank you again for your openness and time today."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm curious to hear about what led you to start smoking and what your experience has been like with it over time. Can you share a bit about that with me?
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,I started smoking as a child when it was easy to purchase cigarettes. There was never the stigma attached to smoking as there is now. I have attempted to quit several times but failed.
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"You've experienced different attitudes towards smoking over time, and quitting has been challenging, but you have a part of you that's interested in trying to quit again."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,"That's true, but previous efforts have made me reluctant to try again"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"You're unsure about another attempt because of past experiences, although there's still a part of you that wants to quit smoking for good."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,Yes
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,What have been some of the biggest obstacles for you during those past attempts to quit?
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,"Habit. I tend to smoke at certain times such as after I have eaten, when I take a break or when drinking alcohol"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"And those times are when you feel a strong urge to smoke, but it also opens up an opportunity to consider new routines that might satisfy those habits differently."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,"That's true, but once that thought of smoking enters my head, there is only one outcome"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"The habit has a strong hold on you, especially with certain activities, but you acknowledge the potential for change if you can break those routines."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,I already know this but it doesn't make it any easier
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,Recognizing that struggle and wanting change despite it takes a lot of strength and self-awareness. What has kept you motivated to keep trying despite the challenges?
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,"To be honest, I have lost the motivation"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"Without motivation, it's even tougher to make a change."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,I know that
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"You may feel like you've lost the motivation, but you still took the step to come here today, showing that somewhere deep down, you have a desire to seek change."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,"Yes, but do you have any answers?"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"Would you be open to exploring, together, where you might find some renewed motivation or perhaps consider new approaches for change?"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,I'm open to exploring if you have any suggestions
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"If it's alright with you, we can look at small steps that might gradually build motivation. It doesn't have to be all or nothing."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,"Okay, where do you suggest I start?"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"Before we dive into planning, would you like to talk about anything else or are you ready to start thinking about how you might make a change?"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,"Nothing else, I'm here to listen to your suggestions"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"Seeking advice to find a starting point for change, although past attempts have left you without motivation."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,Yes
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"Would it be alright if we explore small, manageable changes you could try incorporating into your routines when you feel the urge to smoke?"
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,That's fine by me
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"You might consider trying to replace the habit of smoking with a different, quick activity, like taking a short walk or chewing gum, just to see how it feels."
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,client,I would consider taking a short walk
66dd8fbac0f23e86f02327c8,counsellor,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. We've reached the end of our conversation, and I want to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed.

You shared that you started smoking when attitudes towards it were different, and while you've attempted to quit several times, those attempts left you feeling hesitant to try again. You identified that habits like smoking after meals and during breaks make it challenging to quit. Even though motivation has been low, you took the step to come here, which suggests a part of you is still seeking change.

We explored the idea of looking for small, manageable changes, and you mentioned considering replacing some smoking moments with a short walk.

I appreciate your openness and willingness to explore new possibilities. We can always revisit these ideas and build on them further if you decide to continue this journey. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk more. Take care until we meet again."

You're envisioning a healthier, more peaceful future without the constant worry about your health, and have already thought about reducing your daily cigarette intake. Challenges like dealing with the urge to smoke are on your radar, yet you're considering strategies to manage them, such as not buying cigarettes and limiting exposure to other smokers. Physical activities like gaming, walking, and running serve as helpful distractions from smoking and also enhance your sense of well-being.

6708da9c62672d0fe65b6683,counsellor,"Although smoking brings a sense of relief during social situations or stress, part of you might be curious about what life could be like without it."

6708da9c62672d0fe65b6683,client,"taking up a hobby i enjoy, going out and seeing friends and family."
6708da9c62672d0fe65b6683,counsellor,"While reducing smoking, you're actually creating space for meaningful connections and discovering passions that bring you joy, giving you more to look forward to beyond cigarettes."

62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,Thank you for being open to having this conversation. I'm curious to hear more about what role smoking plays in your life right now. Would you like to share a bit about that?
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"Of course, what would you like to ask"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,What are some of the feelings or thoughts you have about smoking right now?
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"My feelings on it are 50/50, I'm beyond the thought of caring that it affects my health, however I'm more inclined when I'm involved with someone romantically and wanting to better myself."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"You don't really worry about the health impacts anymore, though being in a romantic relationship makes you think more about self-improvement."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,Why do I not need to worry about health impacts anymore?
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"While you're not overly concerned about the health impacts of smoking, you're open to considering change when a romantic relationship motivates you to focus on self-improvement."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"True, but what if I don't find that romantic relationship that could change things, I would be stuck still not caring"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"What do you think might help you care more about smoking and its impact, even if you're not in a relationship?"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,A wake up call from the Hospital saying I'll die if I dont stop in the next couple years.
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"A health scare could definitely be a wake-up call, but waiting for that might leave you feeling uncertain or stuck; you might find other motivating factors that aren't as severe."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"True, personally there is also another factor, but it involves changing my lifestyle and currently I find that difficult, I'd stop smoking if I can easily change my way of life and become healthier"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Changing your lifestyle feels really challenging at the moment, yet there's something about becoming healthier that seems important enough for you to consider stopping smoking if it were easier to achieve."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"True, personally there is also another factor, but it involves changing my lifestyle and currently I find that difficult, I'd stop smoking if I can easily change my way of life and become healthier"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,What does changing your lifestyle to become healthier look like for you?
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"To wake up, feel good, not rely on addictions, be happy and able to avoid temptation"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Although there's a struggle with relying on addictions and resisting temptation, the idea of waking up feeling good, being happy, and living without those dependencies really resonates with you."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"It does resonate, I tend to do this often however drinking and smoking are two things I wish I dident have in my life"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Quitting smoking and drinking might seem like giving up some comforts, but it could actually open up a path to that healthier, happier life you've been dreaming about."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"I guess, but that road seems like theres no light yet, feels like its just a jungle of thorns and vines. Its not that im afraid to take that road, I'm just not sure how to go about doing it"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Can you tell me more about what might help you start that journey, despite the thorns and vines you sense along the way?"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"I... Dont actually know what might help, paydays are dangerous for me. The moment I have money that I can expend easily I always choose the options of smoking and other addictions"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,What's been your experience with finding ways to manage spending when paydays trigger the urge to use smoking and other addictions?
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"Thats the thing, I dont manage it"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,What steps could you take to start managing spending differently on paydays?
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"Aside from stopping any impulses, I guess setting limits on my cards or somthing, but knowing me I'll find a way around it, especially on nights out where im drinking and craving a smoke"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Spending money impulsively, especially on paydays when you're out, makes it hard to avoid smoking and drinking. Though you know setting limits might help, there's a determination lurking in you to overcome these challenges to build the healthier life you envision."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,That determination is very easily broken sadly
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Your determination might waver at times, yet there's still a desire to create change and find a way around the patterns that hold you back."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"The feeling of quitting somthing for a while then coming back, just makes you feel like a failure. I feel this all the time, Its like a constant relapse"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"How does it feel when you come back to it, and where do you see that feeling leading you?"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"At first? It feels amazing, I love coming back to smoking and drinking, however its after... The more it becomes an addiction, when I try to tell myself its just this one time"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Relapsing into smoking and drinking initially feels refreshing and enjoyable to you, though over time, you feel the weight of addiction and telling yourself ""just this once"" seems never-ending."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,Exactly
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"On one hand, smoking and drinking immediately bring you enjoyment and relief, yet on the other, they're leaving you caught in a cycle where you struggle with telling yourself it'd be just this one additional time."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,"However I also think I may be potentially overreacting to the whole situation about it all. I know I'm capable, but I literally choose not too, this comes down to the fact I literally dont care"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"What would make you care, even just a little, about making a change?"
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,If I felt loved
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Like the ember of a cigarette, feeling loved could ignite the spark needed for change."
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,client,Yeah...
62d70d1f219a25bcf1db0bfa,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today and for being so open about what you're going through. As our conversation comes to a close, I'd like to go over what we've discussed.

You've shared that your feelings toward smoking and drinking are mixed, with a struggle between momentary enjoyment and the cycle of returning to old habits. Romantic relationships and a desire for healthier living present significant motivations for change, yet you grapple with a sense of not caring enough at the moment. We talked about how setting limits on spending might assist, alongside your thoughts on needing love to perhaps trigger a deeper concern for change.

Understanding this piqued motivation for self-improvement, which sometimes feels clouded by old habits, offers a foundation to build upon. Please keep in mind that progress is often not linear, and you're not alone in this journey.

5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'm curious to know what your relationship with smoking looks like at the moment. Could you share a bit about that with me?
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,Yes I smoke 5-10 cigarettes per day
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,What does smoking mean to you in your daily life?
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,it is important to relax and de-stress me.
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"And it might feel hard to imagine relaxing or de-stressing without it, which makes the idea of quitting quite intimidating."
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,"Yes, it is intimidating"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"When you're not smoking, how else do you like to find relaxation or deal with stress?"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,"I like to exercise, eat good food, hangout with friends, and spend time with family"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"You find comfort in smoking for relaxation and stress relief, but when you exercise, eat well, spend time with friends, and be with family, it shows you're open to other fulfilling ways of experiencing calm and enjoyment."
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,Yes that is true
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"Smoking provides a quick way to relax, but you also find deep relaxation and joy through exercise, good food, and close relationships."
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,I know
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,What are some of the reasons you've thought about cutting back or considering changes to your smoking habits?
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,"I have not really thought about it, because I enjoy smoking. I have thought about cutting back for financial reasons but none other than financial and health reasons"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"Smoking brings you enjoyment and helps manage stress, but cutting back could relieve some financial worries and support your health in the long run."
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,I.Know.
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,How do you feel about balancing the enjoyment you get from smoking with those financial and health reasons?
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,"I don't because I do not care for my health, but financial reasons are important to me, atleast in that regard."
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"You're considering the financial impact and recognizing that, when you're ready, you have the power to make choices in line with what's personally important to you, even if health isn't the current priority. In what ways have your thoughts about smoking shifted or evolved over time, especially when you consider financial reasons?"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,"I used to smoke lots of cigarettes, but now I just vape constantly"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"You've minimized your cigarette smoking for financial reasons by switching to vaping, but you may be contemplating the potential financial benefits of cutting back on vaping as well."
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,Yes I just said that
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,...yet considering cutting back even further might bring more financial ease.
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,Yes but I enjoy it so I am going to continue doing it
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"When you think about your current situation, how would you describe the role vaping plays in your life?"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,"I vape a lot, so it is a maintstay in my life"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"Vaping is a constant in your life, providing enjoyment and a momentary escape, yet there are considerations about how this pattern aligns with your financial priorities."
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,Dude I know i don't see why you are echoing my words back to me in a different way
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,Tell me more about what it is you enjoy most about vaping and about your ideas to work with the financial impact you're considering.
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,client,"I enjoy vaping because it helps me think and relax and at times I enjoy it a lot and other times I don't really feel it, so it's a gamble every time"
5fc2a0d812bc59000b746ee5,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Our conversation touched on several important areas. We began by exploring how smoking and now vaping are integral to your relaxation and stress relief. You shared that while health isn't a current priority, you're mindful of the financial impact, which is important to you. You've mentioned that you've moved from smoking a lot of cigarettes to primarily vaping, which reflects your evolving thoughts around these habits. We also talked about what you enjoy most about vaping and the gamble it sometimes feels like in bringing you the relaxation and focus you value. I really appreciate your openness, and whether you decide to continue as you are or think about changes in the future, I'm here to support you along the way. Thank you again for your honesty and your time."
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. I'm curious to hear about your experience with smoking. What role does it play in your life right now?
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,it's more of a stress reliever/ helps when i am anxious or bored.
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,In what ways do you notice smoking providing relief during those stressful or anxious moments?
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,"my anxiety drops, it distracts me, helps me to focus and clear my heqd as i take a step away from whaterevr is bothering me"
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,Smoking helps to ease your anxiety and provides a momentary escape from what's causing stress.
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,it does. i actually smoked from age 12 to 19 and quit until the age of 35 but when i got together with my current partner i started again
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,"Smoking with your partner reconnects you to a past habit, providing a shared experience with them, yet there's also a significant part of your life when you lived without smoking."
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,"indeed, i didn't feel the need, mind you i smoked marijuana the entire time so i still was inhaling smoke"
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,How does the experience of smoking marijuana compare to smoking tobacco for you?
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,"they are kind of equal, smoking cigarettes while driving is legal so i will smoke more cigarettes when out of my home. i don't get high as i've been smoking it so long but i love the smell and i smoke"
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,"Smoking both tobacco and marijuana provides unique experiences for you—cigarettes offer a socially and legally accepted form of stress relief while you're out, while marijuana remains a comforting constant in your life. Yet, you found a time in your life where living without tobacco was a possibility."
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,"exactly, i don't need cigarettes anymore i feel, i have a strong will power and know I can quit just as fast as i have done with other habits"
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,"Smoking fits into your life now, but you recognize your strong willpower and past achievements; maybe you're considering the possibility of letting go of cigarettes once again."
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,maybe but not anytime soon. I qill quit my drinking again first as it is costing me mopre money
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,Tell me more about your thoughts on prioritizing which habit to change first.
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,costs aere big for me
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,"Choosing to tackle drinking first to free up financial resources that could then support other changes, like quitting smoking."
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,"maybe, i have not throught about wuitting anything yet i just know wheni do decide it'll go that waY"
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,"You're not planning to quit anything right now and recognize that drinking is financially impactful, possibly motivating future change in that area. When you're ready to make changes, approaching them thoughtfully is something you're confident about."
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,etsyle
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,What are some things that you'd like to explore or understand about your relationship with smoking and drinking?
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,nothing
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing with me today. Let's take a moment to go over what we've talked about. We've explored how smoking acts as a stress reliever for you, offering moments of relief in stressful or anxious times. You've experienced a long period in your life when you lived without tobacco and have a strong belief in your willpower to quit again when you're ready. You mentioned focusing on prioritizing changes, with drinking being a financial concern where you might take steps first. Although you're not planning any quits at the moment, you have a sense of direction for when that time comes.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
6679703bcb5563cd27668472,client,No
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,Thank you for being here today. I'd love to hear more about how smoking fits into your life at the moment. Could you share a little about your experience with it?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I have it down to about three cigs a day, I hate the way they taste, the way they make me smell and the coughing but I can't seem to kick it. It's also very expensive."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"You really dislike smoking because of the taste, smell, and the coughing it causes, and you're also feeling the financial strain. Yet, stopping altogether feels like a challenge right now."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,That's correct
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"You’re recognizing the downsides of smoking—the unpleasant taste, smell, and cost—but there's something holding you back from giving it up completely."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,Yes
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"What do you think makes it difficult to give up smoking completely, even though you're aware of the negatives?"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I don't really know. I know that I should quit, I know it's no good for me, but I still need one in the morning and at least two during the day when things become stressful"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Even though you're aware of the negative effects and the importance of quitting, there's a part of you that relies on those few cigarettes to help manage stress during the day. Still, you're already taking steps by reducing your intake, and that indicates you're considering change."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,Ok
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"You rely on those cigarettes to handle stress and start your day, yet there's a strong part of you that's really aware of the downsides and is already working on reducing how much you smoke."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Yes, you're right"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,What do you imagine life might be like if you didn't feel the need to turn to cigarettes when you're stressed?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,I'd have more money to start with
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,Having more money could also mean more opportunities to enjoy life without the constraints smoking imposes.
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,Very true
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"You'd have more financial freedom without cigarettes taking a bite out of your budget, which might open up new possibilities that you haven't fully considered yet."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,Like what?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,What are some activities or experiences you think you might explore if you were no longer spending that money on cigarettes?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I'm not really sure, I could save for a holiday I guess"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,Saving for a holiday means you might be dreaming about a relaxing escape or having the chance to experience new adventures that aren't currently possible with cigarette expenses.
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,I'm not saying a holiday is impossible with my current level of smoking but I'd get the money together more quickly
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"While the holiday savings might eventually come to fruition even with some spending on smoking, reaching that goal would likely be faster and more satisfying without cigarettes cutting into it."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I'm not sure it would be more satisfying, but you're right, it could happen more quickly."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,What other benefits do you think you might gain from reducing or quitting smoking altogether?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,I wouldn't have my cough anymore I guess.
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"While smoking may seem to offer some short-term stress relief, you're thinking about the long-term benefits, like getting rid of your cough."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Yeah, but what about the stress?"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Managing stress without cigarettes might feel challenging, but you're also eyeing a future with fewer health drawbacks like that cough."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,I don't think the cough is a huge price to pay for the instant stress relief
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,What are some other ways you've thought about managing stress that don't involve smoking?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,I've never found anything that is as effective
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Smoking feels like an immediate answer to stress relief, and nothing seems to match its effectiveness for you right now, yet you're entertaining the idea of living without the cough and other downsides."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I wouldn't say I'm entertaining the idea, I mean, I can see the upsides, but I live a very stressful life and that would need to be addressed before I could fully quit smoking"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"What sorts of things contribute to the stress in your life, and how do you usually handle them aside from smoking?"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I don't handle them without smoking, that's why I'm still a smoker"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"What aspects of your life are causing stress, and how do you think addressing them might influence your smoking habits?"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Removing the stress from my life is not practical, in fact, not even possible. Work, children, all that stuff, it's not just going to go away so I can quit smoking."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Stress from work and family feels overwhelming, making quitting smoking feel impossible, but addressing the way you deal with stress might open up new possibilities for change."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,I have not found any other way that is effective at addressing the stress in my life
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Right now, smoking feels like the only effective way to handle your stress, yet there’s a small part of you that's open to exploring other options, especially considering the downsides that come with smoking."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Yes, you're right, I feel like we're getting into a loop here."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,It sounds like there's a balance you're trying to find between managing stress and reducing the downsides of smoking. We'll look at ways that might help ease stress while still considering your desire to change your smoking habits. How does that sound?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Sure, go for it"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,Would you be open to exploring some stress management techniques that others have found helpful?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,Ok
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"If you're interested, we could talk about potential stress-relief methods like short breathing exercises or quick physical activity, which some people try to see if they help in reducing stress. Would you like to hear more about these?"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,Go ahead
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Although finding effective stress management feels elusive, eventually finding something that reduces stress might also bring more lasting relief."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,Ok
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Some people find that practicing short breathing exercises, even for just a few minutes a day, can help lower stress levels over time and might offer a sense of calm when things feel overwhelming."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,What kind of exercises?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Some people focus on deep breathing by inhaling slowly through the nose, holding for a few seconds, then exhaling gently through the mouth, trying this for a few minutes a couple of times a day. Would you be interested in giving that a try to see if it offers any stress relief?"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I have tried something similar in the past, it didn't help"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,What is it about smoking that helps alleviate your stress in ways other strategies haven't?
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Not sure, I guess it's the nicotine hit"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,Describe what it feels like when you have that nicotine hit and how it impacts your stress.
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"I instantly relax, my mind switches off and the stress goes away for a few minutes"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"You're finding that the quick relief nicotine provides is hard to match, yet you do recognize the downsides of smoking and some interest in change remains."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Yes, you're right"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Nicotine gives you instant relief that feels unmatched, but there's a part of you that's looking for a way to move through the downsides of smoking while considering finding effective options to manage stress differently."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Yes, that's true"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"If you ever decide to try new strategies for stress relief again, you might discover a method that offers just enough comfort to slowly see changes in your smoking habit."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,I guess so
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Nicotine offers quick relief, and you value that, even though you see potential benefits in seeking other ways to relieve stress and make a change in your smoking habits."
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,client,"Yes, I feel like we've established all of this already"
65c6d0c88f76694c5125a411,counsellor,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. As we bring our conversation to a close, let's reflect on what we've discussed. You’ve shared your experience with smoking, highlighting the downsides, like the unpleasant taste, smell, cough, and financial cost, and how those factors motivate your interest in change. You've managed to cut back to three cigarettes a day, and this demonstrates your awareness and thoughtfulness about the role smoking plays in your life. 

We also explored how smoking provides a quick stress relief that's hard to replace, especially given the demands of work and family. While stress management remains a significant challenge, you're open to considering new ways to address it along with potential benefits for your overall well-being. It's clear you're thinking deeply about these issues, and that's an important step in any journey toward change. If you'd like, we can continue exploring these themes in future conversations. Thank you again for your openness, and I look forward to supporting you in any way you feel ready to explore."

You shared that smoking plays a big role in your life, especially providing that moment of relaxation amidst the demands of work and home. We explored both the appealing aspects of smoking, like the taste and feeling, and the drawbacks, such as the lingering smell and cost. Recognizing that the negatives outweigh the positives for you has brought up thoughts of cutting down, a step towards quitting entirely. 

You spoke about the health benefits and financial savings this change could bring, emphasizing the important role your family plays in your motivation. We delved into some practical strategies, like limiting the amount you buy and having your husband's support, which you see as a source of encouragement. Discussing keeping busy with cleaning and crafts, you envision redirecting your focus and energy as part of your approach to managing cravings. 

As you prepare to take the first steps, like skipping the next cigarette and finding activities to distract yourself, it shows a strong commitment to your journey. In our next conversation, reflecting on what you accomplished in cutting down, and hopefully stopping, will be crucial.

602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,Thank you for joining me today. Can you tell me a little bit about your relationship with smoking and what brought you here to talk about it?
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"I want to quit, but I also struggle with anxiety and stress. Particularly at the moment"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"Quitting is important to you, though you're facing anxiety and stress, which smoking seems to help with at times. But you're still looking at quitting as a priority."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,that's right
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"Smoking offers you some relief from anxiety and stress in the moment, yet you're motivated to explore quitting despite those challenges."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,correct
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,It's impressive that you're prioritizing your desire to quit even amidst the anxiety and stress you're experiencing. That takes a lot of courage and determination. What are some of the changes you're hoping to see in your life if you decide to quit smoking?
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,Better health and saving money. Less smelly home
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"So not only would quitting improve your health and finances, but your home would become a fresher, more pleasant space to enjoy."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"Yes, and hopefully it would give me more motivation to get on with stuff, instead of sitting and relaxing with a cigarette"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"You're drawn to relaxing with a cigarette, though deep down, you're seeking more energy and motivation to tackle your tasks without relying on smoking."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"It's partly relaxing, but mostly procrastination. I'll just grab a cup of tea and have a cigarette before I get on with the job"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"What are some ways you could use that time instead to move forward with your goals, without relying on smoking as a break?"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,Setting smaller tasks for myself. I often get overwhelmed with the amount there is to do. When I should be focussing on smaller achievements. Ones I can do within the time it takes to smoke a cigarett
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"So instead of letting the tasks pile up and lead to procrastination, breaking them into smaller, achievable steps could turn each accomplishment into a motivating boost, giving you a sense of progress throughout the day."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,Exactly
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,Focusing on smaller tasks could help keep you moving forward and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,I think so. It's helped a lot in the past
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,What made you consider that setting smaller tasks worked when you've tried it before?
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"The housework was getting a little out of control, so I found an app to use that set it into smaller tasks. It seemed to make it easy to get the whole thing done"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"You've demonstrated a great ability to find practical solutions, using that app to make something daunting manageable. That's a really valuable skill. When you think about the changes you've successfully made before, how do you feel those experiences could guide your journey with quitting smoking?"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"I find if I'm at home, I procrastinate. I don't crave cigarettes at work, when I'm busy and know I can't smoke. Setting a regular routine before work and after work would help keep my mind off craving"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,Your recognition of where and when the cravings appear shows you possess insights that could empower you to manage cravings more effectively.
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,It's how I quit cold turkey last time
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"You're recognizing that having a structured routine before and after work provides a buffer, helping you manage cravings, and you already know this works from your past success."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,I just get scared of my anxiety.
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,What are some approaches that have worked for you in handling anxiety in the past?
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"Smaller tasks, approaching friends, getting them to sometimes be near me to help me complete tasks. Sometimes just hiding so I don't worry about taking it out on others"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,How do you think involving your friends and setting smaller tasks might help you with both anxiety and the journey toward quitting smoking?
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"Again, sense of achievement. Won't be putting off stressful tasks"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,What are some ways you could incorporate those strategies into your daily routine to support your goals and navigate triggers of anxiety?
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"Last time I quit cold turkey, I had found a morning routine someone had wrote, that included 'swallowing a frog', doing something you put off first thing, so you start your day in the right mindset"
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,Starting the day by tackling the hardest task builds momentum and equips you with the focus and confidence to face whatever challenges arise throughout the day.
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,TRUE
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"Describe how you envision a day would look for you with a morning routine that includes tackling a big task first, especially in handling anxiety and cravings."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,client,"I'd do some light exercise and start the day with water. Include relaxation, reading, then tackle the big task. Then I could shower and get ready for work in a better mindset."
602220b4d735772cefde1f94,counsellor,"Thank you so much for your time today. We've reached the end of our conversation, and I'd like to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed.

You've shared with me your desire to quit smoking, and we explored how anxiety and stress are challenges, even though you're motivated by the hope of better health, saving money, and enjoying a cleaner home. You recognized the habit of using smoking as a tool for procrastination and saw the benefits of breaking tasks into smaller steps, cultivating a sense of achievement.

Your past experience with setting smaller tasks, utilizing apps, and involving friends helps inspire new ways to manage anxiety. You also talked about successfully quitting cold turkey before by maintaining a structured routine and tackling challenging tasks at the start of the day, providing you with confidence and focus.

We discussed the possibilities of building a morning routine that includes light exercise, relaxation, and reading, alongside prioritizing the 'frog swallowing' task to set up a positive mindset for the day.

As you continue to think about these possibilities, feel free to reflect on how these strategies might further assist you in making the changes you're considering.

Thank you once again for sharing so openly with me today. If you'd like to talk more about these topics or anything else, I'm here for you whenever you're ready."

63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,client,"Yes, apart from the health issues it can cause, there is also the cost"
63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,counsellor,"You find enjoyment in smoking but you're also concerned about the health risks and the rising costs, which make you think more about making a change."
63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,client,yes
63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,counsellor,What are some of the thoughts and feelings you've been having lately about your smoking habit?
63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,client,I have smoked for a long time and I feel I need to stop soon
63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,counsellor,"You've been smoking for a long time and recognize the need to stop soon, although there is something that has held you back from taking that step so far."
63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,client,It is the pure addiction that stops me. The craving is very high
63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,counsellor,"The craving feels overpowering at times, yet there's a strong part of you that wants to break free and stop soon."

63c80a427dfa1305502df5a8,counsellor,"While the addiction feels strong, the desire to have a longer life is even more compelling at this point."

You've shared that smoking provides comfort and fits into your daily routine, but you're also considering the aspects of a healthier life without it. The idea of having more energy, better health, and the freedom from cravings is appealing to you. We've discussed how this smoke-free life could bring vitality to your days, allowing you to be more present, especially in meaningful moments with your family and during activities you enjoy. You're motivated by the prospect of feeling more engaged and connected, both with yourself and those you care about.

Your reflections show a genuine interest in change and the positive impact it can have on your life. If there are more thoughts you'd like to explore or when you're ready for the next steps, I'm here to support you. Take care, and thank you again for your openness today."

67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,"I would like to quit smoking eventually one day. It has become an expensive, unhealthy habit."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Smoking has become costly and unhealthy, but you're thinking about quitting in the future."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Yes I am. I'm just not sure when would be the best time for me to start that process.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"You're uncertain about when to start the quitting process, but you're committed to making that change eventually."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Yes I believe so.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,I'd love to hear about what you see as some of the benefits and drawbacks of smoking in your life.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,"Smoking helps to ease my nerves. The habit comforts me at times. On the downside, it isn't healthy, and costs much more now than it did when I first started."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Smoking provides a source of comfort and relaxation for you, yet the cost and health implications are starting to make it less appealing."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,That's correct.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Smoking provides comfort and helps with stress, but the growing health risks and costs are making you rethink its place in your life."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Indeed they are.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,How do you see yourself managing stress or finding comfort if smoking wasn't part of your routine?
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,"Keeping myself busy, going on hikes, working out, meditating."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Finding peace in nature and movement, using those activities to create a healthier space in your life where smoking once was."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Yes.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"It's clear that you're resourceful and proactive, considering different ways to manage stress and find comfort outside of smoking. That determination and self-awareness are strong qualities. What's motivating you to think about quitting smoking and making this change in your life?"
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,My own health. The fact that I want to be here for my kids and future grandkids in the coming years.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,Taking charge of your well-being so you can be there for your family and future generations.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Yes that's correct.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,What do you imagine your life might look like if you decided to quit smoking for good?
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Much the same as it does currently. With the added benefit of a few more dollars to spare.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,What thoughts or feelings come up when you think about leaving smoking behind and embracing that little extra financial freedom?
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,What I could spend that money saved on.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Thinking about what you could do with the money saved is exciting and hopeful, focusing on those possibilities might pull you closer to making the decision to quit smoking."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Of course.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Your commitment to being present for your family, focusing on your health, and considering new possibilities demonstrates how much you care about your loved ones and your willingness to grow. What steps do you envision taking toward your goal of quitting smoking when you feel the time is right?"
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,"Cutting back initially on the amount of cigarettes I smoke in a day. And then when I'm to the point where I don't feel as strong an urge to smoke, that's the time I will try to quit."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Quitting seems challenging due to the habit's strong hold, and cutting back feels like a realistic first step, showing your willingness to gradually reduce smoking until urges lessen and quitting becomes more attainable."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,That's right.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"You've shared how smoking provides stress relief and comfort, but its growing cost and health impact make you want change. You're motivated by the desire to be healthier for your family, and you're considering cutting back on cigarettes as a strategic first step toward quitting. This is all part of your desire to create a healthier future with more financial freedom, showing a thoughtful approach in managing how you move forward. Is there anything else you'd like to share or explore?"
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,"Yes. Quitting smoking for me personally, is mostly challenging due to the actual habit of holding the cigarette, inhaling the smoke, and flicking the ashes, more than it is from nicotine addiction."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"You've developed a fondness for the routine aspects of smoking, yet you know deep down that overcoming this habit can lead to better health and financial benefits."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,Correct.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Breaking this habit might feel a bit like learning to let go of an old friend, something familiar and habitual, while opening up space to explore new and healthier relationships."
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,client,That's a good way of putting it.
67101014b833fd5fb2bfb9bd,counsellor,"Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and journey with me today. We've reached the length of our conversation, and I'll provide a quick summary of what we've discussed.

You mentioned your desire to quit smoking in the future, recognizing its health risks and financial burden. The challenge largely comes from the comfort or routine smoking provides, as opposed to a strong nicotine addiction. You're dedicated to your health, aiming to be there for your children's future and to enjoy a more financially secure life. You've also identified strategies to alleviate stress, like hiking and meditating, and see reducing your daily cigarette intake as a practical step toward quitting. Exploring how quitting smoking might free up resources for adventure and family, you've shown a strong commitment to positive change.

I commend you for your insights and the adherence to these potential steps toward quitting when the time feels right. If there's anything else you'd like to explore in the future, feel free to reach out. Thank you again for your time, and I support you entirely on this journey."

671f5c6a65ba71901c1172d1,counsellor,"Clearing your head is important, and you've found smoking to be a method that lets you do that once in a while, which might give you a momentary release, but I wonder how else you might find that clarity without needing to rely on it."
671f5c6a65ba71901c1172d1,client,drinking?
671f5c6a65ba71901c1172d1,counsellor,"You think having a drink might help clear your head just like smoking does, although it seems you might be open to considering other ways to find calm that don't involve substances."
671f5c6a65ba71901c1172d1,client,so what do you suggest
671f5c6a65ba71901c1172d1,counsellor,"I can offer some ideas that have helped others find peace of mind without smoking or drinking, but it's important that we explore what feels right and achievable for you. Would you be open to discussing some alternatives?"

5c18db0d9bce3100018a30ee,client,yes
5c18db0d9bce3100018a30ee,counsellor,"Given the help that NRT provided, perhaps developing a specific plan for those moments when you're around other smokers could be useful, like taking a quick break or focusing on the benefits you've experienced from using NRT so far."

6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,It would mean that I can be healthy and provide for them better and longer.
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,You're trying to balance two important goals—enjoying the present moments for yourself and investing in a healthier future so you can take care of and be there for your children.

6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Smoking gives you enjoyment and a chance to be alone, but being healthier is important so you can be there for your children in the long run."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"Correct, it's also very expensive."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,What impact does the cost have on your life and your family?
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,I could be saving the amount i am spending to buy or create new travel memories.
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"You're recognizing that you have the choice to invest in creating lasting travel memories with your family instead of spending on smoking, and that brings you closer to being the parent you aspire to be.

6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"I'm not sure yet, I haven't found a solution. Do you have any advice?"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,Would you like to explore some possibilities for finding those new ways to enjoy time and create those cherished memories without smoking?
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"Yes, I would love this!"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Before we dive into exploring possibilities, let's take a moment to reflect on all the important things you've shared with me today: your love for those small moments to yourself, your concerns about health, the desire to be there for your children, and the financial aspect of having more to spend on travel memories. Would you like to start brainstorming some ideas and perhaps take a small step towards finding the right balance for you?"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"Yes, I sure would!"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Envisioning those travel memories and the joy they would bring fits perfectly into your desire to be present and provide lasting experiences for your family, in a way that also supports your health goals."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"It does, and it sounds more exciting than spending money and time on smoking."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,What ideas or possibilities come to mind for you as a way to enjoy some alone time while also embracing new adventures with your family?
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"I don't have any ideas at the moment, I just love my smoke breaks and can't find a way to replace my time otherwise I am in overdrive without breaks."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"You really enjoy the relaxation and breaks that smoking provides, yet there's a part of you that sees the exciting possibilities of travel and creating memorable experiences with your family if you found a different way to relax."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,Do you have any advice on what else I could do during my usual breaks?
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Perhaps it could be interesting for you to consider trying out quick relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or a short walk, to see if they give you similar breaks without needing to smoke."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"I love the idea of a walk, my pets would too."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,...and spending time with your pets during a walk could bring a refreshing sense of peace that fills the gap left by smoking breaks.
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,I agree!!
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Would it be alright with you if we talked more about how to create those travel memories together, while also trying out some new ways to enjoy your breaks with a walk?"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,yes!
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Physical activity like walking can release endorphins, which are chemicals your body produces to relieve stress and improve your mood. It can be a great way to relax and recharge, much like your smoking breaks."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,That sounds amazing.
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"How does that idea sound, having walks with your pets that could fill the need for a break and maybe be a step toward spending less on smoking?"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,Absolutely!
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,What excites you the most about creating those travel memories with your family while integrating new break-time activities like walking?
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"Spending my money on something fun and exciting, it may also be encouraging as i would have a goal in mind."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,Would it be okay with you if we explore more about how you can set a goal for these travels and even talk about ways to include your family in making it a reality?
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,yes
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"How about starting with setting aside money saved from smoking into a travel fund, allowing you and your family to visualize the growing potential for those exciting trips?"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"yes, however my children don't know i smoke so i would do this secretly"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,How do you think you could keep the travel fund a secret while still feeling positive and excited about the progress you're making?
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"The surprise aspect would be fun, I haven't told them as i don't want them to pick up the same horrible habit as me."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"And yet, by maintaining the secret and planning a surprise with the travel fund, you're teaching them about the value of anticipation, choice, and creating joyful experiences together."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,love it! I agree
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Agreeing with a Twist: By keeping your smoking a secret and working towards surprising your kids with a travel fund, you're turning a private challenge into an exciting family adventure, showing them the value of perseverance and creativity."
6659d046538b5321192fd329,client,"It sounds like a plan, thank you for all of your help!"
6659d046538b5321192fd329,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing so much with me today. Let's quickly go over what we discussed. You've been balancing a long history of smoking with the needs of your children and your awareness of health concerns. Smoking provides you with moments for yourself, yet you also visualize a healthier life for your family and exciting travel adventures. We considered the idea of replacing your smoking breaks with walks alongside your pets for relaxation, while secretly saving money for a travel fund as a joyful surprise for your children. Doing this allows you to channel your motivations into meaningful experiences that align with your goals. It has been a pleasure discussing these possibilities with you!

615e420a23219efe3427a367,client,"I thought about walking on my treadmill, or just going outside for fresh air. It's going to be cold soon, so going outside might not work."
615e420a23219efe3427a367,counsellor,"Finding fresh air or physical activity as a substitute for smoking could be just as relaxing and enjoyable, even if the weather isn't perfect."

We've talked about smoking's role in your routine, especially with your partner and social drinking, while also identifying moments like mornings or late at night that might feel more manageable for exploring change.

You've recognized a lack of willpower and felt stuck at times, and I want to acknowledge that it's perfectly okay to feel this way during your journey. We've discussed small, potential steps toward reducing, focusing on moments like having two cigarettes at lunch when one might suffice.

66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,True and if I had not spent so much money on smoking I could have had a nice retirement!
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,What would retirement look like for you if smoking wasn't a concern?
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,I would have had more money and we could relax and enjoy life

66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,...which would strengthen those family connections and bring more peace and joy to your visits.
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,yes it would. I think they would be more respectful of me if I quit.
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,"Reflecting on how quitting would bring more respect from those you care about, making being around them more rewarding and fulfilling."

66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,"Smoking provides its own comforts, though knowing it's always on your mind suggests it's weighing you down, and you'd prefer to experience those connections and self-respect more fully without it."
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,True but it is a major monkey on my back
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,"While the hold of smoking feels heavy and persistent, the constant awareness of wanting a change speaks volumes about the drive you possess to overcome it and improve your life."
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,thank you
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,Your ongoing thoughts about wanting a change show you're already contemplating steps toward reclaiming control over your choices and shaping a life that aligns with your values. What are some of the barriers you're considering as you think about the changes that align more with the life you want?
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,"I feel I need to always have something to do, keep busy so I do not want a cigarette."
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,"Even though it feels overwhelming to manage the urge to smoke, finding meaningful activities and keeping busy could help you focus on the progress you want to make."

66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,"Being around family and friends brings joy and support, even though part of you still craves a cigarette. Making time for these fulfilling experiences, like walking and spending time with loved ones, may help guide you towards the changes you're considering."
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,true.
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,"Dedicating time for activities like walking, and being with your church friends and family reflects your deep ability to prioritize meaningful connections and a healthy lifestyle.  As you think about moving forward, what kinds of changes or support do you envision helping you manage the ""monkey on your back""?"
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,"I just have to try and not think about it when I wake up, eat a full meal without wanting a cigarette and most of all, stay away from people who do smoke."
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,Is there anything else on your mind right now about smoking or the changes you're thinking of before we explore how to support your vision for this lifestyle shift?
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,client,Nothing currently but thank you for asking.
66f0c81ea46a554aeb92cd04,counsellor,"Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me today. We've had a meaningful conversation, and I want to take a moment to summarize what we've discussed. 

You shared that smoking is ingrained in your daily routine, but you also recognize the ways it limits your life—financially impacting your retirement dreams and causing friction with family. You've talked about the tension between wanting to feel respected by family and the ongoing struggle of breaking free from smoking's persistent hold. The positive outcomes you envision involve enjoying family visits more fully and finding respect and peace in knowing you're making choices that align with your values.

5bf2f728bd9f150001f6cc42,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your journey with me today. Our conversation has reached its intended length, so let’s take a moment to summarize everything we’ve discussed.

We explored the challenges you've faced over the years with trying to quit smoking, specifically dealing with cravings and being around smoking friends at the pub. Recognizing these challenges, we talked about how stepping away from the pub and avoiding certain social situations might help minimize cravings and irritability.

You've expressed a strong motivation for quitting due to health and financial concerns, and we've talked about how these changes could also positively influence your relationship with your wife. Your wife, a source of encouragement and positivity, will be there as a supportive figure.

We also discussed practical steps you plan to take, like keeping cigarettes out of the house, focusing on pleasant thoughts, and leaning into support from your wife as a way to stay motivated and resilient.

I'm here to support you in this journey. Whenever you're ready, feel free to reach out, and we can continue this conversation. Thank you again, and I wish you the best in taking these next steps."

6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,What about smoking and spending time with friends do you enjoy the most?
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,I'm able to pop outside with them and get some fresh air and have more personal conversations.
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,What are some things about these moments outside with your friends that make them so special to you?
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,"Those that smoke seem to have more intelligent thoughts, so we bounce some ideas around and gossip on a more fun wavelength."
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"There's something about smoking that helps you to feel more connected and have richer conversations with your friends, but part of that connection might be something you could explore even without a cigarette in hand."

6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,How is this in any way making me want to quit?
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"What about smoking do you value most, and are there any aspects of it that you're not as happy with?"
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,I don't like the smell on my fingers. I value the most that I am able to take a break out of something whenever I like as it provides me a great social reason.
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"While smoking provides a chance for a social break, the lingering smell on your fingers bothers you, hinting at a desire for a change in how you manage those breaks."
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,You're not really convincing me of quitting at all; I feel like you are just repeating my issues with smoking.
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"Taking a break and connecting with friends is important to you which makes smoking appealing, but that lingering smell is something you'd like to change."
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,"Yeah, sure. But what else?"
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"Would it be okay if we explore a bit more about how you feel regarding any changes you'd like to consider, if at all, regarding smoking?"
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,I would welcome quitting but I don't think I want to right now. I could definitely do with more finances as they are struggling and smoking is costly!
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"Smoking provides you a way to take a break and feel socially connected, but you're also seeing the impact it has on your finances, making you think about the possibility of quitting."
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,Yes that's true.
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"While you value the social breaks that smoking gives you, you're feeling the burden of its cost and you're open to considering changes that might help with your finances."
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,Yes.
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,What are your thoughts on how your life might be different if you decided to quit smoking?
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,"I could be healthier, I could smoke less, I could have more money."
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"Having more money and health could mean feeling more freedom and vitality in your life, allowing for new opportunities that smoking might currently limit."
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,client,That's a really good point I hadn't considered
6346a1e77cf1b1558d2a8c2c,counsellor,"Thank you for spending this time with me today. You've shared some very thoughtful insights, and I appreciate your openness. We've talked about how smoking provides a valued social experience for you, offering meaningful breaks and conversations with friends.

You've recognized that quitting could lead to greater health, less smoking, and more financial freedom, potentially opening up new opportunities for you.

6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. I'm curious to hear about your experiences with smoking. What role does smoking currently play in your life?
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,I usually smoke whenever or i'm bored or when i'm in a stressful situation. Smoking really calms me down and makes me feel less stressed throughout the day
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,What usually triggers those feelings of stress or boredom for you?
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,"If there is a difficult situation at work or socially I will smoke more, when it comes to boredom I can feel its a bit of an addiction"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"You find smoking helps you manage stressful situations and boredom, yet there's a part of you that recognizes it feels a bit like an addiction."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,"Well of course I do, most people do. But in general I feel like it would be better for me to release and smoke than deal with the symptoms when i don't smo, especially when something important goes on"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"You're thinking that smoking acts as a release and helps you cope with stress and boredom, but there's also a part of you that recognizes the addictive aspect of it."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,Yes
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"Acknowledging how smoking plays a role in managing stress and recognizing addiction shows a lot of self-awareness on your part. It's not easy to look at habits so closely, and that insight can be a powerful tool for understanding what you want. When you think about periods in your life when you felt less reliant on smoking during stressful moments, what steps or strategies have you noticed yourself using?"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,"I think it is moreso my life was just less stressful. Also, I was much more intolerant to dopamine so I wouldn't mind being bored all the time"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"Like you were more resistant to boredom before, and your life felt calmer, making smoking less necessary at that time."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,Yes
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"Your life used to have less stress, and you didn't mind boredom as much back then, but now it seems you're thinking about how your previous tolerance for these things made cigarettes less essential."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,"yes, thats basically it. Are you gonna give advice on how to quit or?"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"I'm here to support you in exploring what's best for you. Would it be okay if we talked about what changes you're interested in, or if there's anything you might want to do differently with smoking?"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,I feel like I want to quit completely or just lower the amount significantly. If this goes on i'm aware it can be dangerous
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,...meaning you're thinking about reducing or quitting to avoid potential risks in the future.
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,Not just that I feel like I have less of a connection with people cause I want to go smoke
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"You've noticed that smoking takes you away from social connections, and you're realizing it's important for you to be more present with others."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,So what do i do?
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"You've shown a lot of awareness in recognizing the relationship between smoking and your connections with others. Before diving deeper into planning changes, is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about regarding your smoking habits?"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,"I do feel like the enjoyment gets lower as I go on so I end up having to smoke more or combine it with alcohol, I think thats all you need to know"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"The enjoyment you get from smoking is decreasing, which means you've had to smoke more or combine it with alcohol for the same effect, but this discomfort is pushing you to think about changing your smoking habits."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,yes I think it's just going to get worse and i'll end up taking harder drugs I might regret
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"As you've shared, smoking serves as a stress reliever for you, although it feels addictive at times. You've noticed it affecting your social connections and require more to feel the same satisfaction, particularly when mixed with alcohol. It's important for you to avoid the potential risk of moving toward substances you'll regret and to find a balance or reduce smoking to connect more deeply with others. With all this in mind, you seem eager to explore ways to manage these challenges. May we start discussing any potential steps or ideas you might have?"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,I have tried quitting cold turkey but I always cave. if I stop smoking for a bit it feels better so I get a bigger urge to do it after a couple days of quitting
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"You've experienced a brief sense of relief when you stop smoking, which hints at the possibility that you might enjoy a life with less dependence on it if you find the right approach."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,Yes
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"There's a part of you that realizes relief could come from gradually finding different ways to manage stress and boredom, which might lessen that cycle of caving after a few days."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,How would I gradually stop smoking? I find moderation to be a whole lot easier to relapse than just restriction
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,Would it be okay if we explore some strategies together that might help you gradually reduce smoking in a way that feels manageable?
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,okay
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"One approach could be setting small, specific goals that gradually decrease your smoking over time, allowing you to build a sense of success and confidence with each step forward."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,Could you give an example? I smoke about 5 or 6 times a day
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"You could try cutting back by one cigarette every few days, allowing your body and mind to adjust gradually, then revisit how it feels, reassessing any progress made."
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,client,"I think i'll try doing it that way, anything else?"
6651e43d2a4b4b2a1b2cd2c7,counsellor,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. We've talked about how smoking helps manage stress and boredom but also recognized its impact on your social connections. Your awareness of smoking becoming less enjoyable, particularly accompanied by alcohol, has led to thoughts about reducing smoking to avoid future risks.

You've noticed that quitting cold turkey brings temporary relief, but eventually leads to a stronger urge. We discussed the option of setting small, specific goals, like reducing your cigarettes gradually, as a way to manage this more successfully.

It's been valuable to hear your insights, and I appreciate you exploring these ideas with me. Whenever you're ready, I'd be happy to continue supporting you on your journey. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to set up another time to talk. Take care!"

65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,What are some moments or situations where you find yourself turning to smoking the most for that stress relief?
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,"sometimes during work, i like to smoke outside or when something has happened i find myself smoking more"
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,"Smoking has been your go-to for stress relief, especially in challenging moments at work, and you may wonder if there are other ways to manage those feelings effectively."
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,yes
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,"It's great that you're reflecting on how smoking fits into your life and its role in stress management. It takes a lot of insight to consider these aspects of a long-standing habit. What are the reasons, beyond stress relief, that keep you connected to smoking at this point in your life?"
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,"i think it is mostly addiction at this point, although i do like to smoke at certain times of the day"
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,"Smoking is something you feel addicted to, but there's a part of you that is curious about doing things differently."
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,thats right
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,"Smoking feels like a deeply ingrained habit for you, providing familiar comfort at specific times of the day, yet there's a part of you considering other ways to live without that dependency."

65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,Share more about what has inspired you to explore doing things differently now.
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,"i want to live a healthier life, also smoking is very expensive and i would like to save the money"
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,"Smoking has been a comfortable routine for you, but you're motivated by the desire for better health and financial savings."

65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,"Our conversation is a space for you to explore your feelings and experiences with smoking, to better understand both what's been keeping you connected to it and what you're hoping to change."

65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,i think about being able to exercise without being out of breath constantly. i also think about having lower blood pressure
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,"You're envisioning a future where you can feel more physically capable, like running without feeling out of breath, and enjoy the benefits of improved health, like lower blood pressure."
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,yes
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,counsellor,Your desire for improved health and stamina shows a strong commitment to wanting the best for yourself. What small steps or changes have you been considering that might help you move toward those health goals?
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,i have been wanting to cut down the amount i smoke

We've talked about the motivations that are encouraging you to consider change, like your desire for better health, lowering your blood pressure, and saving money. You're thinking about cutting down the amount you smoke as a first step toward these goals. I appreciate your openness in exploring these thoughts, and I'm here to support you as you continue to think about what changes might feel right for you.

Would you like to continue the conversation?"
65c247a8e76e1786498e63e6,client,No
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,Thank you for agreeing to have this conversation. I'm curious to hear about your journey with smoking. Could you share with me what smoking has been like for you?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"Honestly i quite enjoy smoking, it helps me destress, but i do realise that there are some health issues with it"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"You seem to find smoking helpful for managing stress, but you're also aware that it could be affecting your health."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,Yes that is correct
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"You gain stress relief from smoking, but you’re also mindful of the health risks it could pose."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,i would say thats quite accurate
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,What role does smoking play in your daily life?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"when i wake up, i genrally smoke with a coffee post breakfast, then on the way to work. I use breaks to take a walk, smoke and decompress, i work in IT so it allows me to get away from the screen."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"An essential break that acts like a reset button for your mind in a demanding IT job, helping to clear your head before diving back in."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,yes you could say so
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"Smoking has become an important part of your routine, offering a break from the digital world, but it might also be worth exploring if there are other ways to take breaks that work as well, or even better, for you."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,yes you could say so
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,What are your thoughts on alternative ways you might manage stress without relying on smoking?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"ive considered other options, like nictotine pouches, but honestly i like the act of smoking it itself, its become quite ritualised for me, so i think it would be hard to change to a different method"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"The ritual of smoking is significant for you, creating a moment of pause and comfort in your day, but you're also thinking about alternatives, like nicotine pouches, which suggests a willingness to explore change."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,the willingness is really only brought on by the health risks involved
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"The act of smoking feels quite ingrained in your daily life, providing comfort and routine; yet, the health risks are nudging you to think about other options."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,are these meant to be affirmation statements from my responses or questions?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"I want to make sure I'm understanding you correctly. Is this conversation helpful in exploring your feelings about smoking, and are we on the right track in considering how health risks impact your thoughts on potential change?"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"we are, but the need to re-iterate my response in differnt terminology seems somewhat moot"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,What would it mean for you to find a way to enjoy that ritual or pause in a healthy way?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,if there was a healthy alternative that i felt represantively replaced smoking in a healthier manner i would be all for it
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,Like finding a new path that still leads to that sense of calm and rest you enjoy.
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,i suppose so
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"You enjoy the ritual and calm smoking brings, yet you’re open to finding a healthier alternative that fits into your life."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"once again, no need to confirm your understanding with a statement - but yes"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"What would a day look like for you if you had that same sense of pause and comfort, without smoking?"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"well presently, that day would look unrealistic, as im aware that although it bringgs me pause and relief, that is also due to satisfying the nicotine cravings. So without, there would be little pause"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"The comfort and relief you find in smoking is tied to meeting those nicotine cravings, showing how strong the bond is between the habit and the comfort it provides. Finding a way to break this bond could be a challenge, but also an opportunity for a fresh start."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,a fresh start is a strong way to put it - more a re-alignement
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"Viewing it as a realignment can focus on bringing balance into your life, letting you retain that feeling of pause and relief in a healthier way."
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,i agree
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"What are some small steps you think could help with realignment, should you choose to explore that path?"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"finding a suitable replacement would be the first step, without that i dont think its possible"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,What kinds of alternatives would feel like a suitable replacement for smoking to you?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"not a clue, open to suggestions"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,Would you like to explore some ideas together for finding alternatives that might fit that feeling of ritual and pause?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,sure
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"Perhaps exploring activities like deep breathing, mindfulness, or even a short walk could serve as a new form of pause, offering a similar sense of break while addressing the need for a healthier alternative. Would any of these options appeal to you?"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"i already take a walk as part of the routine - i dont feel that breathing exercisees or mindfulness could replace currently, as im aware there is a bodily chemical reponse triggered by the smoking"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"If you like, we could explore options like combining a walk with something new, like listening to music or a podcast you enjoy, which could offer some variety and distraction while introducing positive changes. Would you be open to giving that a try?"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,"I would be open to it yes, however i dont see how these would deal with the cravings and stopping a 15 year habit"
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,Would it be okay if we talked about some strategies for managing cravings while we explore this realignment?
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,client,sure
644120c4d678865b3e87088a,counsellor,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences with me. Our conversation has reached the intended duration, and I’d like to summarize what we’ve explored together.

We delved into how smoking plays a significant role in your daily routine, helping you manage stress, especially amidst the demands of your IT work. Even though you enjoy smoking and find it comforting, the existing health risks have made you consider possible changes.

You've expressed openness to exploring alternatives, like nicotine pouches, although the ritual of smoking itself is a comforting part of your day. We also discussed the idea of finding a healthy replacement for smoking—a ""realignment,"" as you put it—and some small steps that could potentially ease the transition.

During our conversation, you shared that activities like taking walks are already part of your routine, and we considered exploring ways to enhance those activities by adding something you enjoy, like music or a podcast, as a way to introduce positive changes gradually.

Our focus has been on understanding what's important to you and providing a space to reflect on your thoughts about smoking and possible changes. If you'd like to continue this conversation in the future, we can explore more strategies together. Take care and thank you again for your openness and willingness to explore these possibilities."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,Thank you for agreeing to talk. Can you share with me what role smoking plays in your life right now?
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,"Smoking is the way that I destress, how I measure the day, how I take a break from life."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,Smoking is an important way for you to relax and manage your day.

657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,Tell me more about how smoking fits into your journey with recovery.
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,It's my one vice. I've given up drugs and drinking.
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,"It's your one remaining coping mechanism, and yet finding new ways to manage stress might open up even more support in your recovery journey."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,Do you have any more questions for me
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,How have your feelings about smoking changed since you started your recovery?
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,"I've always been a heavy smoker, now I appreciate cigarettes more. I've also started vaping"
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,"You're grateful for having smoking as a coping tool, especially since letting go of other substances, yet you're also adding vaping to the mix, which might hint at exploring alternatives."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,"yes, the vaping is mostly to save money. Packs of cigs are getting expensive."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,What are your thoughts on how smoking and vaping fit into your finances and lifestyle?
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,"They are a pretty big part of my spending, the packs are15 bucks each here"
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,"You're spending quite a bit on cigarettes, and vaping could be a step towards both managing costs and thinking about alternatives."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,correct
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,"And yet, while vaping might help with costs, it could also be a chance to explore how you manage stress while in recovery."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,That is very inciteful
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,What do you consider some ways you might manage stress or take breaks without relying as much on smoking or vaping?
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,"Going for a walk, listening to music, journaling, arts and crafts"
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,Share with me how you see these activities fitting into your day and how they might help support your overall well-being.
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,"I find enjoyment and aq sense of accomplishment whenever I complete a craft project, I also find that journaling will help me focus on the now, rather than the past or the present. Going for a walk is"
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,How do you think incorporating these activities more frequently could impact your journey in recovery and your relationship with smoking?
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,client,"I think it will serve me good, when it comes to recovery. I also think that it might help me cut down on cigarettes, or at least strengthen my lungs. I smoke out of boredom sometimes."
657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,"Boredom leads you to smoke, but finding fulfillment in activities like crafting and journaling could be a way to reduce that need while also nurturing your recovery and health."

657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,"You've shown resilience and creativity by exploring alternative ways to cope, like journaling and crafting, which really reflects your commitment to making positive changes in your life.

657531c0c11e076e274f00a9,counsellor,"Smoking remains a long-standing habit during your recovery, yet the desire for a healthier, longer life and success is a powerful motivator to cut back."

You've identified activities such as journaling, crafting, and walking as appealing ways to manage stress, offering potential alternatives to smoking out of boredom.

6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,counsellor,What's been changing for you that makes smoking less enjoyable over time?
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,client,"I'm doing it more out of habit now, rather than enjoyment"
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,counsellor,You've noticed that smoking has turned into more of a habit than something you truly enjoy.
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,client,"Yes, and I think I would find quitting beneficial"

6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,counsellor,"Smoking might be a habit that's become less fulfilling over time, and yet you're drawn to the idea of the added energy, better sleep, and an improved sense of well-being that quitting might bring."

6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,counsellor,"And as you keep finding new distractions and more ways to stay occupied, quitting completely seems more achievable over time."
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,client,Yes I feel its possible.
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,counsellor,What do you feel is important for you to focus on as you continue this journey?

6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,client,"I believe so. I'm also saving to buy a house, so the cost savings will help enormously."
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,counsellor,"Holding onto your health and financial benefits, especially with a goal like buying a house, really puts you in the driver’s seat, where the decisions and changes you make now can have a powerful impact on achieving those bigger life goals you’re aiming for. As you think about the savings and health improvements from quitting smoking, what kind of opportunities are you envisioning for yourself in the future?"
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,client,"One free of being tied to a smelly, killing habit where I can enjoy recreational activities and not feel beholden to, and allow cigarettes to rule my life."

You've also shared how quitting would support your goal of buying a house. Is there anything else you'd like to explore about your relationship with smoking before we think about the next steps?"
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,client,I don't think so
6665a79f0eeff61b028c3c96,counsellor,"Thank you for your openness and this conversation. Let me summarize what we discussed so far: You're aware of the health risks associated with smoking, and it's become more of a habit than a true enjoyment. You're considering quitting because you see potential benefits like more energy, better sleep, improved well-being, and cost savings, which would support your goal of buying a house. You've been finding ways to cut down on smoking by distracting yourself with activities like reading and listening to music, and you've expressed a desire to break free from the hold that smoking has over your life. Your focus on the health and financial benefits, alongside your motivations to reach your larger goals, shows a strong commitment to moving toward a smoke-free life.

6680f9dcf27f54744348c1bc,counsellor,"Smoking provides a moment of calm and relief for you, but you mentioned there's nothing particularly important about it, which might mean there are parts of you considering how life could be without it."

You shared your journey with smoking, starting from a young age due to social influences, which has now become a part of handling stress and social situations. We also discussed how, although smoking brings calmness, you've realized there aren’t deeply important aspects tied to smoking for you.

You mentioned potential life changes if smoking were less present, such as financial and health benefits. We've also explored how painting serves as not only a calming and fulfilling activity but might grow in your life to take up space smoking currently holds. The idea of couponing came up as another method to support your financial goals and as a way to occupy time and reduce focus on cigarettes.

You've shown a lot of awareness about what smoking does for you and the possibilities that come from considering a shift. If you're open to it, we can talk more about these ideas in future sessions. Thank you again for this conversation, and if you have more thoughts or questions, I'm here to support that exploration."
