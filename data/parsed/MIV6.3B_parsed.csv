Enjoying outdoor activities, like gardening and walking your dog, adds a delightful touch to your journey towards a smoke-free life.

You've shared that smoking serves as a break and stress reliever for you, yet it brings several negatives into your life, including health concerns, financial strain, and social challenges. Your doctor has shared concerns regarding quitting right now due to the potential impact on your overall health, which echoes the complexity of your situation. Despite this, your determination to quit is strong, and you're already envisioning the financial freedom it could bring.

We explored the possibility of small, manageable changes to address your smoking habits, such as identifying alternative stress-relief activities that could align with your needs. You recognized that sometimes smoking fulfills a need, like taking a walk or stepping away from your desk, and it’s great that you're considering addressing the root of the habit especially with ADHD considerations.

You've shared the challenges of smoking both dodgy cigarettes and vaping, primarily due to stress relief from work and your social life. You've expressed concern about the physical effects, especially on your skin, which suggests your health and appearance are important to you. Your work is quite physical, and although it involves dealing with some unpleasant situations that increase your stress, these cigarettes act as a break companion. You're interested in exploring other ways to relieve stress, like perhaps mixing your coffee with another comforting routine during your breaks.

You reflected on how smoking has been integrated into your life since you were 14, and you've made significant progress by reducing from 30 cigarettes a day to 10. We explored your feelings of enjoyment and reliance on smoking, alongside some contemplations about further reducing your intake due to costs and social changes. 

You shared intentions to cut down further to five cigarettes a day, acknowledging the strategies that have served you well so far—such as skipping the first cigarette of the day, extending time without smoking after meals, and deliberately stretching out the time between cigarettes by eating meals instead. 

Your thoughtful approach and willingness to try new ideas stood out, and it sounds like you've been patient and creative with the reductions you've already made. If and when you're ready to discuss more, or if anything new comes up, I'm here to support you. Thank you again for coming in and sharing your experiences.",6412,50,Thank you again for coming in and sharing your experiences.

You're currently using roll-up cigarettes and have been worried about the impact on your health and finances, which has encouraged you to think about making a change. While the ritual of rolling provides comfort and keeps your hands busy, you’re considering steps like delaying your first cigarette by doing yoga and drinking more water to possibly reduce your smoking. These small steps speak to your determination to move towards a healthier lifestyle, despite feeling some excitement, apprehension, fear, and hope about the future. Remember, these emotions are natural in the process of change. Keep those strategies in mind moving forward, they seem like positive alternatives and stepping stones to support you on this path.

To recap, we discussed your experience with smoking mainly as a way to manage anxiety, although you've noticed that it sometimes increases your restlessness. You mentioned that your anxiety extends beyond smoking, with smoking offering temporary relief that leads to further discomfort. 

We explored the idea of uncovering the root of your anxiety, where you suggested that a lack of quality sleep might play a role. From there, we talked about building a consistent bedtime routine, starting with setting a solid bedtime and aiming for eight hours of restful sleep.

You showed a willingness to take steps toward improving your sleep, understanding that it could help alleviate your anxiety and create a positive start in reducing your reliance on smoking.

As you begin making these changes, feel free to reach out whenever you'd like to continue this conversation or need further support. You're taking important steps toward positive change, and I'm here to support you along the way. Take care, and I'm looking forward to hearing how things evolve.",6974,87,Thank you for your time today.

Smoking in the evenings has become a way for you to unwind, like others might with an evening drink. While it doesn't dominate your life, you’re mindful of potential health issues, like lung or throat cancer, which have been causing some concern.

You also shared that you'd love to experience more energy and less anxiety—benefits you associate with reducing or quitting smoking. Though you're not ready to change just yet, you're planning to move toward this change soon, prioritizing feeling mentally and physically better in your day-to-day life.

You've shared that smoking plays a role in managing university stress, yet you're aware of the grip of addiction. While it's helping you through current pressures, there's an openness to reconsider its place in your life post-graduation.

You appreciate the idea of tracking each instance of smoking in your notes to foster understanding and control, even if the trend may vary.

Looking forward, you expressed some concern about how to fill spare moments that might otherwise be occupied by smoking, such as waiting for a bus or taking study breaks.

You've shared with me your desire to quit smoking, and we explored how anxiety and stress are challenges, even though you're motivated by the hope of better health, saving money, and enjoying a cleaner home. You recognized the habit of using smoking as a tool for procrastination and saw the benefits of breaking tasks into smaller steps, cultivating a sense of achievement.

Your past experience with setting smaller tasks, utilizing apps, and involving friends helps inspire new ways to manage anxiety. You also talked about successfully quitting cold turkey before by maintaining a structured routine and tackling challenging tasks at the start of the day, providing you with confidence and focus.

We discussed the possibilities of building a morning routine that includes light exercise, relaxation, and reading, alongside prioritizing the 'frog swallowing' task to set up a positive mindset for the day.

As you continue to think about these possibilities, feel free to reflect on how these strategies might further assist you in making the changes you're considering.

Thank you once again for sharing so openly with me today.
