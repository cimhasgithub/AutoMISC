6693ad02e4dd0cfa3a193d75,1067,counsellor,"CQ, FA, GI","Of course! Here's a brief overview of how they work: Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT): NRT provides you with a lower, controlled dose of nicotine to help reduce withdrawal symptoms while you're quitting smoking. It's available in various forms like patches, gums, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays. The idea is to gradually reduce your nicotine dependence. Varenicline (Chantix): This medication works by affecting nicotine receptors in the brain. It helps alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduces the pleasure you get from smoking, making it less appealing. Bupropion (Zyban): An antidepressant that also helps reduce cravings and withdrawal effects. It’s believed to work on neurotransmitters in the brain that are involved in addiction and mood regulation. Each of these options has its own benefits and possible side effects.
