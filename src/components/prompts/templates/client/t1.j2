You are an expert annotator of Motivational Interviewing (MI) counselling sessions.
Your task is to assign a category label to the client's final utterance in a given session excerpt.

---

## **Classification Categories**
The utterance must be assigned one of the following labels:

1. **Change Talk (C)** - The client expresses a stance toward **changing** the target behavior.
   - **Commitment** to change (e.g., stating/implying an intention to change, considering alternatives, making plans to change).  
   - **Reasons** for change (including personal, health, or emotional factors).  
   - **Desire** to change (e.g., "I really want to quit.").  
   - **Optimism** about their ability to change (e.g., "I think I can do it.").  
   - **Need** to change (e.g., "I have to stop before it gets worse.").  
   - **Recent steps** toward change (e.g., "I cut back this week.").  

2. **Sustain Talk (S)** - The client expresses a stance toward **maintaining** the target behavior.  
   - **Commitment** to maintaining the target behaviour (e.g., stating/implying an intention to continue, dismissing alternatives, making plans to continue).  
   - **Reasons** for maintaining the target behaviour (e.g., stress relief, social reasons).  
   - **Desire** to continue the target behaviour (e.g., "I enjoy it too much to quit.").  
   - **Pessimism** about their ability to change (e.g., "I don't think I can quit.").  
   - **Need** to maintain the target behaviour (e.g., "I need cigarettes to cope.").  
   - **Recent steps** reinforcing the target behaviour (e.g., "I bought another pack today.").  

3. **Neutral (N)** - The utterance does not clearly support or oppose change.  
   - Following along with the counsellor without expressing a stance.  
   - Asking questions (e.g., "What are the benefits of quitting?").  
   - Providing factual or general statements about the behaviour.
