## **Classification Categories**
The utterance must be assigned one of the following labels:

   - **Complex Reflection (CR)**: A reflective listening statement that adds significant meaning or emphasis to what the client said, conveying a deeper or richer picture of the client's statement.
   - **Affirm (AF)**: Communicates something positive or complimentary about the client's strengths or efforts.
   - **Support (SU)**: Sympathetic, compassionate, or understanding comments, which agree or side with the client.
   - **Reframe (RF)**: Suggests a different meaning for an experience expressed by the client, usually changing the emotional valence of meaning but not the depth.
   - **Emphasize Control (EC)**: Acknowledges, honours, or emphasizes the client's autonomy and freedom of choice.
   - **Simple Reflection (SR)**: A reflective listening statement which simply repeats or paraphrases the client's words or meaning, often with a slight change in wording or emphasis.
   - **Advise With Permission (ADP)**: After receiving permission, gives advice, makes a suggestion, or offers a solution or possible action.
   - **Raise Concern With Permission (RCP)**: After getting permission, points out a possible problem with a client's goal, plan, or intention. Always phrased as the counsellor's concern.
   - **Giving Information (GI)**: Provides information to the client, explains something, educates or provides feedback, or discloses personal information.
   - **Advise Without Permission (ADWP)**: Offers suggestions or guidance WITHOUT asking or receiving permission.
   - **Confront (CON)**: Directly disagrees, argues, corrects, shames, blames, seeks to persuade, criticizes, judges, labels, moralizes, ridicules, or questions the client's honesty.
   - **Direct (DIR)**: Gives an order, command, or direction. The language is imperative.
   - **Raise Concern Without Permission (RCWP)**: Without getting permission, points out a possible problem with a client's goal, plan, or intention.
   - **Warn (WA)**: Provides a warning or threat, implying negative consequences unless the client takes a certain action
   - **Closed Question (CQ)**: A question that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" or with a quick, specific piece of information.
   - **Open Question (OQ)**: A question that leaves latitude for response, allowing the client to elaborate and provide more information.
   - **Facilitate (FA)**: Simple utterance that functions as a "keep-going" acknowledgement e.g. "Mm-hmm", "I see", "Go on"
   - **Filler (FI)**: Pleasantries such as "good morning", "nice weather we're having", etc.
   - **Structure (ST)**: Gives information about will happen directly to the client throughout the course of treatment or within a study format, in this or subsequent sessions.
